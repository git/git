= bdl-lib.sh

== NAME
bdl-lib.sh -- a Bash Debug library scriptlet

== USAGE
Source the scriptlet into a script

+. contrib/bash-debug-library/bdl-lib.sh+

== ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
 bdl_dst
 bdl_call_depth
 bdl_call_stack_view

=== bdl_dst
Defines the default destination which maybe a
file descriptor 1..9 or a file name. If bdl_dst=0
then output is disabled when no destination
parameter is passed.

==== Examples
 bdl_dst=0            # Default output disabled
 bdl_dst=1            # Default output to file descriptor 1, i.e. STDOUT
 bdl_dst=~/git/o      # Default output to file ~/git/o

=== bdl_call_depth
Defines the call depth for retriving the line number
information from the Bash call stack. Set with the
first parameter to bdl_push and restored with bdl_pop.

=== bdl_call_stack_view
Internal environment and when 't' displays the Bash
call stack. Useful for determining what an appropriate
value for the first parameter to bdl_push.

== FUNCTIONS
 bdl
 bdl_push
 bdl_pop

=== bdl
Outputs its parameters to a file descriptor or a
or a file destination. The parameters are preceeded
with the filename and line number of bdl statement.

If the number of parameters == 0 then just the file
name and line number are printed to $bdl_dst.

If the number of parameters == 1 then the file
name and line number are printed followed by a space
and then the parameter to $bdl_dst.

If number of parameters > 1 then the first parameter
is the destination and the other parameters are written
to the destination. The destination rules are the same
as those for bdl_dst.

=== bdl_push
Pushes the current bdl state (bdl_dst, bdl_call_depth,
bdl_call_view_state) onto an internal stack.

If the number of parameters == 0 the state is pushed.

If the number of parameters == 1 the state is pushed and
then the bdl_call_depth set to $1.

If the number of parameters == 2 the state is pushed and
then the bdl_call_depth is set to $1 and $2 is a series
of text lines, typically the content of a test. These
lines are processed so line number information is available
when bdl is used in a test_expect_xxx. See t/test-bdl-lib.sh
for examples.

=== bdl_pop
Pops the previous saved state from a bdl_push, no parameters.
