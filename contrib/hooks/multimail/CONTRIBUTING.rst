Contributing
============

git-multimail is an open-source project, built by volunteers. We would
welcome your help!

The current maintainers are Matthieu Moy
<matthieu.moy@grenoble-inp.fr> and Michael Haggerty
<mhagger@alum.mit.edu>.

Please note that although a copy of git-multimail is distributed in
the "contrib" section of the main Git project, development takes place
in a separate `git-multimail repository on GitHub`_.

Whenever enough changes to git-multimail have accumulated, a new
code-drop of git-multimail will be submitted for inclusion in the Git
project.

We use the GitHub issue tracker to keep track of bugs and feature
requests, and we use GitHub pull requests to exchange patches (though,
if you prefer, you can send patches via the Git mailing list with CC
to the maintainers). Please sign off your patches as per the `Git
project practice
<https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/SubmittingPatches#L234>`__.

Please vote for issues you would like to be addressed in priority
(click "add your reaction" and then the "+1" thumbs-up button on the
GitHub issue).

General discussion of git-multimail can take place on the main `Git
mailing list`_.

Please CC emails regarding git-multimail to the maintainers so that we
don't overlook them.
