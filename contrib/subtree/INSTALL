HOW TO INSTALL git-subtree
==========================

You simply need to copy the file 'git-subtree.sh' to where
the rest of the git scripts are stored. 

From the Git bash window just run:

install.sh 

Or if you have the full Cygwin installed, you can use make:

make install

That will make a 'git subtree' (note: space instead of dash) command
available.  See the file git-subtree.txt for more.

You can also install the man page by doing:

	make doc
	cp git-subtree.1 /usr/share/man/man1/
