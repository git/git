/*
 * Pathname classifications.
 *
 * The daemon classifies the pathnames that it receives from file
 * system notification events into the following categories and uses
 * that to decide whether clients are told about them.  (And to watch
 * for file system synchronization events.)
 *
 * The daemon only collects and reports on the set of modified paths
 * within the working directory (proper).
 *
 * The client should only care about paths within the working
 * directory proper (inside the working directory and not ".git" nor
 * inside of ".git/").  That is, the client has read the index and is
 * asking for a list of any paths in the working directory that have
 * been modified since the last token.  The client does not care about
 * file system changes within the ".git/" directory (such as new loose
 * objects or packfiles).  So the client will only receive paths that
 * are classified as IS_WORKDIR_PATH.
 *
 * Note that ".git" is usually a directory and is therefore inside
 * the cone of the FS watch that we have on the working directory root,
 * so we will also get FS events for disk activity on and within ".git/"
 * that we need to respond to or filter from the client.
 *
 * But Git also allows ".git" to be a *file* that points to a GITDIR
 * outside of the working directory.  When this happens, we need to
 * create FS watches on both the working directory root *and* on the
 * (external) GITDIR root.  (The latter is required because we put
 * cookie files inside it and use them to sync with the FS event
 * stream.)
 *
 * Note that in the context of this discussion, I'm using "GITDIR"
 * to only mean an external GITDIR referenced by a ".git" file.
 *
 * The platform FS event backends will receive watch-specific
 * relative paths (except for those OSes that always emit absolute
 * paths).  We use the following enum and routines to classify each
 * path so that we know how to handle it.  There is a slight asymmetry
 * here because ".git/" is inside the working directory and the
 * (external) GITDIR is not, and therefore how we handle events may
 * vary slightly, so I have different enums for "IS...DOT_GIT..." and
 * "IS...GITDIR...".
 *
 * The daemon uses the IS_DOT_GIT and IS_GITDIR internally to mean the
 * exact ".git" file/directory or GITDIR directory.  If the daemon
 * receives a delete event for either of these paths, it will
 * automatically shutdown, for example.
 *
 * Note that the daemon DOES NOT explicitly watch nor special case the
 * index.  The daemon does not read the index nor have any internal
 * index-relative state, so there are no "IS...INDEX..." enum values.
