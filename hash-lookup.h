 * Searches for hash in table, using the given fanout table to determine the

 *
 * Takes the following parameters:
 *
 *  - hash: the hash to search for
 *  - fanout_nbo: a 256-element array of NETWORK-order 32-bit integers; the
 *    integer at position i represents the number of elements in table whose
 *    first byte is less than or equal to i
 *  - table: a sorted list of hashes with optional extra information in between
 *  - stride: distance between two consecutive elements in table (should be
 *    GIT_MAX_RAWSZ or greater)
 *  - result: if not NULL, this function stores the element index of the
 *    position found (if the search is successful) or the index of the least
 *    element that is greater than hash (if the search is not successful)
 *
 * This function does not verify the validity of the fanout table.
