You can configure some aspects of the GitHub Actions-based CI on a 
per-repository basis by setting "variables" and "secrets" from with the
GitHub web interface. These can be found at:

  https://github.com/<user>/git/settings/secrets/actions

The following variables can be used:

 - CI_BRANCHES

   By default, CI is run when any branch is pushed. If this variable is
   non-empty, then only the branches it lists will run CI. Branch names
   should be separated by spaces, and should use their shortened form
   (e.g., "main", not "refs/heads/main").
