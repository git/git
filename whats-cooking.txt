What's cooking in git.git (Mar 2018, #06; Fri, 30)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

Git 2.17 final is expected to be tagged by early next week.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* jh/partial-clone (2018-03-25) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-28 at 2a0a7aef8e)
 + unpack-trees: release oid_array after use in check_updates()

 Hotfix.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* rs/status-with-removed-submodule (2018-03-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-30 at 8a7b618bc1)
 + submodule: check for NULL return of get_submodule_ref_store()

 "git submodule status" misbehaved on a submodule that has been
 removed from the working tree.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* lv/tls-1.3 (2018-03-29) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-30 at 4f13731408)
 + http: allow use of TLS 1.3

 When built with more recent cURL, GIT_SSL_VERSION can now specify
 "tlsv1.3" as its value.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* nd/warn-more-for-devs (2018-03-29) 3 commits
 - Makefile: add EAGER_DEVELOPER mode
 - Makefile: detect compiler and enable more warnings in DEVELOPER=1
 - connect.c: mark die_initial_contact() NORETURN

 The build procedure "make DEVELOPER=YesPlease" learned to enable a
 bit more warning options depending on the compiler used to help
 developers more.  There also is "make EAGER_DEVELOPER=YesPlease"
 available now, for those who want to help fixing warnings we
 usually ignore.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sb/submodule-move-nested (2018-03-29) 6 commits
 - submodule: fixup nested submodules after moving the submodule
 - submodule-config: remove submodule_from_cache
 - submodule-config: add repository argument to submodule_from_{name, path}
 - submodule-config: allow submodule_free to handle arbitrary repositories
 - grep: remove "repo" arg from non-supporting funcs
 - submodule.h: drop declaration of connect_work_tree_and_git_dir
 (this branch uses nd/remove-ignore-env-field and sb/object-store; is tangled with sb/packfiles-in-repository.)

 Moving a submodule that itself has submodule in it with "git mv"
 forgot to make necessary adjustment to the nested sub-submodules;
 now the codepath learned to recurse into the submodules.


* tb/config-type (2018-03-29) 1 commit
 - builtin/config.c: prefer `--type=bool` over `--bool`, etc.
 (this branch is used by tb/config-default.)

 The "git config" command uses separate options e.g. "--int",
 "--bool", etc. to specify what type the caller wants the value to
 be interpreted as.  A new "--type=<typename>" option has been
 introduced, which would make it cleaner to define new types.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* tb/config-default (2018-03-29) 3 commits
 - builtin/config: introduce `color` type specifier
 - config.c: introduce 'git_config_color' to parse ANSI colors
 - builtin/config: introduce `--default`
 (this branch uses tb/config-type.)

 "git config --get" learned the "--default" option, to help the
 calling script.  Building on top of the tb/config-type topic, the
 "git config" learns "--type=color" type.  Taken together, you can
 do things like "git config --get foo.color --default blue" and get
 the ANSI color sequence for the color given to foo.color variable,
 or "blue" if the variable does not exist.


* eb/cred-helper-ignore-sigpipe (2018-03-29) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-30 at c48e98c1b1)
 + credential: ignore SIGPIPE when writing to credential helpers

 When credential helper exits very quickly without reading its
 input, it used to cause Git to die with SIGPIPE, which has been
 fixed.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* jk/flockfile-stdio (2018-03-30) 1 commit
 - config: move flockfile() closer to unlocked functions


* jk/relative-directory-fix (2018-03-30) 5 commits
 - refs: use chdir_notify to update cached relative paths
 - set_work_tree: use chdir_notify
 - add chdir-notify API
 - trace.c: export trace_setup_key
 - set_git_dir: die when setenv() fails

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* sb/blame-color (2018-02-13) 3 commits
 - builtin/blame: highlight recently changed lines
 - builtin/blame: add option to color metadata fields separately
 - builtin/blame: dim uninteresting metadata

 Expecting a reroll.

* av/fsmonitor-updates (2018-01-04) 6 commits
 - fsmonitor: use fsmonitor data in `git diff`
 - fsmonitor: remove debugging lines from t/t7519-status-fsmonitor.sh
 - fsmonitor: make output of test-dump-fsmonitor more concise
 - fsmonitor: update helper tool, now that flags are filled later
 - fsmonitor: stop inline'ing mark_fsmonitor_valid / _invalid
 - dir.c: update comments to match argument name

 Code clean-up on fsmonitor integration, plus optional utilization
 of the fsmonitor data in diff-files.

 Waiting for an update.

* mk/http-backend-content-length (2017-11-27) 4 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - t5560-http-backend-noserver.sh: add CONTENT_LENGTH cases
 - SQUASH???
 - http-backend: respect CONTENT_LENGTH as specified by rfc3875

 The http-backend (used for smart-http transport) used to slurp the
 whole input until EOF, without paying attention to CONTENT_LENGTH
 that is supplied in the environment and instead expecting the Web
 server to close the input stream.  This has been fixed.

 Expecting a reroll.
 Suggested fixes to be used when rerolling is queued, but I'd
 prefer _not_ squashing them myself.

 Also, it may be too complex solution for the problem.
 cf. <20171204171308.GA13332@sigill.intra.peff.net>


* jk/drop-ancient-curl (2017-08-09) 5 commits
 - http: #error on too-old curl
 - curl: remove ifdef'd code never used with curl >=7.19.4
 - http: drop support for curl < 7.19.4
 - http: drop support for curl < 7.16.0
 - http: drop support for curl < 7.11.1

 Some code in http.c that has bitrot is being removed.

 Expecting a reroll.


* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2017-08-10) 1 commit
 . zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

 Needs resurrecting by making sure the fix is good and still applies
 (or adjusted to today's codebase).

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* ds/bsearch-hash (2018-03-25) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-29 at 561d5577a7)
 + sha1_name: use bsearch_pack() in unique_in_pack()
 + sha1_name: use bsearch_pack() for abbreviations
 + packfile: define and use bsearch_pack()
 + sha1_name: convert struct min_abbrev_data to object_id
 (this branch uses bc/object-id.)

 Code to find the length to uniquely abbreviate object names based
 on packfile content, which is a relatively recent addtion, has been
 optimized to use the same fan-out table.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* jh/json-writer (2018-03-28) 1 commit
 - json_writer: new routines to create data in JSON format

 Is this ready for 'next'?


* jk/diff-highlight-graph-fix (2018-03-21) 7 commits

 + diff-highlight: detect --graph by indent
 + diff-highlight: use flush() helper consistently
 + diff-highlight: test graphs with --color
 + diff-highlight: test interleaved parallel lines of history
 + diff-highlight: prefer "echo" to "cat" in tests
 + diff-highlight: use test_tick in graph test
 + diff-highlight: correct test graph diagram

 "diff-highlight" filter (in contrib/) learned to undertand "git log
 --graph" output better.

 Will cook in 'next'.

* cc/perf-aggregate-sort (2018-03-27) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-29 at 0251068bac)

* jc/test-must-be-empty (2018-03-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-29 at 2e64650f23)
 + test_must_be_empty: simplify file existence check

 Test helper update.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* jk/branch-l-0-deprecation (2018-03-26) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-29 at 552cef7913)
 + branch: deprecate "-l" option
 + t: switch "branch -l" to "branch --create-reflog"
 + t3200: unset core.logallrefupdates when testing reflog creation
 (this branch is used by jk/branch-l-1-removal and jk/branch-l-2-reincarnation.)

 The "-l" option in "git branch -l" is an unfortunate short-hand for
 "--create-reflog", but many users, both old and new, somehow expect
 it to be something else, perhaps "--list".  This step deprecates
 the short-hand and warns about the future removal of the it when it
 is used.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* jk/branch-l-1-removal (2018-03-26) 1 commit
 - branch: drop deprecated "-l" option
 (this branch is used by jk/branch-l-2-reincarnation; uses jk/branch-l-0-deprecation.)

 Following the "git branch -l" deprecation, the short-hand is removed.

 Will keep in 'pu'.


* jk/branch-l-2-reincarnation (2018-03-26) 1 commit
 - branch: make "-l" a synonym for "--list"
 (this branch uses jk/branch-l-0-deprecation and jk/branch-l-1-removal.)

 Following the "git branch -l" removal, "-l" is resurrected as a
 short-hand for "--list".

 Will keep in 'pu'.


* jm/mem-pool (2018-03-27) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-29 at bfce05db6e)
 + Move reusable parts of memory pool into its own file
 + fast-import: introduce mem_pool type
 + fast-import: rename mem_pool type to mp_block

 An reusable "memory pool" implementation has been extracted from
 fast-import.c, which in turn has become the first user of the
 mem-pool API.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* js/runtime-prefix-windows (2018-03-27) 2 commits
 - mingw/msvc: use the new-style RUNTIME_PREFIX helper
 - exec_cmd: provide a new-style RUNTIME_PREFIX helper for Windows
 (this branch uses dj/runtime-prefix.)

 The Windows port was the first that allowed Git to be installed
 anywhere by having its components refer to each other with relative
 pathnames.  The recent dj/runtime-prefix topic extends the idea to
 other platforms, and its approach has been adopted back in the
 Windows port.

 Is this, together with the dj/runtime-prefix topic, ready for
 'next'?


* nd/combined-test-helper (2018-03-27) 36 commits

 The mechanism to use parse-options API to automate the command line
 completion continues to get extended and polished.

 + filter-branch: fix errors caused by refs that point at non-committish

 when refs that do not point at committish are given, "git
 filter-branch" gave a misleading error messages.  This has been
 corrected.

* ys/bisect-object-id-missing-conversion-fix (2018-03-25) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-29 at 7d988b57d4)

* ml/filter-branch-no-op-error (2018-03-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-15 at ba8ac48dec)
 + filter-branch: return 2 when nothing to rewrite

 "git filter-branch" learned to use a different exit code to allow
 the callers to tell the case where there was no new commits to
 rewrite from other error cases.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* ab/install-symlinks (2018-03-15) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-15 at 99d6bd6cb3)
 + Makefile: optionally symlink libexec/git-core binaries to bin/git
 + Makefile: add a gitexecdir_relative variable
 + Makefile: fix broken bindir_relative variable

 The build procedure learned to optionally use symbolic links
 (instead of hardlinks and copies) to install "git-foo" for built-in
 commands, whose binaries are all identical.

* tg/stash-untracked-with-pathspec-fix (2018-03-21) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-22 at 73c4bef74f)
 + stash: drop superfluos pathspec parameter
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-21 at 8f5b5ab131)
 + stash push -u: don't create empty stash
 + stash push: avoid printing errors
 + stash: fix nonsense pipeline

 "git stash push -u -- <pathspec>" gave an unnecessary and confusing
 error message when there was no tracked files that match the
 <pathspec>, which has been fixed.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* pw/rebase-keep-empty-fixes (2018-03-29) 3 commits
 - rebase: respect --no-keep-empty
 - rebase -i --keep-empty: don't prune empty commits
 - rebase --root: stop assuming squash_onto is unset
 (this branch is used by pw/rebase-signoff.)

 "git rebase --keep-empty" still removed an empty commit if the
 other side contained an empty commit (due to the "does an
 equivalent patch exist already?" check), which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* pw/rebase-signoff (2018-03-29) 4 commits
 - rebase --keep-empty: always use interactive rebase
 - rebase -p: error out if --signoff is given
 - rebase: extend --signoff support
 - Merge branch 'pw/rebase-keep-empty-fixes' into pw/rebase-signoff
 (this branch uses pw/rebase-keep-empty-fixes.)

 "git rebase" has learned to honor "--signoff" option when using
 backends other than "am" (but not "--preserve-merges").

 Will merge to 'next'.


* dj/runtime-prefix (2018-03-25) 3 commits
 - exec_cmd: RUNTIME_PREFIX on some POSIX systems
 - Makefile: add Perl runtime prefix support
 - Makefile: generate Perl header from template file
 (this branch is used by js/runtime-prefix-windows.)

 A build-time option has been added to allow Git to be told to refer
 to its associated files relative to the main binary, in the same
 way that has been possible on Windows for quite some time, for
 Linux, BSDs and Darwin.

 Is this, together with the js/runtime-prefix-windows topic, ready
 for 'next'?


* ti/fetch-everything-local-optim (2018-03-14) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-15 at 2be87aa7a7)
 + fetch-pack.c: use oidset to check existence of loose object

 A "git fetch" from a repository with insane number of refs into a
 repository that is already up-to-date still wasted too many cycles
 making many lstat(2) calls to see if these objects at the tips
 exist as loose objects locally.  These lstat(2) calls are optimized
 away by enumerating all loose objects beforehand.

 It is unknown if the new strategy negatively affects existing use
 cases, fetching into a repository with many loose objects from a
 repository with small number of refs.

 + shortlog: disallow left-over arguments outside repo
 + shortlog: add usage-string for stdin-reading
 + git-shortlog.txt: reorder usages

 "git shortlog cruft" aborted with a BUG message when run outside a
 Git repository.  The command has been taught to complain about
 extra and unwanted arguments on its command line instead in such a
 case.

* ab/pcre-v2 (2018-03-14) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-15 at e77b116903)
 + Makefile: make USE_LIBPCRE=YesPlease mean v2, not v1
 + configure: detect redundant --with-libpcre & --with-libpcre1
 + configure: fix a regression in PCRE v1 detection

 Git can be built to use either v1 or v2 of the PCRE library, and so
 far, the build-time configuration USE_LIBPCRE=YesPlease instructed
 the build procedure to use v1, but now it means v2.  USE_LIBPCRE1
 and USE_LIBPCRE2 can be used to explicitly choose which version to
 use, as before.

* bb/git-gui-ssh-key-files (2018-03-02) 2 commits
 - Merge branch 'bb/ssh-key-files' of git-gui into bb/git-gui-ssh-key-files
 - git-gui: search for all current SSH key types

 "git gui" learned that "~/.ssh/id_ecdsa.pub" and
 "~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub" are also possible SSH key files.


* bp/git-gui-bind-kp-enter (2018-03-02) 2 commits
 - Merge branch 'bp/bind-kp-enter' of git-gui into bp/git-gui-bind-kp-enter
 - git-gui: bind CTRL/CMD+numpad ENTER to do_commit

 "git gui" performs commit upon CTRL/CMD+ENTER but the
 CTRL/CMD+KP_ENTER (i.e. enter key on the numpad) did not have the
 same key binding.  It now does.


* cb/git-gui-ttk-style (2018-03-05) 2 commits
 - Merge branch 'cb/ttk-style' of git-gui into cb/git-gui-ttk-style
 - git-gui: workaround ttk:style theme use

 "git gui" has been taught to work with old versions of tk (like
 8.5.7) that do not support "ttk::style theme use" as a way to query
 the current theme.


* nd/pack-objects-pack-struct (2018-03-26) 13 commits
 - pack-objects: reorder members to shrink struct object_entry
 - pack-objects: shrink delta_size field in struct object_entry
 - pack-objects: shrink size field in struct object_entry
 - pack-objects: clarify the use of object_entry::size
 - pack-objects: don't check size when the object is bad
 - pack-objects: shrink z_delta_size field in struct object_entry
 - pack-objects: refer to delta objects by index instead of pointer
 - pack-objects: move in_pack out of struct object_entry
 - pack-objects: move in_pack_pos out of struct object_entry
 - pack-objects: use bitfield for object_entry::depth
 - pack-objects: use bitfield for object_entry::dfs_state
 - pack-objects: turn type and in_pack_type to bitfields
 - pack-objects: a bit of document about struct object_entry

 "git pack-objects" needs to allocate tons of "struct object_entry"
 while doing its work, and shrinking its size helps the performance
 quite a bit.


* nd/repack-keep-pack (2018-03-26) 7 commits
 - pack-objects: show some progress when counting kept objects
 - gc --auto: exclude base pack if not enough mem to "repack -ad"
 - gc: handle a corner case in gc.bigPackThreshold
 - gc: add gc.bigPackThreshold config
 - gc: add --keep-largest-pack option
 - repack: add --keep-pack option
 - t7700: have closing quote of a test at the beginning of line

 "git gc" in a large repository takes a lot of time as it considers
 to repack all objects into one pack by default.  The command has
 been taught to pretend as if the largest existing packfile is
 marked with ".keep" so that it is left untouched while objects in
 other packs and loose ones are repacked.

 Reroll exists, but it seems to be still slushy.

* nd/worktree-prune (2018-03-15) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-20 at e2d9677b20)
 + worktree prune: improve prune logic when worktree is moved
 + worktree: delete dead code
 + gc.txt: more details about what gc does

 The way "git worktree prune" worked internally has been simplified,
 by assuming how "git worktree move" moves an existing worktree to a
 different place.

* pw/add-p-select (2018-03-16) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-30 at eae69f5ded)
 + add -p: optimize line selection for short hunks
 + add -p: allow line selection to be inverted
 + add -p: select individual hunk lines

 "git add -p" interactive interface learned to let users choose
 individual added/removed lines to be used in the operation, instead
 of accepting or rejecting a whole hunk.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* ld/p4-unshelve (2018-02-22) 1 commit
 - git-p4: add unshelve command

 "git p4" learned to "unshelve" shelved commit from P4.

 Will hold, perhaps drop and use format-change that uses a proper "diff".

 + repository: initialize the_repository in main()
 (this branch is used by sb/object-store, sb/packfiles-in-repository and sb/submodule-move-nested.)

 Code clean-up for the "repository" abstraction.

 Refactoring the internal global data structure to make it possible
 to open multiple repositories, work with and then close them.

 Rerolled by Duy on top of a separate preliminary clean-up topic.
 The resulting structure of the topics looked very sensible.

 + directory rename detection: basic testcases

 Rename detection logic in "diff" family that is used in "merge" has
 learned to guess when all of x/a, x/b and x/c have moved to z/a,
 z/b and z/c, it is likely that x/d added in the meantime would also
 want to move to z/d by taking the hint that the entire directory
 'x' moved to 'z'.  A bug causing dirty files involved in a rename
 to be overwritten during merge has also been fixed as part of this
 work.

 Will cook in 'next'.
