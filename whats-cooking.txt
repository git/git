What's cooking in git.git (Jul 2021, #02; Thu, 8)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen',
which means nothing more than that I have found them of interest for
some reason (like "it may have hard-to-resolve conflicts with
another topic already in flight" or "this may turn out to be
useful").  Do not read too much into a topic being in (or not in)
'seen'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of the
integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

 exporting a fixed value in the COLUMNS environment.

  (merged to 'next' on 2021-07-01 at 9fa432af22)
 + t: use user-specified utf-8 locale for testing svn

 "git-svn" tests assumed that "locale -a", which is used to pick an
 available UTF-8 locale, is available everywhere.  A knob has been
 introduced to allow testers to specify a suitable locale to use.

  (merged to 'next' on 2021-07-01 at 2e0f108bb6)

* js/stop-exporting-bogus-columns (2021-06-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-07-02 at 7674896d58)
 + pager: avoid setting COLUMNS when we're guessing its value

 When we cannot figure out how wide the terminal is, we use a
 fallback value of 80 ourselves (which cannot be avoided), but when
 we run the pager, we export it in COLUMNS, which forces the pager
 to use the hardcoded value, even when the pager is perfectly
 capable to figure it out itself.  Stop exporting COLUMNS when we
 fall back on the hardcoded default value for our own use.

* jx/sideband-cleanup (2021-06-17) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-07-01 at 0eb604e8c2)
 + test: refactor to use "get_abbrev_oid" to get abbrev oid
 + test: refactor to use "test_commit" to create commits
 + test: compare raw output, not mangle tabs and spaces
 + sideband: don't lose clear-to-eol at packet boundary

 The side-band demultiplexer that is used to display progress output
 from the remote end did not clear the line properly when the end of
 line hits at a packet boundary, which has been corrected.  Also
 comes with test clean-ups.

* ao/p4-avoid-decoding (2021-04-12) 2 commits
 - git-p4: do not decode data from perforce by default
 - git-p4: avoid decoding more data from perforce

 "git p4" in Python-2 days used to accept a lot more kinds of data
 from Perforce server as uninterrupted byte sequence, but after
 switching to Python-3, too many things are expected to be in UTF-8,
 which broke traditional use cases.

 - fsck: don't hard die on invalid object types
 - object-file.c: return -2 on "header too long" in unpack_loose_header()
 - object-file.c: return -1, not "status" from unpack_loose_header()
 - object-file.c: guard against future bugs in loose_object_info()
 - object-file.c: stop dying in parse_loose_header()
 - object-file.c: split up ternary in parse_loose_header()
 - object-file.c: simplify unpack_loose_short_header()
 - object-file.c: add missing braces to loose_object_info()
 - object-file.c: make parse_loose_header_extended() public
 - object-file.c: don't set "typep" when returning non-zero
 - cache.h: move object functions to object-store.h
 - cat-file tests: test for current --allow-unknown-type behavior
 - cat-file tests: add corrupt loose object test
 - rev-list tests: test for behavior with invalid object types
 - cat-file tests: test that --allow-unknown-type isn't on by default
 - cat-file tests: test for missing object with -t and -s
 - fsck tests: add test for fsck-ing an unknown type
 - fsck tests: refactor one test to use a sub-repo

 "git fsck" has been taught to report mismatch between expected and
 actual types of an object better.

 Needs review.
