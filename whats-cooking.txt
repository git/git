What's cooking in git.git (Jul 2020, #04; Wed, 22)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'seen' (formerly 'pu'---proposed updates) while commits prefixed
with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

I just tagged Git 2.28-rc2; we should be pretty in a good shape and
hopefully the only difference between this and the final would just
be the translation.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches of the
repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

[Graduated to 'master']

* dl/branch-cleanup (2020-07-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-07-18 at 942efa1f99)
 + t3200: don't grep for `strerror()` string

 Last minute fix-up to tests for portability.


* en/sparse-status (2020-07-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-07-20 at 6aa5c12b74)
 + git-prompt: change == to = for zsh's sake

 Fix to a "git prompt" regression during this development cycle.


* jc/relnotes-v0-extension-update (2020-07-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-07-18 at 4e03396489)
 + RelNotes: update the v0 with extension situation

 Last minute fix-up to the release notes.


* jn/v0-with-extensions-fix (2020-07-16) 2 commits
 + repository: allow repository format upgrade with extensions
 + Revert "check_repository_format_gently(): refuse extensions for old repositories"
 (this branch is used by jk/reject-newer-extensions-in-v0.)

 In 2.28-rc0, we corrected a bug that some repository extensions are
 honored by mistake even in a version 0 repositories (these
 configuration variables in extensions.* namespace were supposed to
 have special meaning in repositories whose version numbers are 1 or
 higher), but this was a bit too big a change.


* js/pu-to-seen (2020-07-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-07-18 at bb6ee9441b)
 + gitworkflows.txt: fix broken subsection underline

 Last minute fix-up to documentation.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* jk/reject-newer-extensions-in-v0 (2020-07-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-07-16 at 85f634d5a6)
 + verify_repository_format(): complain about new extensions in v0 repo

 With the base fix to 2.27 regresion, any new extensions in a v0
 repository would still be silently honored, which is not quite
 right.  Instead, complain and die loudly.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* en/fill-directory-exponential (2020-07-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-07-22 at 63662d6646)
 + dir: check pathspecs before returning `path_excluded`

 Fix to a regression introduced during 2.27 cycle.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* bc/push-cas-cquoted-refname (2020-07-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-07-21 at fd7bb5c85e)
 + remote-curl: make --force-with-lease work with non-ASCII ref names

 Pushing a ref whose name contains non-ASCII character with the
 "--force-with-lease" option did not work over smart HTTP protocol,
 which has been corrected.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* ct/mv-unmerged-path-error (2020-07-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-07-21 at c17007237a)
 + git-mv: improve error message for conflicted file

 "git mv src dst", when src is an unmerged path, errored out
 correctly but with an incorrect error message to claim that src is
 not tracked, which has been clarified.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* jt/pack-objects-prefetch-in-batch (2020-07-21) 2 commits
 - pack-objects: prefetch objects to be packed
 - pack-objects: refactor to oid_object_info_extended

 While packing many objects in a repository with a promissor remote,
 lazily fetching missing objects from the promissor remote one by
 one may be inefficient---the code now attempts to fetch all the
 missing objects in batch (obviously this won't work for a lazy
 clone that lazily fetches tree objects as you cannot even enumerate
 what blobs are missing until you learn which trees are missing).

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jt/pretend-object-never-come-from-elsewhere (2020-07-21) 1 commit
 - sha1-file: make pretend_object_file() not prefetch

 The pretend-object mechanism checks if the given object already
 exists in the object store before deciding to keep the data
 in-core, but the check would have triggered lazy fetching of such
 an object from a promissor remote.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sg/ci-git-path-fix-with-pyenv (2020-07-21) 1 commit
 - travis-ci: remove bogus 'pyenv' in the Linux jobs

 CI fixup---tests of Python scripts didn't use the version of Git
 that is being tested.

 Will merge to 'next'.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* jx/proc-receive-hook (2020-05-18) 11 commits
 - doc: add documentation for the proc-receive hook
 - transport: parse report options for tracking refs
 - t5411: test updates of remote-tracking branches
 - receive-pack: new config receive.procReceiveRefs
 - refs.c: refactor to reuse ref_is_hidden()

 - New capability "report-status-v2" for git-push
 - receive-pack: add new proc-receive hook
 - t5411: add basic test cases for proc-receive hook
 - transport: not report a non-head push as a branch

 "git receive-pack" that accepts requests by "git push" learned to
 outsource most of the ref updates to the new "proc-receive" hook.

 Needs review.


* mf/submodule-summary-with-correct-repository (2020-06-24) 2 commits
 - submodule: use submodule repository when preparing summary
 - revision: use repository from rev_info when parsing commits

 "git diff/show" on a change that involves a submodule used to read
 the information on commits in the submodule from a wrong repository
 and gave a wrong information when the commit-graph is involved.

 Needs tests.


* dr/push-remoteref-fix (2020-04-23) 1 commit
 - remote.c: fix handling of %(push:remoteref)

 The "%(push:remoteref)" placeholder in the "--format=" argument of
 "git format-patch" (and friends) only showed what got explicitly
 configured, not what ref at the receiving end would be updated when
 "git push" was used, as it ignored the default behaviour (e.g. update
 the same ref as the source).

 Expecting a reroll.

 - bisect--helper: BUG() in cmd_*() on invalid subcommand

 Rewrite of the remainder of "git bisect" script in C continues.

 Needs more work.


* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2018-10-15) 1 commit
 - zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

 with predictable (artificial) timestamps.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* jc/no-update-fetch-head (2020-07-13) 1 commit
 - fetch: optionally allow disabling FETCH_HEAD update

 "git fetch" learned the "--[no-]write-fetch-head" option to

  (merged to 'next' on 2020-07-20 at 28e85288e5)
 + upload-pack: do not lazy-fetch "have" objects

 Fetching from a lazily cloned repository resulted at the server
 side in attempts to lazy fetch objects that the client side has,
 many of which will not be available from the third-party anyway.

 Will cook in 'next'.

 repository maintenance tasks, not limited to the object database
 cleaning.


* bw/fail-cloning-into-non-empty (2020-07-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-07-14 at a52b5ce7ab)
 + git clone: don't clone into non-empty directory

 "git clone --separate-git-dir=$elsewhere" used to stomp on the

* ls/mergetool-meld-auto-merge (2020-07-12) 2 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - Support auto-merge for meld to follow the vim-diff behavior

 The 'meld' backend of the "git mergetool" learned to give the
 underlying 'meld' the '--auto-merge' option, which would help
 reduce the amount of text that requires manual merging.

 Expecting a reroll.

* mt/hash-to-hex-thread-safety (2020-06-26) 2 commits
 - hex: make hash_to_hex_algop() and friends thread-safe
 - compat/win32/pthread: add pthread_once()

 hash_to_hex() used a set of rotating static buffers, which was not
 safe to use in a threaded environment.  This has been made safer by
 using thread-local storage.

 Expecting a reroll.

 - rebase -i: support --ignore-date
 - sequencer: rename amend_author to author_to_free
