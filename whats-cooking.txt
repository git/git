What's cooking in git.git (Oct 2021, #05; Mon, 18)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen',
which means nothing more than that I have found them of interest for
some reason (like "it may have hard-to-resolve conflicts with
another topic already in flight" or "this may turn out to be
useful").  Do not read too much into a topic being in (or not in)
'seen'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of the
integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

The fourteenth batch of topics are in 'master'.  It has only been
just a few days since the last batch, but I'd be offline tomorrow
(a forced day-off), so I'm merging them a bit earlier.

I expect that things will start to calm down in preparation for the
release expected in mid November.  Topics that are not marked with
any plans may be in that status because they didn't get much
attention by reviewers, in which case you folks know what to do ;-)

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

 An editor session launched during a Git operation (e.g. during 'git
 commit') can leave the terminal in a funny state.  The code path
 has updated to save the terminal state before, and restore it
 after, it spawns an editor.

  (merged to 'next' on 2021-10-06 at 80a9cda797)

* jk/cat-file-batch-all-wo-replace (2021-10-08) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-10-11 at 9415f7c43a)
 + cat-file: use packed_object_info() for --batch-all-objects
 + cat-file: split ordered/unordered batch-all-objects callbacks
 + cat-file: disable refs/replace with --batch-all-objects
 + cat-file: mention --unordered along with --batch-all-objects
 + t1006: clean up broken objects

 "git cat-file --batch" with the "--batch-all-objects" option is
 supposed to iterate over all the objects found in a repository, but
 it used to translate these object names using the replace mechanism,
 which defeats the point of enumerating all objects in the repository.
 This has been corrected.


* js/retire-preserve-merges (2021-09-07) 11 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-09-10 at f645ffd7a3)

  (merged to 'next' on 2021-10-14 at 3047fe56fc)
 + ci(windows): ensure that we do not pick up random executables

 The PATH used in CI job may be too wide and let incompatible dlls
 to be grabbed, which can cause the build&test to fail.  Tighten it.


* mt/grep-submodule-textconv (2021-09-29) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-10-06 at 1950944b8c)
 + grep: demonstrate bug with textconv attributes and submodules

 "git grep --recurse-submodules" takes trees and blobs from the
 submodule repository, but the textconv settings when processing a
 blob from the submodule is not taken from the submodule repository.
 A test is added to demonstrate the issue, without fixing it.


* rs/make-verify-path-really-verify-again (2021-10-07) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-10-11 at 6b4358876f)
 + read-cache: let verify_path() reject trailing dir separators again
 + read-cache: add verify_path_internal()
 + t3905: show failure to ignore sub-repo

 Recent sparse-index work broke safety against attempts to add paths
 with trailing slashes to the index, which has been corrected.

 + test-mergesort: add generate subcommand
 + test-mergesort: add test subcommand
 + test-mergesort: add sort subcommand
 + test-mergesort: use strbuf_getline()

 The mergesort implementation used to sort linked list has been
 optimized.


* tb/repack-write-midx (2021-10-07) 10 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-10-08 at ff8fec247e)

 bitmaps.

* mp/absorb-submodule-git-dir-upon-deinit (2021-10-07) 1 commit
 - submodule: absorb git dir instead of dying on deinit

 "git submodule deinit" for a submodule whose .git metadata
 directory is embedded in its working tree refused to work, until
 the submodule gets converted to use the "absorbed" form where the
 metadata directory is stored in superproject, and a gitfile at the
 top-level of the working tree of the submodule points at it.  The
 command is taught to convert such submodules to the absorbed form
 as needed.

 Under review.

 (this branch uses ns/tmp-objdir.)

 A new presentation for two-parent merge "--remerge-diff" can be
 used to show the difference between mechanical (and possibly
 conflicted) merge results and the recorded resolution.

 On hold.
 This is Elijah's remerge-diff rebased on ns/tmp-objdir to share the
 "create objects temporarily, only to discard without committing
 them to longer-term storage" infrastructure with another topic.


* ns/tmp-objdir (2021-10-04) 2 commits
 - tmp-objdir: disable ref updates when replacing the primary odb

 (this branch is used by ns/batched-fsync and ns/remerge-diff.)

 quarantine feature.

 + sparse index: fix use-after-free bug in cache_tree_verify()

 Recent sparse-index addition, namely any use of index_name_pos(),
 can expand sparse index entries and breaks any code that walks
 cache-tree or existing index entries.  One such instance of such a
 breakage has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 default values.

 which codepaths the helper is used and to do what, and tests to
 protect the fixes.
