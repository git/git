What's cooking in git.git (Nov 2017, #03; Wed, 8)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

The tip of 'next' has been rebuilt on top of v2.15, while kicking a
few topics back to 'pu'.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

* bw/rebase-i-ignored-submodule-fix (2017-11-07) 1 commit
 - wt-status: actually ignore submodules when requested

 "git rebase -i" recently started misbehaving when a submodule that
 is configured with 'submodule.<name>.ignore' is dirty; this has
 been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.
 I've edited in the tweak brought up in the discussion.  Please
 eyeball to sanity check.


* ar/unconfuse-three-dots (2017-11-07) 3 commits
 - Documentation: revisions: add note about 3dots usages as continuation indications
 - Documentation: user-manual: limit potentially confusing usage of 3dots (and 2dots)
 - checkout: describe_detached_head: remove 3dots after committish

 Ancient part of codebase still shows dots after an abbreviated
 object name just to show that it is not a full object name, but
 these ellipses are confusing to people who newly discovered Git
 who are used to seeing abbreviated object names and find them
 confusing with the range syntax.


* jt/submodule-tests-cleanup (2017-11-08) 1 commit
 - Tests: clean up and document submodule helpers

 Will merge to 'next'.

* jn/ssh-wrappers (2017-10-30) 6 commits
 - fixup! ssh: 'auto' variant to select between 'ssh' and 'simple'
 - ssh: 'simple' variant does not support --port
 - ssh: 'simple' variant does not support -4/-6
 - ssh: 'auto' variant to select between 'ssh' and 'simple'
 - connect: split ssh command line options into separate function
 - connect: split git:// setup into a separate function
 (this branch uses bw/protocol-v1.)

 The ssh-variant 'simple' introduced earlier broke existing
 installations by not passing --port/-4/-6 and not diagnosing an
 attempt to pass these as an error.  Instead, default to
 automatically detect how compatible the GIT_SSH/GIT_SSH_COMMAND is
 to OpenSSH convention and then error out an invocation to make it
 easier to diagnose connection errors.

 Expecting a reroll.

* jc/merge-symlink-ours-theirs (2017-09-26) 1 commit
 - merge: teach -Xours/-Xtheirs to symbolic link merge

 "git merge -Xours/-Xtheirs" learned to use our/their version when
 resolving a conflicting updates to a symbolic link.

 Needs review.


* mg/merge-base-fork-point (2017-09-17) 3 commits
 - merge-base: find fork-point outside partial reflog
 - merge-base: return fork-point outside reflog
 - t6010: test actual test output

 "merge-base --fork-point $branch $commit" is used to guess on which
 commit among the commits that were once at the tip of the $branch the
 $commit was built on top of, and it learns these historical tips from
 the reflog of the $branch.  When the true fork-point is lost due to
 pruning of old reflog entries, the command does not give any output,
 because it has no way to guess correctly and does not want to mislead
 the user with a wrong guess.

 The command has been updated to give the best but not known to be
 correct guess, based on a hope that a merge-base between $commit and a
 virtual merge across all the reflog entries that still are available
 for $branch may still be a closer to the true fork-point than the
 merge-base between $commit and the current tip of the $branch.

 This may have to be offered by an additional option, to allow the
 users that are prepared to see a potentially incorrect guess to opt
 into the feature, without affecting the current callers that may not
 be prepared to accept a guess that is not known to be correct.

 What's the doneness of this one?

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

 Needs resurrecting by making sure the fix is good and still applies
 (or adjusted to today's codebase).

 + status: test ignored modes
 + status: document options to show matching ignored files
 + status: report matching ignored and normal untracked
 + status: add option to show ignored files differently

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2017-11-01

 The set of paths output from "git status --ignored" was tied
 closely with its "--untracked=<mode>" option, but now it can be
 controlled more flexibly.  Most notably, a directory that is
 ignored because it is listed to be ignored in the ignore/exclude
 mechanism can be handled differently from a directory that ends up
 to be ignored only because all files in it are ignored.

 to the same SVN repository without the username@ and failed when
 svn.pushmergeinfo option is set.

* jk/ui-color-always-to-auto-maint (2017-10-13) 2 commits
 . color: document that "git -c color.*=always" is a bit special
 . color: downgrade "always" to "auto" only for on-disk configuration

 It turns out that "git -c color.ui=always cmd" is relied on by many
 third-party tools as a way to force coloured output no matter what
 the end-user configuration is, and a recent attempt to downgrade
 'always' to 'auto' to fix the regression to "git add -p" broke it.

 This has been reverted from 'next'.

 A journey for "git clone" and "git fetch" to become "lazier" by
 depending more on its remote repository---this is the beginning of
 it.

 Superseded by three topics that end with jh/partial-clone.

 . dir: allow exclusions from blob in addition to file

 The code to read exclusion list from a blob, which is used when the
 .gitignore file is outside a sparse checkout area, has been
 refactored so that other codepath can later use it to do the same
 outside the context of "sparse checkout".

 Now part of jh/object-filtering topic.
