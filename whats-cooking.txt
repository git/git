What's cooking in git.git (Feb 2018, #03; Wed, 21)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

 + Makefile: under "make dist", include the sha1collisiondetection submodule
 + Makefile: don't error out under DC_SHA1_EXTERNAL if DC_SHA1_SUBMODULE=auto

 Push the submodule version of collision-detecting SHA-1 hash
 implementation a bit harder on builders.

 + wildmatch test: don't try to vertically align our output
 + wildmatch test: use more standard shell style
 + wildmatch test: indent with tabs, not spaces

 More tests for wildmatch functions.


* bc/hash-algo (2018-02-09) 13 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-09 at 4437f3f132)
 + hash: update obsolete reference to SHA1_HEADER
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-08 at 18f36d12ed)
 + bulk-checkin: abstract SHA-1 usage
 + csum-file: abstract uses of SHA-1
 + csum-file: rename sha1file to hashfile
 + read-cache: abstract away uses of SHA-1
 + pack-write: switch various SHA-1 values to abstract forms

 More abstraction of hash function from the codepath.


* cc/perf-aggregate (2018-02-02) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-08 at d8f074e6fb)
 + perf/aggregate: sort JSON fields in output
 + perf/aggregate: add --reponame option
 + perf/aggregate: add --subsection option

 "make perf" enhancement.


* en/merge-recursive-fixes (2018-01-19) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-08 at c254292070)
 + merge-recursive: add explanation for src_entry and dst_entry
 + merge-recursive: fix logic ordering issue
 + Tighten and correct a few testcases for merging and cherry-picking
 (this branch is used by en/rename-directory-detection.)


* gs/rebase-allow-empty-message (2018-02-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-08 at 9d81a2496c)
 + rebase: add --allow-empty-message option

 "git rebase" learned to take "--allow-empty-message" option.


* jc/worktree-add-short-help (2018-01-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-08 at 9f59ca72ab)
 + worktree: say that "add" takes an arbitrary commit in short-help

 Error message fix.


* jt/fsck-code-cleanup (2018-01-23) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-08 at 199ad41486)
 + fsck: fix leak when traversing trees

 Plug recently introduced leaks in fsck.


* kg/packed-ref-cache-fix (2018-01-24) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-08 at 370f06a565)
 + packed_ref_cache: don't use mmap() for small files
 + load_contents(): don't try to mmap an empty file
 + packed_ref_iterator_begin(): make optimization more general
 + find_reference_location(): make function safe for empty snapshots
 + create_snapshot(): use `xmemdupz()` rather than a strbuf
 + struct snapshot: store `start` rather than `header_len`

 Avoid mmapping small files while using packed refs (especially ones
 with zero size, which would cause later munmap() to fail).
 A change to a binsearch loop to work around picky complers was
 unnecessarily hard to reason about, but it should do.


* lw/daemon-log-destination (2018-02-05) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-08 at da91bd56f4)
 + daemon: add --log-destination=(stderr|syslog|none)

 The log from "git daemon" can be redirected with a new option; one
 relevant use case is to send the log to standard error (instead of
 syslog) when running it from inetd.


* nd/format-patch-stat-width (2018-02-02) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-08 at c03e8a084e)
 + format-patch: reduce patch diffstat width to 72
 + format-patch: keep cover-letter diffstat wrapped in 72 columns

 "git format-patch" learned to give 72-cols to diffstat, which is
 consistent with other line length limits the subcommand uses for
 its output meant for e-mails.


* nd/ignore-glob-doc-update (2018-02-02) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-08 at 22ba92e49b)
 + gitignore.txt: elaborate shell glob syntax

 Doc update.


* nd/trace-index-ops (2018-02-02) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-08 at 91e362b26a)
 + trace: measure where the time is spent in the index-heavy operations


* po/object-id (2018-01-30) 12 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-08 at 701311e8ea)
 + sha1_file: rename hash_sha1_file_literally
 + sha1_file: convert write_loose_object to object_id
 + sha1_file: convert force_object_loose to object_id
 + sha1_file: convert write_sha1_file to object_id
 + notes: convert write_notes_tree to object_id
 + notes: convert combine_notes_* to object_id
 + commit: convert commit_tree* to object_id
 + match-trees: convert splice_tree to object_id
 + cache: clear whole hash buffer with oidclr
 + sha1_file: convert hash_sha1_file to object_id
 + dir: convert struct sha1_stat to use object_id
 + sha1_file: convert pretend_sha1_file to object_id

 Conversion from uchar[20] to struct object_id continues.


* rs/cocci-strbuf-addf-to-addstr (2018-02-02) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-08 at 0016008a97)
 + cocci: simplify check for trivial format strings


* sb/pull-rebase-submodule (2018-01-25) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-08 at 38fa97f855)
 + builtin/pull: respect verbosity settings in submodules

 "git pull --rebase" did not pass verbosity setting down when
 recursing into a submodule.


* sg/test-i18ngrep (2018-02-08) 9 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-08 at e83eb33909)
 + t: make 'test_i18ngrep' more informative on failure
 + t: validate 'test_i18ngrep's parameters
 + t: move 'test_i18ncmp' and 'test_i18ngrep' to 'test-lib-functions.sh'
 + t5536: let 'test_i18ngrep' read the file without redirection
 + t5510: consolidate 'grep' and 'test_i18ngrep' patterns
 + t4001: don't run 'git status' upstream of a pipe
 + t6022: don't run 'git merge' upstream of a pipe
 + t5812: add 'test_i18ngrep's missing filename parameter
 + t5541: add 'test_i18ngrep's missing filename parameter

 Test fixes.


* tg/reset-hard-show-head-with-pretty (2018-02-02) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-08 at 596a4ec00d)
 + reset --hard: make use of the pretty machinery

 The way "git reset --hard" reports the commit the updated HEAD
 points at is made consistent with the way how the commit title is
 generated by the other parts of the system.  This matters when the
 title is spread across physically multiple lines.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* bp/fsmonitor (2018-02-14) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-14 at 5c508858fb)
 + fsmonitor: update documentation to remove reference to invalid config settings

 Doc update for a recently added feature.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/sq-dequote-on-bogus-input (2018-02-14) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-14 at 75d4f1eaf8)
 + sq_dequote: fix extra consumption of source string

 Code to unquote single-quoted string (used in the parser for
 configuration files, etc.) did not diagnose bogus input correctly
 and produced bogus results instead.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/test-hashmap-updates (2018-02-14) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-14 at a61a9bd8f0)
 + test-hashmap: use "unsigned int" for hash storage
 + test-hashmap: simplify alloc_test_entry
 + test-hashmap: use strbuf_getline rather than fgets
 + test-hashmap: use xsnprintf rather than snprintf
 + test-hashmap: check allocation computation for overflow
 + test-hashmap: use ALLOC_ARRAY rather than bare malloc

 Code clean-up.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* nd/am-quit (2018-02-14) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-21 at 9a9cb40c2f)
 + am: support --quit

 "git am" has learned "--quit" option, in addition to the existing
 "--abort" option; having the pair mirrors a few other commands like
 "rebase" and "cherry-pick".

 Will merge to 'master'.


* nd/tilde-expand-opt-file-value (2018-02-14) 2 commits
 - init-db: change --template type to OPTION_FILENAME
 - parse-options: expand $HOME on filename options

 "git cmd --opt=~u/path/to/file" did not tilde-expand "~u" part to
 the path to the home directory of user 'u'

 Will discard.
 This may make the resulting whole more confusing, though.
 cf. <87wozffavp.fsf@evledraar.gmail.com>


* rd/typofix (2018-02-14) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-14 at e770601de4)
 + Correct mispellings of ".gitmodule" to ".gitmodules"
 + t/: correct obvious typo "detahced"

 Typofix.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/allow-ff-merging-kept-tags (2018-02-16) 1 commit
 - merge: allow fast-forward when merging a tracked tag

 Since Git 1.7.9, "git merge" defaulted to --no-ff (i.e. even when
 the side branch being merged is a descendant of the current commit,
 create a merge commit instead of fast-forwarding) when merging a
 tag object.  This was appropriate default for integrators who pull
 signed tags from their downstream contributors, but caused an
 unnecessary merges when used by downstream contributors who
 habitually "catch up" their topic branches with tagged releases
 from the upstream.  Update "git merge" to default to --no-ff only
 when merging a tag object that does *not* sit at its usual place in
 refs/tags/ hierarchy, and allow fast-forwarding otherwise, to
 mitigate the problem.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ab/perl-fixes (2018-02-15) 2 commits
 - perl: move CPAN loader wrappers to another namespace
 - perl: *.pm files should not have the executable bit

 Only the first few of a series of several small patches.

 Expecting a reroll.


* ab/simplify-perl-makefile (2018-02-15) 1 commit
 - Makefile: generate Git(3pm) as dependency of the 'doc' and 'man' targets

 Hotfix for a topic already in 'master'.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* es/worktree-add-post-checkout-hook (2018-02-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-21 at 6ef6a130bf)
 + worktree: add: fix 'post-checkout' not knowing new worktree location

 "git worktree add" learned to run the post-checkout hook, just like
 "git clone" runs it upon the initial checkout.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* sb/status-doc-fix (2018-02-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-21 at 5e68f3dac8)
 + Documentation/git-status: clarify status table for porcelain mode

 Docfix.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* tk/apply-dev-null-verify-name-fix (2018-02-15) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-21 at dab449203b)
 + apply: handle Subversion diffs with /dev/null gracefully
 + apply: demonstrate a problem applying svn diffs

 Many places in "git apply" knew that "/dev/null" that signals
 "there is no such file on this side of the diff" can be followed by
 whitespace and garbage when parsing a patch, except for one, which
 made an otherwise valid patch (e.g. ones from subversion) rejected.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* gs/test-unset-xdg-cache-home (2018-02-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-21 at 9aec46d404)
 + test-lib.sh: unset XDG_CACHE_HOME

 Test update.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* tg/worktree-create-tracking (2018-02-16) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-21 at 3e00a10cd8)
 + git-worktree.txt: fix indentation of example and text of 'add' command
 + git-worktree.txt: fix missing ")" typo

 Hotfix for a recent topic.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/push-options-via-transport-fix (2018-02-20) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-21 at a037cbfa2b)
 + remote-curl: unquote incoming push-options
 + t5545: factor out http repository setup

 "git push" over http transport did not unquote the push-options
 correctly.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* tz/do-not-clean-spec-file (2018-02-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-21 at c1336418a8)
 + Makefile: remove *.spec from clean target

 We no longer create any *.spec file, so "make clean" should not
 remove it.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* bw/doc-submodule-recurse-config-with-clone (2018-02-21) 1 commit
 - submodule: indicate that 'submodule.recurse' doesn't apply to clone

 Doc update.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ds/commit-graph (2018-02-20) 13 commits
 - commit-graph: build graph from starting commits
 - commit-graph: read only from specific pack-indexes
 - commit: integrate commit graph with commit parsing
 - commit-graph: close under reachability
 - commit-graph: add core.commitGraph setting
 - commit-graph: implement --delete-expired
 - commit-graph: implement --set-latest
 - commit-graph: implement git commit-graph read
 - commit-graph: implement 'git-commit-graph write'
 - commit-graph: implement write_commit_graph()
 - commit-graph: create git-commit-graph builtin
 - graph: add commit graph design document
 - commit-graph: add format document
 (this branch uses jt/binsearch-with-fanout.)


* ot/ref-filter-cleanup (2018-02-21) 2 commits
 - ref-filter: get rid of goto
 - ref-filter: get rid of duplicate code

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* np/send-email-header-parsing (2017-12-15) 1 commit
 - send-email: extract email-parsing code into a subroutine

 Code refactoring.

 Undecided but inclined to drop.  A "refactor" without the code that
 benefit from the refactoring is hard to tell from code churn whose
 only effect is potential to introduce bugs.


* sg/travis-build-during-script-phase (2018-01-08) 1 commit
 - travis-ci: build Git during the 'script' phase

 So... what do we want to do with this thing?


* jh/status-no-ahead-behind (2018-01-24) 4 commits
 - status: support --no-ahead-behind in long format
 - status: update short status to respect --no-ahead-behind
 - status: add --[no-]ahead-behind to status and commit for V2 format.
 - stat_tracking_info: return +1 when branches not equal

 "git status" can spend a lot of cycles to compute the relation
 between the current branch and its upstream, which can now be
 disabled with "--no-ahead-behind" option.

 At v5; is this ready for 'next'?


* av/fsmonitor-updates (2018-01-04) 6 commits
 - fsmonitor: use fsmonitor data in `git diff`
 - fsmonitor: remove debugging lines from t/t7519-status-fsmonitor.sh
 - fsmonitor: make output of test-dump-fsmonitor more concise
 - fsmonitor: update helper tool, now that flags are filled later
 - fsmonitor: stop inline'ing mark_fsmonitor_valid / _invalid
 - dir.c: update comments to match argument name

 Code clean-up on fsmonitor integration, plus optional utilization
 of the fsmonitor data in diff-files.

 Waiting for an update.
 cf. <alpine.DEB.2.21.1.1801042335130.32@MININT-6BKU6QN.europe.corp.microsoft.com>


* pb/bisect-helper-2 (2017-10-28) 8 commits
 - t6030: make various test to pass GETTEXT_POISON tests
 - bisect--helper: `bisect_start` shell function partially in C
 - bisect--helper: `get_terms` & `bisect_terms` shell function in C
 - bisect--helper: `bisect_next_check` shell function in C
 - bisect--helper: `check_and_set_terms` shell function in C
 - wrapper: move is_empty_file() and rename it as is_empty_or_missing_file()
 - bisect--helper: `bisect_write` shell function in C
 - bisect--helper: `bisect_reset` shell function in C

 Expecting a reroll.

* dj/runtime-prefix (2017-12-05) 4 commits
 . exec_cmd: RUNTIME_PREFIX on some POSIX systems
 . Makefile: add Perl runtime prefix support
 . Makefile: add support for "perllibdir"
 . Makefile: generate Perl header from template file

 A build-time option has been added to allow Git to be told to refer
 to its associated files relative to the main binary, in the same
 way that has been possible on Windows for quite some time, for
 Linux, BSDs and Darwin.

 Tentatively kicked out of 'next' to see how well another topic
 ab/simplify-perl-makefile that heavily conflicts with this fares.


* mk/http-backend-content-length (2017-11-27) 4 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - t5560-http-backend-noserver.sh: add CONTENT_LENGTH cases
 - SQUASH???
 - http-backend: respect CONTENT_LENGTH as specified by rfc3875

 The http-backend (used for smart-http transport) used to slurp the
 whole input until EOF, without paying attention to CONTENT_LENGTH
 that is supplied in the environment and instead expecting the Web
 server to close the input stream.  This has been fixed.

 Expecting a reroll.
 Suggested fixes to be used when rerolling is queued, but I'd
 prefer _not_ squashing them myself.

 Also, it may be too complex solution for the problem.
 cf. <20171204171308.GA13332@sigill.intra.peff.net>


* cc/require-tcl-tk-for-build (2017-11-29) 2 commits
 - travis-ci: avoid new tcl/tk build requirement
 - Makefile: check that tcl/tk is installed

 A first-time builder of Git may have installed neither tclsh nor
 msgfmt, in which case git-gui and gitk part will fail and break the
 build.  As a workaround, refuse to run a build when tclsh is not
 installed and NO_TCLTK is not set.

 Undecided.
 I still feel that requring tclsh to be installed, with or without
 "escape hatch" for experts, may be too heavy-handed.


* mg/merge-base-fork-point (2017-09-17) 3 commits
 - merge-base: find fork-point outside partial reflog
 - merge-base: return fork-point outside reflog
 - t6010: test actual test output

 "merge-base --fork-point $branch $commit" is used to guess on which
 commit among the commits that were once at the tip of the $branch the
 $commit was built on top of, and it learns these historical tips from
 the reflog of the $branch.  When the true fork-point is lost due to
 pruning of old reflog entries, the command does not give any output,
 because it has no way to guess correctly and does not want to mislead
 the user with a wrong guess.

 The command has been updated to give the best but not known to be
 correct guess, based on a hope that a merge-base between $commit and a
 virtual merge across all the reflog entries that still are available
 for $branch may still be a closer to the true fork-point than the
 merge-base between $commit and the current tip of the $branch.

 This may have to be offered by an additional option, to allow the
 users that are prepared to see a potentially incorrect guess to opt
 into the feature, without affecting the current callers that may not
 be prepared to accept a guess that is not known to be correct.

 What's the doneness of this one?


* jk/drop-ancient-curl (2017-08-09) 5 commits
 - http: #error on too-old curl
 - curl: remove ifdef'd code never used with curl >=7.19.4
 - http: drop support for curl < 7.19.4
 - http: drop support for curl < 7.16.0
 - http: drop support for curl < 7.11.1

 Some code in http.c that has bitrot is being removed.

 Expecting a reroll.


* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2017-08-10) 1 commit
 . zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

 Needs resurrecting by making sure the fix is good and still applies
 (or adjusted to today's codebase).


* mg/status-in-progress-info (2017-05-10) 2 commits
 - status --short --inprogress: spell it as --in-progress
 - status: show in-progress info for short status

 "git status" learns an option to report various operations
 (e.g. "merging") that the user is in the middle of.

* bp/name-hash-dirname-fix (2018-02-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-14 at 2f564fb4b3)
 + name-hash: properly fold directory names in adjust_dirname_case()

 "git add" files in the same directory, but spelling the directory
 path in different cases on case insensitive filesystem, corrupted
 the name hash data structure and led to unexpected results.  This
 has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 "git rebase -p" mangled log messages of a merge commit, which is
 now fixed.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* js/packet-read-line-check-null (2018-02-08) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-14 at 6ba237b284)
 + always check for NULL return from packet_read_line()
 + correct error messages for NULL packet_read_line()

 Some low level protocol codepath could crash when they get an
 unexpected flush packet, which is now fixed.

 Will merge to 'master'.

* ma/config-page-only-in-list-mode (2018-02-21) 3 commits
 - config: change default of `pager.config` to "on"
 - config: respect `pager.config` in list/get-mode only
 - t7006: add tests for how git config paginates

 In a way similar to how "git tag" learned to honor the pager
 setting only in the list mode, "git config" learned to ignore the
 pager setting when it is used for setting values (i.e. when the
 purpose of the operation is not to "show").

 Waiting for discussion to conclude.

* pw/add-p-recount (2018-02-20) 9 commits
 - add -p: don't rely on apply's '--recount' option

 - add -p: adjust offsets of subsequent hunks when one is skipped
 - t3701: add failing test for pathological context lines
 - t3701: don't hard code sha1 hash values
 - t3701: use test_write_lines and write_script
 - t3701: indent here documents
 - add -i: add function to format hunk header

 "git add -p" has been lazy in coalescing split patches before
 passing the result to underlying "git apply", leading to corner
 case bugs; the logic to prepare the patch to be applied after hunk
 selections has been tightened.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* pw/add-p-single (2018-02-13) 3 commits
 - add -p: improve error messages
 - add -p: only bind search key if there's more than one hunk
 - add -p: only display help for active keys

 "git add -p" used to offer "/" (look for a matching hunk) as a
 choice, even there was only one hunk, which has been corrected.
 Also the single-key help is now given only for keys that are
 enabled (e.g. help for '/' won't be shown when there is only one
 hunk).

 Rename detection logic in "diff" family that is used in "merge" has
 learned to guess when all of x/a, x/b and x/c have moved to z/a,
 z/b and z/c, it is likely that x/d added in the meantime would also
 want to move to z/d by taking the hint that the entire directory
 'x' moved to 'z'.  A bug causing dirty files involved in a rename
 to be overwritten during merge has also been fixed as part of this
 work.

 Will merge to 'next'.
