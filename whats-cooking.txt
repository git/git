What's cooking in git.git (Jul 2019, #07; Mon, 29)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

The first preview for 2.23 has been tagged.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* bb/grep-pcre2-bug-message-fix (2019-07-23) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-07-23 at 8bd5a68618)
 + grep: print the pcre2_jit_on value

 BUG() message fix.

 The codepath may want to just simply be removed, though.


* jk/xdiff-clamp-funcname-context-index (2019-07-23) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-07-25 at b2944a0ba6)
 + xdiff: clamp function context indices in post-image

 The internal diff machinery can be made to read out of bounds while
 looking for --funcion-context line in a corner case, which has been
 corrected.


* js/rebase-cleanup (2019-07-25) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-07-25 at 3d9cedf470)
 + git: mark cmd_rebase as requiring a worktree
 + rebase: fix white-space

 A few leftover cleanup to "git rebase" in C.


* sg/travis-gcc-4.8 (2019-07-19) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-07-25 at e3d546eb15)
 + travis-ci: build with GCC 4.8 as well

 Add a job to build with a tad older GCC to make sure we are still
 buildable.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* nd/index-dump-in-json (2019-06-26) 11 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - t3008: use the new SINGLE_CPU prereq
 - read-cache.c: dump "IEOT" extension as json
 - read-cache.c: dump "EOIE" extension as json
 - resolve-undo.c: dump "REUC" extension as json
 - fsmonitor.c: dump "FSMN" extension as json
 - split-index.c: dump "link" extension as json
 - dir.c: dump "UNTR" extension as json
 - cache-tree.c: dump "TREE" extension as json
 - read-cache.c: dump common extension info in json
 - ls-files: add --json to dump the index

 "ls-files" learned "--debug-json" option to dump the contents and
 the extensions of the index file.

 At least the fixup at the tip needs to be squashed into the right
 commit.  Also the new test seems flaky.


* jn/unknown-index-extensions (2018-11-21) 2 commits
 - index: offer advice for unknown index extensions
 - index: do not warn about unrecognized extensions

 A bit too alarming warning given when unknown index extensions
 exist is getting revamped.

 Expecting a reroll.


* jc/format-patch-delay-message-id (2019-04-05) 1 commit
 - format-patch: move message-id and related headers to the end

 The location "git format-patch --thread" adds the Message-Id:
 header in the series of header fields has been moved down, which
 may help working around a suspected bug in GMail MSA, reported at
 <CAHk-=whP1stFZNAaJiMi5eZ9rj0MRt20Y_yHVczZPH+O01d+sA@mail.gmail.com>

 Waiting for feedback to see if it truly helps.
 Needs tests.


* jt/fetch-cdn-offload (2019-03-12) 9 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - upload-pack: send part of packfile response as uri
 - fetch-pack: support more than one pack lockfile
 - upload-pack: refactor reading of pack-objects out
 - Documentation: add Packfile URIs design doc
 - Documentation: order protocol v2 sections
 - http-fetch: support fetching packfiles by URL
 - http: improve documentation of http_pack_request
 - http: use --stdin when getting dumb HTTP pack

 WIP for allowing a response to "git fetch" to instruct the bulk of
 the pack contents to be instead taken from elsewhere (aka CDN).


* js/protocol-advertise-multi (2018-12-28) 1 commit
 - protocol: advertise multiple supported versions

 The transport layer has been updated so that the protocol version
 used can be negotiated between the parties, by the initiator
 listing the protocol versions it is willing to talk, and the other
 side choosing from one of them.

 Expecting a reroll.
 cf. <CANq=j3u-zdb_FvNJGPCmygNMScseav63GhVvBX3NcVS4f7TejA@mail.gmail.com>


* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2018-10-15) 1 commit
 - zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".


* dl/remote-save-to-push (2018-12-11) 1 commit
 - remote: add --save-to-push option to git remote set-url

 "git remote set-url" learned a new option that moves existing value
 of the URL field to pushURL field of the remote before replacing
 the URL field with a new value.

 Anybody who wants to champion this topic?
 I am personally not yet quite convinced if this is worth pursuing.

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* vn/reset-deleted-ita (2019-07-26) 1 commit
 - reset: unstage empty deleted ita files

 "git reset HEAD [<pathspec>]" did not reset an empty file that was
 added with the intent-to-add bit.

 Expecting a reroll.


* cb/xdiff-no-system-includes-in-dot-c (2019-07-28) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-07-29 at 35ea0d8cba)
 + xdiff: remove duplicate headers from xpatience.c
 + xdiff: remove duplicate headers from xhistogram.c
 + xdiff: drop system includes in xutils.c
 (this branch uses jk/no-system-includes-in-dot-c.)

 Compilation fix.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/no-system-includes-in-dot-c (2019-06-19) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-07-29 at 8081b8c13d)
 + wt-status.h: drop stdio.h include
 + verify-tag: drop signal.h include
 (this branch is used by cb/xdiff-no-system-includes-in-dot-c.)

 Compilation fix.

 Will merge to 'master'.

* ra/rebase-i-more-options (2019-07-23) 4 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - rebase -i: support --committer-date-is-author-date
 - sequencer: add NULL checks under read_author_script
 - rebase -i: add --ignore-whitespace flag

 "git rebase -i" learned a few options that are known by "git
 rebase" proper.

 Needs a bit of fixups, at least.


* js/rebase-r-strategy (2019-07-25) 12 commits
 - rebase -r: do not (re-)generate root commits with `--root` *and* `--onto`
 - t3418: test `rebase -r` with merge strategies
 - t/lib-rebase: prepare for testing `git rebase --rebase-merges`
 - rebase -r: support merge strategies other than `recursive`
 - t3427: mark two test cases as requiring support for `git rebase -p`
 - t3427: fix another incorrect assumption
 - t3427: accommodate for the `rebase --merge` backend having been replaced
 - t3427: fix erroneous assumption
 - t3427: condense the unnecessarily repetitive test cases into three
 - t3427: move the `filter-branch` invocation into the `setup` case
 - t3427: simplify the `setup` test case significantly
 - t3427: add a clarifying comment

 "git rebase --rebase-merges" learned to drive different merge
 strategies and pass strategy specific options to them.


* js/trace2-json-schema (2019-07-25) 3 commits
 . ci: run trace2 schema validation in the CI suite
 . trace2: add a schema validator for trace2 events
 . trace2: add a JSON schema for trace2 events

 The JSON output produced by "trace2" subsystem now has JSON schema
 defined on it, to allow us validate the output and catch deviation.

 The CI integration may be a bit too heavy-handed.


* js/builtin-add-i (2019-07-18) 11 commits
 - built-in add -i: implement the `help` command
 - built-in add -i: use color in the main loop
 - built-in add -i: support `?` (prompt help)

 - Add a function to determine unique prefixes for a list of strings
 - built-in add -i: implement the main loop
 - built-in add -i: color the header in the `status` command
 - built-in add -i: refresh the index before running `status`
 - built-in add -i: implement the `status` command
 - diff: export diffstat interface
 - Start to implement a built-in version of `git add --interactive`

 The beginning of rewriting "git add -i" in C.


* js/visual-studio (2019-07-29) 23 commits
 - git: avoid calling aliased builtins via their dashed form
 - bin-wrappers: append `.exe` to target paths if necessary
 - .gitignore: ignore Visual Studio's temporary/generated files
 - .gitignore: touch up the entries regarding Visual Studio

 - contrib/buildsystems: also handle -lexpat
 - contrib/buildsystems: handle libiconv, too
 - contrib/buildsystems: handle the curl library option
 - contrib/buildsystems: error out on unknown option
 - contrib/buildsystems: optionally capture the dry-run in a file
 - contrib/buildsystems: redirect errors of the dry run into a log file
 - contrib/buildsystems: ignore gettext stuff
 - contrib/buildsystems: handle quoted spaces in filenames
 - contrib/buildsystems: fix misleading error message
 - contrib/buildsystems: ignore irrelevant files in Generators/
 - contrib/buildsystems: ignore invalidcontinue.obj
 - Vcproj.pm: urlencode '<' and '>' when generating VC projects
 - Vcproj.pm: do not configure VCWebServiceProxyGeneratorTool
 - Vcproj.pm: list git.exe first to be startup project
 - Vcproj.pm: auto-generate GUIDs

 Support building Git with Visual Studio

 The bits about .git/branches/* have been dropped from the series.
 We may want to drop the support for it, but until that happens, the
 tests should rely on the existence of the support to pass.


* bc/hash-independent-tests-part-4 (2019-07-01) 10 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-07-29 at d1efaea0ec)

 + t5000: make hash independent
 + t1450: make hash size independent
 + t1410: make hash size independent
 + t: add helper to convert object IDs to paths

 Update to the tests to help SHA-256 transition continues.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* es/walken-tutorial (2019-07-02) 1 commit
 - documentation: add tutorial for revision walking

 Yet another revision walker tutorial.


* ds/early-access (2019-07-01) 3 commits
 - repo-settings: pack.useSparse=true
 - repo-settings: use index.version=4 by default
 - repo-settings: create core.featureAdoptionRate setting

 A mechanism to enable newish configuration settings in bulk has
 been invented.

 Will replace with a redesigned variant which is being discussed
 when the dust settles.
 cf. <pull.292.v2.git.gitgitgadget@gmail.com> (v2)


* ab/no-kwset (2019-07-01) 10 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-07-15 at ed0479ce3d)
 + grep: use PCRE v2 for optimized fixed-string search
 + grep: remove the kwset optimization
 + grep: drop support for \0 in --fixed-strings <pattern>
 + grep: make the behavior for NUL-byte in patterns sane

 + t4210: skip more command-line encoding tests on MinGW
 + grep: don't use PCRE2?_UTF8 with "log --encoding=<non-utf8>"
 + log tests: test regex backends in "--encode=<enc>" tests
 (this branch is used by ab/pcre-jit-fixes.)

 Retire use of kwset library, which is an optimization for looking
 for fixed strings, with use of pcre2 JIT.

 Kicked out of 'next' to give the topic a chance to get rebooted.


* ab/pcre-jit-fixes (2019-07-26) 7 commits
 - grep: do not enter PCRE2_UTF mode on fixed matching
 - grep: stess test PCRE v2 on invalid UTF-8 data
 - grep: create a "is_fixed" member in "grep_pat"
 - grep: consistently use "p->fixed" in compile_regexp()

 - grep: stop "using" a custom JIT stack with PCRE v2
 - grep: remove overly paranoid BUG(...) code
 (this branch uses ab/no-kwset.)

 A few simplification and bugfixes to PCRE interface.

 Teach the lazy clone machinery that there can be more than one
 promisor remote and consult them in order when downloading missing
 objects on demand.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jc/format-patch-noclobber (2019-02-22) 1 commit
 - format-patch: --no-clobber refrains from overwriting output files

 "git format-patch" used to overwrite an existing patch/cover-letter
 file.  A new "--no-clobber" option stops it.

 Will discard.


* dl/rebase-i-keep-base (2019-04-25) 6 commits
 - rebase: teach rebase --keep-base
 - rebase: fast-forward --fork-point in more cases
 - rebase: fast-forward --onto in more cases
 - rebase: refactor can_fast_forward into goto tower
 - t3432: test rebase fast-forward behavior
 - t3431: add rebase --fork-point tests

 "git rebase --keep-base <upstream>" tries to find the original base
 of the topic being rebased and rebase on top of that same base,
 which is useful when running the "git rebase -i" (and its limited
 variant "git rebase -x").

 The command also has learned to fast-forward in more cases where it
 can instead of replaying to recreate identical commits.

 On hold.
