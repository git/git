What's cooking in git.git (Jun 2024, #01; Mon, 3)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and
aren't considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL
to a message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity (of course they can be resubmit when new interests
arise).

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-scm/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/

* ps/fix-reinit-includeif-onbranch (2024-05-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2024-05-25 at 89c035186d)
 + setup: fix bug with "includeIf.onbranch" when initializing dir

 "git init" in an already created directory, when the user
 configuration has includeif.onbranch, started to fail recently,
 which has been corrected.

  (merged to 'next' on 2024-05-25 at 520b6b2897)
 + push: don't fetch commit object when checking existence

 When "git push" notices that the commit at the tip of the ref on
 the other side it is about to overwrite does not exist locally, it
 used to first try fetching it if the local repository is a partial
 clone. The command has been taught not to do so and immediately
 fail instead.

* cc/upload-pack-missing-action (2024-05-24) 3 commits
 - upload-pack: allow configuring a missing-action
 - pack-objects: use the missing action API
 - rev-list: refactor --missing=<missing-action>

 Allow a server S that is a lazy clone of another repository X to
 respond to a request by C that is a lazy clone of S in a way that
 it omits objects it itself does not have (and has to be lazily
 fetched from X).

 I would say this is a terribly irresponsive design, especially
 there is no negociation for S to learn if the objects it is going
 to omit is obtainable by C from elsewhere.
