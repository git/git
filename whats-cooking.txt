What's cooking in git.git (Jun 2022, #02; Tue, 7)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen',
and aren't considered "accepted" at all.

This cycle will complete at around the end of June
(https://tinyurl.com/gitCal); we are in the week #7 of the cycle.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/

 platter.

 termination of the waited child, which was incorrect.

* cb/path-owner-check-with-sudo-plus (2022-05-12) 1 commit
 - git-compat-util: allow root to access both SUDO_UID and root owned

 "sudo git foo" used to consider a repository owned by the original
 user a safe one to access; it now also considers a repository owned
 by root a safe one, too (after all, if an attacker can craft a
 malicious repository owned by root, the box is 0wned already).

 What's our take on this one?  IIRC, the last time we discussed,
 Carlo was hesitant to push this step forward?

 - hook API: fix v2.36.0 regression: hooks should be connected to a TTY
 - run-command: add an "ungroup" option to run_process_parallel()

 In Git 2.36 we revamped the way how hooks are invoked.  One change
 that is end-user visible is that the output of a hook is no longer
 directly connected to the standard output of "git" that spawns the
 hook, which was noticed post release.  This is getting corrected.
