What's cooking in git.git (May 2013, #08; Tue, 28)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.

There are topics that are still in 'next', not because they needed
more testing, but only because we already were in the -rc period.
Now that 1.8.3 is out, we will start merging them to 'master' (and
some to 'maint' for 1.8.3.1) probably tomorrow (after waiting for a
few days to make sure we can have a clean start of the post 1.8.3
maint branch with brown paper bag fixes and nothing else).

The post 1.8.3 cycle will start early next month, at which time the
'next' branch will be rewound and rebuilt.  Until then, I expect
that my patch queue may stay slow and leaky while I take a bit of
break.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* nd/urls-doc-no-file-hyperlink-fix (2013-05-24) 1 commit
 - urls.txt: avoid auto converting to hyperlink

 Will merge to 'next'.


* cb/log-follow-with-combined (2013-05-28) 1 commit
 - fix segfault with git log -c --follow

 Will merge to 'next'.


* fc/cleanups (2013-05-28) 3 commits
 - test: rebase: fix --interactive test
 - test: trivial cleanups
 - remote: trivial style cleanup

 Will merge to 'next'.


* fc/makefile (2013-05-26) 5 commits
 - build: do not install git-remote-testpy
 - build: add NO_INSTALL variable
 - build: cleanup using $<
 - build: cleanup using $^
 - build: trivial simplification
 (this branch is used by fc/remote-helpers-use-specified-python.)

 Will merge to 'next'.


* fc/remote-helpers-use-specified-python (2013-05-28) 4 commits
 - remote-helpers: add exec-path links
 - remote-helpers: allow direct test execution
 - remote-helpers: rename tests
 - remote-helpers: generate scripts
 (this branch uses fc/makefile.)

 I do not particularly think the second from the bottom is a good
 change, but it takes the remainder of the series hostage.
 Will hopefully be rerolled without it.


* fc/send-email-chainreplyto-warning (2013-05-28) 1 commit
 - send-email: remove warning about unset chainreplyto

 An overdue removal od "behaviour changed at 1.7.0; if you were
 living in a cave, here is what you can adjust to it" message.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ks/difftool-dirdiff-copy-all (2013-05-28) 1 commit
 - difftool --dir-diff: always use identical working tree file

 "difftool --dir-diff" populates a temporary directory with files,
 inviting the user to modify them in place, but in some cases we
 weren't expecting the user to modify them and did not take the
 change back to the working tree.

 The log message has room for clarification, but the change looked
 sane.


* nd/prune-packed-dryrun-verbose (2013-05-28) 1 commit
 - prune-packed: avoid implying "1" is DRY_RUN in prune_packed_objects()

 Will merge to 'next'.


* rj/mingw-compat-st-mode-bits (2013-05-28) 1 commit
 - path: Fix a sparse warning

 Will merge to 'next'.


* rs/commit-m-no-edit (2013-05-28) 1 commit
 - commit: don't start editor if empty message is given with -m

 Will merge to 'next'.


* xq/credential-osxkeychain (2013-05-28) 1 commit
 - credential-osxkeychain: support more protocols

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jc/core-checkstat (2013-05-06) 1 commit
 - deprecate core.statinfo at Git 2.0 boundary
 (this branch is used by jc/core-checkstat-2.0.)

 Will merge to 'next'.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* rr/rebase-autostash (2013-05-12) 7 commits
 - rebase: implement --[no-]autostash and rebase.autostash
 - rebase --merge: return control to caller, for housekeeping
 - rebase -i: return control to caller, for housekeeping
 - am: return control to caller, for housekeeping
 - rebase: prepare to do generic housekeeping
 - rebase -i: don't error out if $state_dir already exists
 - am: tighten a conditional that checks for $dotest

 This is from v3, but after a "Fixed" message in $gmane/224111 we
 haven't seen a reroll yet.  Also there was an attempt for a
 follow-up, but it was never completed.


* rj/mingw-cygwin (2013-05-08) 2 commits
 - cygwin: Remove the CYGWIN_V15_WIN32API build variable
 - mingw: rename WIN32 cpp macro to GIT_WINDOWS_NATIVE

 Update build for Cygwin 1.[57].  There seems to have been some
 discussion but did anything concrete come out of it???


* mh/multimail (2013-04-21) 1 commit
 - git-multimail: a replacement for post-receive-email

 Waiting for the initial history to pull from.
 $gmane/223564


* jc/format-patch (2013-04-22) 2 commits
 - format-patch: --inline-single
 - format-patch: rename "no_inline" field

 A new option to send a single patch to the standard output to be
 appended at the bottom of a message.  I personally have no need for
 this, but it was easy enough to cobble together.  Tests, docs and
 stripping out more MIMEy stuff are left as exercises to interested
 parties.

 Not ready for inclusion.


* jk/gitweb-utf8 (2013-04-08) 4 commits
 - gitweb: Fix broken blob action parameters on blob/commitdiff pages
 - gitweb: Don't append ';js=(0|1)' to external links
 - gitweb: Make feed title valid utf8
 - gitweb: Fix utf8 encoding for blob_plain, blobdiff_plain, commitdiff_plain, and patch

 Various fixes to gitweb.

 Waiting for a reroll after a review.


* jk/commit-info-slab (2013-04-19) 3 commits
 - commit-slab: introduce a macro to define a slab for new type
 - commit-slab: avoid large realloc
 - commit: allow associating auxiliary info on-demand
 (this branch is used by jc/show-branch.)

 Technology demonstration to show a way we could use unbound number
 of flag bits on commit objects.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jn/config-ignore-inaccessible (2013-04-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-05-07 at 4f09e24)
 + config: allow inaccessible configuration under $HOME

 When $HOME is misconfigured to point at an unreadable directory, we
 used to complain and die. This loosens the check.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 - fetch: make own copies of refnames
 - describe: make own copy of refname

 Define memory ownership and lifetime rules for what for-each-ref
 feeds to its callbacks (in short, "you do not own it, so make a
 copy if you want to keep it").


* th/bisect-skip-report-range-fix (2013-05-22) 1 commit
 - bisect: Fix log output for multi-parent skip ranges

 Fix for an additional bisect log comments.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* mm/mediawiki-https-fail-message (2013-05-23) 1 commit
 - git-remote-mediawiki: better error message when HTTP(S) access fails

 Hint users when https:// connection failed to check the
 certificate; it is a good hint if we assumie that it is common
 error for the end users to make.

 Still under discussion.
 $gmane/225678


* tg/maint-zsh-svn-remote-prompt (2013-05-22) 1 commit
 - prompt: fix show upstream with svn and zsh

 zsh prompt script that borrowed from bash prompt script did not
 work due to slight differences in array variable notation between
 these two shells.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* tr/push-no-verify-doc (2013-05-23) 1 commit
 - Document push --no-verify

 "git push --[no-]verify" was not documented.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* dm/unbash-subtree (2013-05-21) 1 commit
 - contrib/git-subtree: Use /bin/sh interpreter instead of /bin/bash

 It turns out that git-subtree script does not have to be run with
 bash.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* fc/transport-helper-no-refspec (2013-05-21) 2 commits
 - transport-helper: check if the dry-run is supported
 - transport-helper: barf when user tries old:new

 With "export" remote-helper protocol, (1) a push that tries to
 update a remote ref whose name is different from the pushing side
 does not work yet, and (2) the helper may not know how to do
 --dry-run, so detect such problematic cases and disable them for
 now.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* rr/die-on-missing-upstream (2013-05-22) 2 commits
 - sha1_name: fix error message for @{<N>}, @{<date>}
 - sha1_name: fix error message for @{u}

 When a reflog notation is used for implicit "current branch", we
 did not say which branch and worse said "branch ''".

 Waiting for series of rerolls to settle.


* jc/show-branch (2013-05-21) 5 commits
 - show-branch: use commit slab to represent bitflags of arbitrary width
 - show-branch.c: remove "all_mask"
 - show-branch.c: abstract out "flags" operation
 - show-branch.c: lift all_mask/all_revs to a global static
 - show-branch.c: update comment style
 (this branch uses jk/commit-info-slab.)

 Waiting for the final step to lift the hard-limit before sending it out.


* fc/remote-bzr (2013-05-28) 8 commits
 - remote-bzr: add fallback check for a partial clone
 - remote-bzr: reorganize the way 'wanted' works
 - remote-bzr: trivial cleanups
 - remote-bzr: change global repo
 - remote-bzr: delay cloning/pulling
 - remote-bzr: simplify get_remote_branch()
 - remote-bzr: fix for files with spaces
 - remote-bzr: recover from failed clones

 The ones near the tip conflicted with the hotfix for 1.8.3 so I
 discarded them for now.

 Will merge to 'next'?

 Allows N instances of tests run in parallel, each running 1/N parts
 of the test suite under Valgrind, to speed things up.

 The tip one may be useful in practice but is a tad ugly ;-)
 Will merge to 'next'.

 Will merge to 'master'.

  (merged to 'next' on 2013-05-21 at 0497edb)
 + imap-send: eliminate HMAC deprecation warnings on Mac OS X
 + cache.h: eliminate SHA-1 deprecation warnings on Mac OS X
 + Makefile: add support for Apple CommonCrypto facility
 + Makefile: fix default regex settings on Darwin

 Newer MacOS X encourages the programs to compile and link with
 their CommonCrypto, not with OpenSSL.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* fc/macos-x-clipped-write (2013-05-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-05-21 at 510b0dd)
 + compate/clipped-write.c: large write(2) fails on Mac OS X/XNU

 Mac OS X does not like to write(2) more than INT_MAX number of
 bytes.

* jc/t5551-posix-sed-bre (2013-05-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-05-21 at d597ca1)
 + t5551: do not use unportable sed '\+'

 POSIX fix for a test script.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/fetch-always-update-tracking (2013-05-28) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-05-28 at c6abf3f)
 + fetch: don't try to update unfetched tracking refs
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-05-21 at f7e4b16)
 + fetch: opportunistically update tracking refs
 + refactor "ref->merge" flag
 + fetch/pull doc: untangle meaning of bare <ref>
 + t5510: start tracking-ref tests from a known state

 "git fetch origin master" unlike "git fetch origin" or "git fetch"
 does not update "refs/remotes/origin/master" and it was an early
 design decision to keep the update of remote tracking branches
 predictable, but in practice it turns out that people find it more
 convenient to opportunisticly update them whenever we have a
 chance, and we have been updating them when we run "git push" which
 already breaks the original "predictability" anyway.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* nd/clone-connectivity-shortcut (2013-05-28) 4 commits
 - clone: open a shortcut for connectivity check
 - index-pack: remove dead code (it should never happen)
 - fetch-pack: prepare updated shallow file before fetching the pack
 - clone: let the user know when check_everything_connected is run

 Will merge to 'next'.


* kb/ancestry-path-threedots (2013-05-16) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-05-21 at 5d75bd3)
 + revision.c: treat A...B merge bases as if manually specified
 + t6019: demonstrate --ancestry-path A...B breakage
 (this branch is used by kb/full-history-compute-treesame-carefully-2.)

 "git log --ancestry-path A...B" did not work as expected, as it did
 not pay attention to the fact that the merge base between A and B
 was the bottom of the range being specified.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* kb/full-history-compute-treesame-carefully-2 (2013-05-16) 15 commits
 - revision.c: make default history consider bottom commits
 - revision.c: don't show all merges for --parents
 - revision.c: discount side branches when computing TREESAME

 - simplify-merges: drop merge from irrelevant side branch
 - simplify-merges: never remove all TREESAME parents
 - t6012: update test for tweaked full-history traversal

 - decorate.c: compact table when growing
 (this branch uses kb/ancestry-path-threedots.)

 Major update to a very core part of the system to improve culling
 of irrelevant parents while traversing a mergy history.

 Will not be a 1.8.3 material, but is an important topic.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jc/strbuf-branchname-fix (2013-05-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-05-21 at 5db8872)
 + strbuf_branchname(): do not double-expand @{-1}~22

 "git merge @{-1}~22" was rewritten to "git merge frotz@{1}~22"
 incorrectly when your previous branch was "frotz" (it should be
 rewritten to "git merge frotz~22" instead).

 Will merge to 'master'.


* mk/combine-diff-context-horizon-fix (2013-05-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-05-21 at f462c02)
 + combine-diff.c: Fix output when changes are exactly 3 lines apart

 "git diff -c -p" was not showing a deleted line from a hunk when
 another hunk immediately begins where the earlier one ends.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* mm/color-auto-default (2013-05-15) 2 commits
 - make color.ui default to 'auto'
 - config: refactor management of color.ui's default value

 Flip the default for color.ui to 'auto', which is what many
 tutorials recommend new users to do.  The updated code claims the
 switch happened at Git 2.0 in the past tense, but we might want to
 expedite it, as this change is not all that important to deserve a
 major version bump.

 I'd vote for merging this without waiting for 2.0.  Comments?
 Waiting for a reroll.


* tr/coverage (2013-05-13) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-05-21 at 8480007)
 + coverage: build coverage-untested-functions by default
 + coverage: set DEFAULT_TEST_TARGET to avoid using prove
 + coverage: do not delete .gcno files before building
 + coverage: split build target into compile and test

 Update the test coverage support that was left to bitrot for some
 time.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* mg/more-textconv (2013-05-10) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-05-21 at 701cdb7)
 + grep: honor --textconv for the case rev:path
 + grep: allow to use textconv filters
 + t7008: demonstrate behavior of grep with textconv
 + cat-file: do not die on --textconv without textconv filters
 + show: honor --textconv for blobs
 + diff_opt: track whether flags have been set explicitly
 + t4030: demonstrate behavior of show with textconv

 Make "git grep" and "git show" pay attention to --textconv when
 dealing with blob objects.

 I thought this was pretty well designed and executed, but it seems
 there are some doubts on the list.


* jh/shorten-refname (2013-05-07) 4 commits
 - t1514: refname shortening is done after dereferencing symbolic refs
 - shorten_unambiguous_ref(): Fix shortening refs/remotes/origin/HEAD to origin
 - t1514: Demonstrate failure to correctly shorten "refs/remotes/origin/HEAD"
 - t1514: Add tests of shortening refnames in strict/loose mode

 When remotes/origin/HEAD is not a symbolic ref, "rev-parse
 --abbrev-ref remotes/origin/HEAD" ought to show "origin", not
 "origin/HEAD", which is fixed with this series (if it is a symbolic
 ref that points at remotes/origin/something, then it should show
 "origin/something" and it already does).

 Expecting a reroll, as an early part of a larger series.


* nd/clone-local-with-colon (2013-05-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-05-21 at 3e293bd)
 + clone: allow cloning local paths with colons in them

 "git clone foo/bar:baz" cannot be a request to clone from a remote
 over git-over-ssh specified in the scp style.  Detect this case and
 clone from a local repository at "foo/bar:baz".

 Will merge to 'master'.


* nd/warn-ambiguous-object-name (2013-05-07) 1 commit
 - get_sha1: improve ambiguity warning regarding SHA-1 and ref names

 "git cmd <name>", when <name> happens to be a 40-hex string,
 directly uses the 40-hex string as an object name, even if a ref
 "refs/<some hierarchy>/<name>" exists.  This disambiguation order
 is unlikely to change, but we should warn about the ambiguity just
 like we warn when more than one refs/ hierachies share the same
 name.

 Will be rerolled.

 + fast-export: don't parse commits while reading marks file
 + fast-export: do not parse non-commit objects while reading marks file

 Optimization for fast-export by avoiding unnecessarily resolving
 arbitrary object name and parsing object when only presence and
 type information is necessary, etc.

  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-22 at 2356700)
 + glossary: Update and rephrase the definition of a remote-tracking branch
 + branch.c: Validate tracking branches with refspecs instead of refs/remotes/*
 + t9114.2: Don't use --track option against "svn-remote"-tracking branches
 + t7201.24: Add refspec to keep --track working
 + t3200.39: tracking setup should fail if there is no matching refspec.
 + checkout: Use remote refspecs when DWIMming tracking branches
 + t2024: Show failure to use refspec when DWIMming remote branch names
 + t2024: Add tests verifying current DWIM behavior of 'git checkout <branch>'

 Updates "git checkout foo" that DWIMs the intended "upstream" and
 turns it into "git checkout -t -b foo remotes/origin/foo" to
 correctly take existing remote definitions into account.  The
 remote "origin" may be what uniquely map its own branch to
 remotes/some/where/foo but that some/where may not be "origin".

  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-22 at b00ccf6)
 + api-parse-options.txt: document "no-" for non-boolean options
 + git-gc.txt, git-reflog.txt: document new expiry options
 + date.c: add parse_expiry_date()
 (this branch is used by mh/packed-refs-various.)

 We used the approxidate() parser for "--expire=<timestamp>" options
 of various commands, but it is better to treat --expire=all and
 --expire=now a bit more specially than using the current timestamp.
 Update "git gc" and "git reflog" with a new parsing function for
 expiry dates.

 + check-ignore: allow incremental streaming of queries via --stdin
 + check-ignore: move setup into cmd_check_ignore()
 + check-ignore: add -n / --non-matching option
 + t0008: remove duplicated test fixture data

 Enhance "check-ignore" (1.8.2 update) to work more like "check-attr"
 over bidi-pipes.
