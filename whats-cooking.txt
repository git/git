What's cooking in git.git (Jan 2017, #05; Thu, 26)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* js/mingw-hooks-with-exe-suffix (2017-01-26) 1 commit
 - mingw: allow hooks to be .exe files

 Names of the various hook scripts must be spelled exactly, but on
 Windows, an .exe binary must be named with .exe suffix; notice
 $GIT_DIR/hooks/<hookname>.exe as a valid <hookname> hook.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* js/retire-relink (2017-01-25) 2 commits
 - relink: really remove the command
 - relink: retire the command

 Cruft removal.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* js/status-pre-rebase-i (2017-01-26) 1 commit
 - status: be prepared for not-yet-started interactive rebase

 After starting "git rebase -i", which first opens the user's editor
 to edit the series of patches to apply, but before saving the
 contents of that file, "git status" failed to show the current
 state (i.e. you are in an interactive rebase session, but you have
 applied no steps yet) correctly.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ps/urlmatch-wildcard (2017-01-26) 5 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - urlmatch: allow globbing for the URL host part
 - urlmatch: split host and port fields in `struct url_info`
 - urlmatch: enable normalization of URLs with globs
 - mailmap: add Patrick Steinhardt's work address

 The <url> part in "http.<url>.<variable>" configuration variable
 can now be spelled with '*' that serves as wildcard.
 E.g. "http.https://*.example.com.proxy" can be used to specify the
 proxy used for https://a.example.com, https://b.example.com, etc.,
 i.e. any host in the example.com domain.


* rs/absolute-pathdup (2017-01-26) 2 commits
 - use absolute_pathdup()
 - abspath: add absolute_pathdup()

 Code cleanup.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sb/submodule-recursive-absorb (2017-01-26) 3 commits
 - submodule absorbing: fix worktree/gitdir pointers recursively for non-moves
 - cache.h: expose the dying procedure for reading gitlinks
 - setup: add gentle version of resolve_git_dir

 When a submodule "sub", which has another submodule "module" nested
 within it, is "absorbed" into the top-level superproject, the inner
 submodule "module" is left in a strange state.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sb/submodule-update-initial-runs-custom-script (2017-01-26) 1 commit
 - submodule update: run custom update script for initial populating as well

 The user can specify a custom update method that is run when
 "submodule update" updates an already checked out submodule.  This
 was ignored when checking the submodule out for the first time and
 we instead always just checked out the commit that is bound to the
 path in the superproject's index.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sf/putty-w-args (2017-01-26) 3 commits
 - connect: support GIT_SSH_VARIANT and ssh.variant
 - connect: rename tortoiseplink and putty variables
 - connect: handle putty/plink also in GIT_SSH_COMMAND

 The command line options for ssh invocation needs to be tweaked for
 some implementations of SSH (e.g. PuTTY plink wants "-P <port>"
 while OpenSSH wants "-p <port>" to specify port to connect to), and
 the variant was guessed when GIT_SSH environment variable is used
 to specify it.  Extend the guess to the command specified by the
 newer GIT_SSH_COMMAND and also core.sshcommand configuration
 variable, and give an escape hatch for users to deal with
 misdetected cases.

 Expecting a reroll of the last step.

[Stalled]

* jc/diff-b-m (2015-02-23) 5 commits
 . WIPWIP
 . WIP: diff-b-m
 - diffcore-rename: allow easier debugging
 - diffcore-rename.c: add locate_rename_src()
 - diffcore-break: allow debugging

 "git diff -B -M" produced incorrect patch when the postimage of a
 completely rewritten file is similar to the preimage of a removed
 file; such a resulting file must not be expressed as a rename from
 other place.

 The fix in this patch is broken, unfortunately.

 Will discard.

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* sh/grep-tree-obj-tweak-output (2017-01-20) 2 commits
 - grep: use '/' delimiter for paths
 - grep: only add delimiter if there isn't one already

 "git grep", when fed a tree-ish as an input, shows each hit
 prefixed with "<tree-ish>:<path>:<lineno>:".  As <tree-ish> is
 almost always either a commit or a tag that points at a commit, the
 early part of the output "<tree-ish>:<path>" can be used as the
 name of the blob and given to "git show".  When <tree-ish> is a
 tree given in the extended SHA-1 syntax (e.g. "<commit>:", or
 "<commit>:<dir>"), however, this results in a string that does not
 name a blob (e.g. "<commit>::<path>" or "<commit>:<dir>:<path>").
 "git grep" has been taught to be a bit more intelligent about these
 cases and omit a colon (in the former case) or use slash (in the
 latter case) to produce "<commit>:<path>" and
 "<commit>:<dir>/<path>" that can be used as the name of a blob.

 Waiting for the review discussion to settle, followed by a reroll.


* vp/show-ref-verify-head (2017-01-23) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-01-23 at af6dd9d239)
 + show-ref: remove a stale comment
 + show-ref: remove dead `if (verify)' check
 + show-ref: detect dangling refs under --verify as well
 + show-ref: move --quiet handling into show_one()
 + show-ref: allow -d to work with --verify
 + show-ref: accept HEAD with --verify

 "git show-ref HEAD" used with "--verify" because the user is not
 interested in seeing refs/remotes/origin/HEAD, and used with
 "--head" because the user does not want HEAD to be filtered out,
 i.e. "git show-ref --head --verify HEAD", did not work as expected.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* bc/use-asciidoctor-opt (2017-01-26) 9 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - Documentation: implement linkgit macro for Asciidoctor
 - Makefile: add a knob to enable the use of Asciidoctor
 - Documentation: move dblatex arguments into variable
 - Documentation: add XSLT to fix DocBook for Texinfo
 - Documentation: sort sources for gitman.texi
 - Documentation: remove unneeded argument in cat-texi.perl
 - Documentation: modernize cat-texi.perl
 - Documentation: fix warning in cat-texi.perl

 Asciidoctor, an alternative reimplementation of AsciiDoc, still
 needs some changes to work with documents meant to be formatted
 with AsciiDoc.  "make USE_ASCIIDOCTOR=YesPlease" to use it out of
 the box to document our pages is getting closer to reality.


* ls/travis-p4-on-macos (2017-01-23) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-01-23 at 2d51987faa)
 + travis-ci: fix Perforce install on macOS

 Update the definition of the MacOSX test environment used by
 TravisCI.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* rs/qsort-s (2017-01-23) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-01-23 at 7e2813848b)
 + ref-filter: use QSORT_S in ref_array_sort()
 + string-list: use QSORT_S in string_list_sort()
 + perf: add basic sort performance test
 + add QSORT_S
 + compat: add qsort_s()

 A few codepaths had to rely on a global variable when sorting
 elements of an array because sort(3) API does not allow extra data
 to be passed to the comparison function.  Use qsort_s() when
 natively available, and a fallback implementation of it when not,
 to eliminate the need, which is a prerequisite for making the
 codepath reentrant.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/coding-guidelines-update (2017-01-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-01-23 at 8c57afa288)
 + CodingGuidelines: clarify multi-line brace style

 Developer doc update.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 + fsck: lazily load types under --connectivity-only
 + fsck: move typename() printing to its own function
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-01-25 at f3d7d93785)
 + t1450: use "mv -f" within loose object directory
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-01-23 at e8e9b76b84)
 + fsck: check HAS_OBJ more consistently
 + fsck: do not fallback "git fsck <bogus>" to "git fsck"
 + fsck: tighten error-checks of "git fsck <head>"
 + fsck: prepare dummy objects for --connectivity-check
 + fsck: report trees as dangling
 + t1450: clean up sub-objects in duplicate-entry test

 "git fsck --connectivity-check" was not working at all.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* js/exec-path-coverity-workaround (2017-01-09) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-01-23 at bf5dfbf860)
 + git_exec_path: do not return the result of getenv()

 + sequencer: move "else" keyword onto the same line as preceding brace
 + sequencer: avoid unnecessary curly braces

 The sequencer machinery has been further enhanced so that a later
 set of patches can start using it to reimplement "rebase -i".

 Will merge to 'master'.
 I think I've said everything that needs to be said on this topic.


* jk/clear-delta-base-cache-fix (2017-01-19) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-01-23 at 5f4af2b0a5)
 + clear_delta_base_cache(): don't modify hashmap while iterating

 A crashing bug introduced in v2.11 timeframe has been found (it is
 triggerable only in fast-import) and fixed.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/describe-omit-some-refs (2017-01-23) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-01-23 at f8a14b4996)
 + describe: teach describe negative pattern matches
 + describe: teach --match to accept multiple patterns
 + name-rev: add support to exclude refs by pattern match
 + name-rev: extend --refs to accept multiple patterns
 + doc: add documentation for OPT_STRING_LIST

 "git describe" and "git name-rev" have been taught to take more
 than one refname patterns to restrict the set of refs to base their
 naming output on, and also learned to take negative patterns to
 name refs not to be used for naming via their "--exclude" option.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* js/remote-rename-with-half-configured-remote (2017-01-19) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-01-23 at a1b655dbac)
 + remote rename: more carefully determine whether a remote is configured
 + remote rename: demonstrate a bogus "remote exists" bug

 With anticipatory tweaking for remotes defined in ~/.gitconfig
 (e.g. "remote.origin.prune" set to true, even though there may or
 may not actually be "origin" remote defined in a particular Git
 repository), "git remote rename" and other commands misinterpreted
 and behaved as if such a non-existing remote actually existed.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* sb/in-core-index-doc (2017-01-19) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-01-23 at 30224463e8)

* jk/vreport-sanitize (2017-01-11) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-01-18 at 4bbf370981)
 + vreport: sanitize ASCII control chars
 + Revert "vreportf: avoid intermediate buffer"

 An error message with an ASCII control character like '\r' in it
 can alter the message to hide its early part, which is problematic
 when a remote side gives such an error message that the local side
 will relay with a "remote: " prefix.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 - unpack-trees: support super-prefix option
 - t1001: modernize style

 - commit.c: use strchrnul() to scan for one line

 The gitattributes machinery is being taught to work better in a
 multi-threaded environment.

 Expecting a reroll.


* jk/loose-object-fsck (2017-01-15) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-01-23 at 4302ad090d)

 "git fsck" inspects loose objects more carefully now.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* vn/xdiff-func-context (2017-01-15) 1 commit
 - xdiff -W: relax end-of-file function detection

 "git diff -W" has been taught to handle the case where a new
 function is added at the end of the file better.

 Will hold.
 An follow-up change to go back from the line that matches the
 funcline to show comments before the function definition is still
 being discussed.

 - refname_is_safe(): correct docstring
 - files_rename_ref(): tidy up whitespace

 Deletion of a branch "foo/bar" could remove .git/refs/heads/foo
 once there no longer is any other branch whose name begins with
 "foo/", but we didn't do so so far.  Now we do.

 Expecting a reroll.

 - git-p4: fix git-p4.pathEncoding for removed files

 When "git p4" imports changelist that removes paths, it failed to
 convert pathnames when the p4 used encoding different from the one
 used on the Git side.  This has been corrected.

 Will be rerolled.

 + Revert "push: change submodule default to check when submodules exist"
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-12-12 at 1863e05af5)
 + push: change submodule default to check when submodules exist
 + submodule add: extend force flag to add existing repos

 Turn the default of "push.recurseSubmodules" to "check" when
 submodules seem to be in use.

 I'll probably remove the tip-two commits and advance the bottom one
 separately.

 - ref-filter: implement %(if), %(then), and %(else) atoms

 The code to list branches in "git branch" has been consolidated
 with the more generic ref-filter API.

 I think this is almost ready.  Will wait for a few days, squash
 fixes in if needed and merge to 'next'.

 + setup_git_env: avoid blind fall-back to ".git"

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2016-10-26

 This is the endgame of the topic to avoid blindly falling back to
 ".git" when the setup sequence said we are _not_ in Git repository.
 A corner case that happens to work right now may be broken by a
 call to die("BUG").

 Will cook in 'next'.

 + merge: drop 'git merge <message> HEAD <commit>' syntax

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2016-10-11

 Stop supporting "git merge <message> HEAD <commit>" syntax that has
 been deprecated since October 2007, and issues a deprecation
 warning message since v2.5.0.

* jc/bundle (2016-03-03) 6 commits
 . index-pack: --clone-bundle option
 . Merge branch 'jc/index-pack' into jc/bundle
 . bundle v3: the beginning
 . bundle: keep a copy of bundle file name in the in-core bundle header
 . bundle: plug resource leak
 . bundle doc: 'verify' is not about verifying the bundle

 The beginning of "split bundle", which could be one of the
 ingredients to allow "git clone" traffic off of the core server
 network to CDN.

 While I think it would make it easier for people to experiment and
 build on if the topic is merged to 'next', I am at the same time a
 bit reluctant to merge an unproven new topic that introduces a new
 file format, which we may end up having to support til the end of
 time.  It is likely that to support a "prime clone from CDN", it
 would need a lot more than just "these are the heads and the pack
 data is over there", so this may not be sufficient.


* jk/nofollow-attr-ignore (2016-11-02) 5 commits
 . exclude: do not respect symlinks for in-tree .gitignore
 . attr: do not respect symlinks for in-tree .gitattributes
 . exclude: convert "check_index" into a flags field
 . attr: convert "macro_ok" into a flags field
 . add open_nofollow() helper

 As we do not follow symbolic links when reading control files like
 .gitignore and .gitattributes from the index, match the behaviour
 and not follow symbolic links when reading them from the working
 tree.  This also tightens security a bit by not leaking contents of
 an unrelated file in the error messages when it is pointed at by
 one of these files that is a symbolic link.

 Perhaps we want to cover .gitmodules too with the same mechanism?
