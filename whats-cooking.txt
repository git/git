What's cooking in git.git (Nov 2008, #06; Wed, 26)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed
with '-' are only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are
in 'next'.

The topics list the commits in reverse chronological order.  The topics
meant to be merged to the maintenance series have "maint-" in their names.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Waiting for Ack from git-p4 folks.

* cc/bisect-skip (Sun Nov 23 22:02:49 2008 +0100) 1 commit
 - bisect: teach "skip" to accept special arguments like "A..B"

Should be in 1.6.1-rc1.

* cc/bisect-replace (Mon Nov 24 22:20:30 2008 +0100) 9 commits
 - bisect: add "--no-replace" option to bisect without using replace
   refs
 - rev-list: make it possible to disable replacing using "--no-
   bisect-replace"
 - bisect: use "--bisect-replace" options when checking merge bases
 - merge-base: add "--bisect-replace" option to use fixed up revs
 - commit: add "bisect_replace_all" prototype to "commit.h"
 - rev-list: add "--bisect-replace" to list revisions with fixed up
   history
 - Documentation: add "git bisect replace" documentation
 - bisect: add test cases for "git bisect replace"
 - bisect: add "git bisect replace" subcommand

I really hate the idea of introducing a potentially much more useful
replacement of the existing graft mechanism and tie it very tightly to
bisect, making it unusable from outside.

 (1) I do not think "bisect replace" workflow is a practical and usable
     one;

 (2) The underlying mechanism to express "this object replaces that other
     object" is much easier to work with than what the graft does which is
     "the parents of this commit are these", and idea to use the normal
     ref to point at them means this can potentially be used for
     transferring the graft information across repositories, which the
     current graft mechanism cannot do.

 (3) Because I like the aspect (2) of this series so much, it deeply
     disappoints and troubles me that this is implemented minimally near
     the surface, and that it is controlled by the "bisect" Porcelain
     alone, by explicitly passing command line arguments.

I think a mechanism like this should be added to replace grafts, but it
should always be enabled for normal revision traversal operation, while
always disabled for object enumeration and transfer operation (iow, fsck,
fetch and push should use the real ancestry information recorded in the
underlying objects, while rev-list, log, etc. should always use the
replaced objects).  I have a suspicion that even cat-file could honor it.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* bc/maint-keep-pack (Thu Nov 13 14:11:46 2008 -0600) 1 commit
 + repack: only unpack-unreachable if we are deleting redundant packs

This makes "repack -A -d" without -d do the same thing as "repack -a -d",
which makes sense.  This does not have to go to 'maint', though.

* jk/commit-v-strip (Wed Nov 12 03:23:37 2008 -0500) 4 commits
 + status: show "-v" diff even for initial commit
 + Merge branch 'jk/maint-commit-v-strip' into jk/commit-v-strip
 + wt-status: refactor initial commit printing
 + define empty tree sha1 as a macro

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Will merge to "master" soon]

* lt/preload-lstat (Mon Nov 17 09:01:20 2008 -0800) 2 commits
 + Fix index preloading for racy dirty case
 + Add cache preload facility

* ta/quiet-pull (Mon Nov 17 23:09:30 2008 +0100) 2 commits
 + Retain multiple -q/-v occurrences in git pull
 + Teach/Fix pull/fetch -q/-v options

* nd/narrow (Tue Nov 18 06:33:16 2008 -0500) 10 commits
 + t2104: touch portability fix
 + grep: skip files outside sparse checkout area
 + checkout_entry(): CE_NO_CHECKOUT on checked out entries.
 + Prevent diff machinery from examining worktree outside sparse
   checkout
 + ls-files: Add tests for --sparse and friends
 + update-index: add --checkout/--no-checkout to update
   CE_NO_CHECKOUT bit
 + update-index: refactor mark_valid() in preparation for new options
 + ls-files: add options to support sparse checkout
 + Introduce CE_NO_CHECKOUT bit
 + Extend index to save more flags

* ph/send-email (Tue Nov 11 00:54:02 2008 +0100) 4 commits
 + git send-email: ask less questions when --compose is used.
 + git send-email: add --annotate option
 + git send-email: interpret unknown files as revision lists
 + git send-email: make the message file name more specific.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Actively Cooking]

* cb/mergetool (Thu Nov 13 12:41:15 2008 +0000) 3 commits
 - [DONTMERGE] Add -k/--keep-going option to mergetool
 - Add -y/--no-prompt option to mergetool
 - Fix some tab/space inconsistencies in git-mergetool.sh

Jeff had good comments on the last one; the discussion needs concluded,
and also waiting for comments from the original author (Ted).

* ds/uintmax-config (Mon Nov 3 09:14:28 2008 -0900) 1 commit
 - autoconf: Enable threaded delta search when pthreads are supported

* jc/blame (Wed Jun 4 22:58:40 2008 -0700) 2 commits
 + blame: show "previous" information in --porcelain/--incremental
   format
 + git-blame: refactor code to emit "porcelain format" output

----------------------------------------------------------------
[On Hold]

* jc/send-pack-tell-me-more (Thu Mar 20 00:44:11 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 - "git push": tellme-more protocol extension

This seems to have a deadlock during communication between the peers.
Someone needs to pick up this topic and resolve the deadlock before it can
continue.

* jk/renamelimit (Sat May 3 13:58:42 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 - diff: enable "too large a rename" warning when -M/-C is explicitly
   asked for

This would be the right thing to do for command line use,
but gitk will be hit due to tcl/tk's limitation, so I am holding
this back for now.

* jc/stripspace (Sun Mar 9 00:30:35 2008 -0800) 6 commits
 - git-am --forge: add Signed-off-by: line for the author
 - git-am: clean-up Signed-off-by: lines
 - stripspace: add --log-clean option to clean up signed-off-by:
   lines
 - stripspace: use parse_options()
 - Add "git am -s" test
 - git-am: refactor code to add signed-off-by line for the committer
