What's cooking in git.git (Sep 2021, #07; Thu, 23)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen',
which means nothing more than that I have found them of interest for
some reason (like "it may have hard-to-resolve conflicts with
another topic already in flight" or "this may turn out to be
useful").  Do not read too much into a topic being in (or not in)
'seen'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of the
integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

The eighth batch is out.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

* ao/p4-avoid-decoding (2021-04-12) 2 commits
 . git-p4: do not decode data from perforce by default
 . git-p4: avoid decoding more data from perforce

 "git p4" in Python-2 days used to accept a lot more kinds of data
 from Perforce server as uninterrupted byte sequence, but after
 switching to Python-3, too many things are expected to be in UTF-8,
 which broke traditional use cases.
