What's cooking in git.git (Feb 2013, #01; Fri, 1)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.

As usual, this cycle is expected to last for 8 to 10 weeks, with a
preview -rc0 sometime in the middle of this month.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches of the
repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

[Graduated to "master"]

* as/test-cleanup (2013-01-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-28 at cc1147d)
 + t7102 (reset): don't hardcode SHA-1 in expected outputs


* bc/git-p4-for-python-2.4 (2013-01-30) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-31 at 1096db1)
 + INSTALL: git-p4 does not support Python 3
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-30 at 5d81ed2)
 + git-p4.py: support Python 2.4
 + git-p4.py: support Python 2.5

 With small updates to remove dependency on newer features of
 Python, keep git-p4 usable with older Python.


* jc/do-not-let-random-file-interfere-with-completion-tests (2013-01-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-28 at df27f53)
 + t9902: protect test from stray build artifacts

 Scripts to test bash completion was inherently flaky as it was
 affected by whatever random things the user may have on $PATH.


* jc/no-git-config-in-clone (2013-01-11) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-15 at feeffe1)
 + clone: do not export and unexport GIT_CONFIG

 We stopped paying attention to $GIT_CONFIG environment that points
 at a single configuration file from any command other than "git config"
 quite a while ago, but "git clone" internally set, exported, and
 then unexported the variable during its operation unnecessarily.


* jk/cvsimport-does-not-work-with-cvsps3 (2013-01-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-28 at fef4eb2)
 + git-cvsimport.txt: cvsps-2 is deprecated

 Warn people that other tools are more recommendable over
 cvsimport+cvsps2 combo when doing a one-shot import, and cvsimport
 will not work with cvsps3.


* jk/gc-auto-after-fetch (2013-01-26) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-30 at 472d07b)
 + Merge branch 'jk/maint-gc-auto-after-fetch' into jk/gc-auto-after-fetch
 (this branch uses jk/maint-gc-auto-after-fetch.)

 This is to resolve merge conflicts early for the same topic to
 recent codebase.


* jk/maint-gc-auto-after-fetch (2013-01-26) 2 commits
 + fetch-pack: avoid repeatedly re-scanning pack directory
 + fetch: run gc --auto after fetching
 (this branch is used by jk/gc-auto-after-fetch.)

 Help "fetch only" repositories that do not trigger "gc --auto"
 often enough.


* jn/do-not-drop-username-when-reading-from-etc-mailname (2013-01-25) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-28 at e0a8222)
 + ident: do not drop username when reading from /etc/mailname

 We used to stuff "user@" and then append what we read from
 /etc/mailname to come up with a default e-mail ident, but a bug
 lost the "user@" part.  This is to fix it.


* nd/edit-branch-desc-while-detached (2013-01-30) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-30 at 69307d6)
 + branch: no detached HEAD check when editing another branch's description
 (this branch is used by nd/branch-error-cases.)

 Attempt to "branch --edit-description" an existing branch, while
 being on a detached HEAD, errored out.


* nd/fetch-depth-is-broken (2013-01-11) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-15 at 70a5ca7)
 + fetch: elaborate --depth action
 + upload-pack: fix off-by-one depth calculation in shallow clone
 + fetch: add --unshallow for turning shallow repo into complete one

 "git fetch --depth" was broken in at least three ways.  The
 resulting history was deeper than specified by one commit, it was
 unclear how to wipe the shallowness of the repository with the
 command, and documentation was misleading.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* ft/transport-report-segv (2013-01-31) 1 commit
 - push: fix segfault when HEAD points nowhere

 A failure to push due to non-ff while on an unborn branch
 dereferenced a NULL pointer while showing an error message.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sb/gpg-i18n (2013-01-31) 1 commit
 - gpg: allow translation of more error messages

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sb/gpg-plug-fd-leak (2013-01-31) 1 commit
 - gpg: close stderr once finished with it in verify_signed_buffer()

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sb/run-command-fd-error-reporting (2013-01-31) 1 commit
 - run-command: be more informative about what failed

 Will merge to 'next' after spelling stdout, etc. out.


* jk/remote-helpers-doc (2013-01-31) 2 commits
 - [SQUASH] simplify maintenance of redirection pages
 - Rename {git- => git}remote-helpers.txt

 "git help remote-helpers" did not work; 'remote-helpers' is not
 a subcommand name but a concept, so its documentation should have
 been in gitremote-helpers, not git-remote-helpers.

 Will merge to 'next' after squashing the fix in.


* sp/smart-http-content-type-check (2013-01-31) 1 commit
 - Verify Content-Type from smart HTTP servers

 The smart HTTP clients forgot to verify the content-type that comes
 back from the server side to make sure that the request is being
 handled properly.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jc/mention-tracking-for-pull-default (2013-01-31) 1 commit
 - doc: mention tracking for pull.default

 We stopped mentioning `tracking` is a deprecated but supported
 synonym for `upstream` in pull.default even though we have no
 intention of removing the support for it.

 This is my "don't list it to catch readers' eyes, but make sure it
 can be found if the reader looks for it" version; I'm not married
 to the layout and am willing to take a replacement patch.


* jc/fake-ancestor-with-non-blobs (2013-01-31) 3 commits
 - apply: diagnose incomplete submodule object name better
 - apply: simplify build_fake_ancestor()
 - git-am: record full index line in the patch used while rebasing

 Rebasing the history of superproject with change in the submodule
 has been broken since v1.7.12.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/doc-makefile-cleanup (2013-02-01) 1 commit
 - Documentation/Makefile: clean up MAN*_TXT lists

 Will merge to 'next'.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* dg/subtree-fixes (2013-01-08) 7 commits
 - contrib/subtree: mkdir the manual directory if needed
 - contrib/subtree: honor $(DESTDIR)
 - contrib/subtree: fix synopsis and command help
 - contrib/subtree: better error handling for "add"
 - contrib/subtree: add --unannotate option
 - contrib/subtree: use %B for split Subject/Body
 - t7900: remove test number comments

 contrib/subtree updates; there are a few more from T. Zheng that
 were posted separately, with an overlap.

 Expecting a reroll.


* mp/diff-algo-config (2013-01-16) 3 commits
 - diff: Introduce --diff-algorithm command line option
 - config: Introduce diff.algorithm variable
 - git-completion.bash: Autocomplete --minimal and --histogram for git-diff

 Add diff.algorithm configuration so that the user does not type
 "diff --histogram".

 Looking better; may want tests to protect it from future breakages,
 but otherwise it looks ready for 'next'.

 Expecting a follow-up to add tests.


* mb/gitweb-highlight-link-target (2012-12-20) 1 commit
 - Highlight the link target line in Gitweb using CSS

 Expecting a reroll.
 $gmane/211935


* jl/submodule-deinit (2012-12-04) 1 commit
 - submodule: add 'deinit' command

 There was no Porcelain way to say "I no longer am interested in
 this submodule", once you express your interest in a submodule with
 "submodule init".  "submodule deinit" is the way to do so.

 Expecting a reroll.
 $gmane/212884


* jk/lua-hackery (2012-10-07) 6 commits
 - pretty: fix up one-off format_commit_message calls
 - Minimum compilation fixup
 - Makefile: make "lua" a bit more configurable
 - add a "lua" pretty format
 - add basic lua infrastructure
 - pretty: make some commit-parsing helpers more public

 Interesting exercise. When we do this for real, we probably would want
 to wrap a commit to make it more like an "object" with methods like
 "parents", etc.


* rc/maint-complete-git-p4 (2012-09-24) 1 commit
 - Teach git-completion about git p4

 Comment from Pete will need to be addressed ($gmane/206172).


* jc/maint-name-rev (2012-09-17) 7 commits
 - describe --contains: use "name-rev --algorithm=weight"
 - name-rev --algorithm=weight: tests and documentation
 - name-rev --algorithm=weight: cache the computed weight in notes
 - name-rev --algorithm=weight: trivial optimization
 - name-rev: --algorithm option
 - name_rev: clarify the logic to assign a new tip-name to a commit
 - name-rev: lose unnecessary typedef

 "git name-rev" names the given revision based on a ref that can be
 reached in the smallest number of steps from the rev, but that is
 not useful when the caller wants to know which tag is the oldest one
 that contains the rev.  This teaches a new mode to the command that
 uses the oldest ref among those which contain the rev.

 I am not sure if this is worth it; for one thing, even with the help
 from notes-cache, it seems to make the "describe --contains" even
 slower. Also the command will be unusably slow for a user who does
 not have a write access (hence unable to create or update the
 notes-cache).

 Stalled mostly due to lack of responses.


* jc/xprm-generation (2012-09-14) 1 commit
 - test-generation: compute generation numbers and clock skews

 A toy to analyze how bad the clock skews are in histories of real
 world projects.

 Stalled mostly due to lack of responses.


* jc/add-delete-default (2012-08-13) 1 commit
 - git add: notice removal of tracked paths by default

 "git add dir/" updated modified files and added new files, but does
 not notice removed files, which may be "Huh?" to some users.  They
 can of course use "git add -A dir/", but why should they?

 Resurrected from graveyard, as I thought it was a worthwhile thing
 to do in the longer term.

 Stalled mostly due to lack of responses.


* mb/remote-default-nn-origin (2012-07-11) 6 commits
 - Teach get_default_remote to respect remote.default.
 - Test that plain "git fetch" uses remote.default when on a detached HEAD.
 - Teach clone to set remote.default.
 - Teach "git remote" about remote.default.
 - Teach remote.c about the remote.default configuration setting.
 - Rename remote.c's default_remote_name static variables.

 When the user does not specify what remote to interact with, we
 often attempt to use 'origin'.  This can now be customized via a
 configuration variable.

 Expecting a reroll.
 $gmane/210151

 "The first remote becomes the default" bit is better done as a
 separate step.


* nd/parse-pathspec (2013-01-11) 20 commits
 . Convert more init_pathspec() to parse_pathspec()
 . Convert add_files_to_cache to take struct pathspec
 . Convert {read,fill}_directory to take struct pathspec
 . Convert refresh_index to take struct pathspec
 . Convert report_path_error to take struct pathspec
 . checkout: convert read_tree_some to take struct pathspec

 . clean: convert to use parse_pathspec
 . Export parse_pathspec() and convert some get_pathspec() calls
 . Add parse_pathspec() that converts cmdline args to struct pathspec
 . pathspec: save the non-wildcard length part

 Uses the parsed pathspec structure in more places where we used to
 use the raw "array of strings" pathspec.

 Ejected from 'pu' for now; will take a look at the rerolled one
 later ($gmane/213340).

[Cooking]

* ab/gitweb-use-same-scheme (2013-01-28) 1 commit
 - gitweb: refer to picon/gravatar images over the same scheme

 Avoid mixed contents on a page coming via http and https when
 gitweb is hosted on a https server.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/python-styles (2013-01-30) 1 commit
 - CodingGuidelines: add Python coding guidelines

 Will merge to 'next'.


* mn/send-email-authinfo (2013-01-29) 1 commit
 - git-send-email: add ~/.authinfo parsing

 Expecting a reroll.
 $gmane/215004, $gmane/215024.


* mp/complete-paths (2013-01-11) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-30 at 70e4f1a)
 + git-completion.bash: add support for path completion

 The completion script used to let the default completer to suggest
 pathnames, which gave too many irrelevant choices (e.g. "git add"
 would not want to add an unmodified path).  Teach it to use a more
 git-aware logic to enumerate only relevant ones.

 This is logically the right thing to do, and we would really love
 to see people who have been involved in completion code to review
 and comment on the implementation.

 Will cook in 'next' to see if anybody screams.


* jk/read-commit-buffer-data-after-free (2013-01-26) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-30 at c6d7e16)
 + logmsg_reencode: lazily load missing commit buffers
 + logmsg_reencode: never return NULL
 + commit: drop useless xstrdup of commit message

 Clarify the ownership rule for commit->buffer field, which some
 callers incorrectly accessed without making sure it is populated.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* pw/git-p4-on-cygwin (2013-01-26) 21 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-30 at 958ae3a)

 + git p4: avoid shell when calling git config
 + git p4: avoid shell when invoking git config --get-all
 + git p4: avoid shell when invoking git rev-list
 + git p4: avoid shell when mapping users
 + git p4: disable read-only attribute before deleting
 + git p4 test: use test_chmod for cygwin
 + git p4: cygwin p4 client does not mark read-only
 + git p4 test: avoid wildcard * in windows
 + git p4 test: use LineEnd unix in windows tests too
 + git p4 test: newline handling
 + git p4: scrub crlf for utf16 files on windows
 + git p4: remove unreachable windows \r\n conversion code
 + git p4 test: translate windows paths for cygwin
 + git p4 test: start p4d inside its db dir
 + git p4 test: use client_view in t9806
 + git p4 test: avoid loop in client_view
 + git p4 test: use client_view to build the initial client
 + git p4: generate better error message for bad depot path
 + git p4: remove unused imports
 + git p4: temp branch name should use / even on windows

 Improve "git p4" on Cygwin.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ss/mergetools-tortoise (2013-02-01) 2 commits
 - mergetools: teach tortoisemerge to handle filenames with SP correctly
 - mergetools: support TortoiseGitMerge

 Update mergetools to work better with newer merge helper tortoise ships.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* da/mergetool-docs (2013-01-30) 7 commits
 - doc: generate a list of valid merge tools
 - mergetool--lib: list user configured tools in '--tool-help'
 - fixup! doc: generate a list of valid merge tools
 - fixup! mergetool--lib: add functions for finding available tools
 - mergetool--lib: add functions for finding available tools
 - mergetool--lib: improve the help text in guess_merge_tool()
 - mergetool--lib: simplify command expressions
 (this branch uses jk/mergetool.)

 Build on top of the clean-up done by jk/mergetool and automatically
 generate the list of mergetool and difftool backends the build
 supports to be included in the documentation.

 Will merge to 'next', after squashing the fixup! commits from John
 Keeping.


* nd/branch-error-cases (2013-01-31) 6 commits
 - branch: let branch filters imply --list
 - docs: clarify git-branch --list behavior
 - branch: mark more strings for translation
 - Merge branch 'nd/edit-branch-desc-while-detached' into HEAD
 - branch: give a more helpful message on redundant arguments
 - branch: reject -D/-d without branch name

 Fix various error messages and conditions in "git branch", e.g. we
 advertised "branch -d/-D" to remove one or more branches but actually
 implemented removal of zero or more branches---request to remove no
 branches was not rejected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jc/push-reject-reasons (2013-01-24) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-28 at b60be93)
 + push: finishing touches to explain REJECT_ALREADY_EXISTS better
 + push: introduce REJECT_FETCH_FIRST and REJECT_NEEDS_FORCE
 + push: further simplify the logic to assign rejection reason
 + push: further clean up fields of "struct ref"

 Improve error and advice messages given locally when "git push"
 refuses when it cannot compute fast-forwardness by separating these
 cases from the normal "not a fast-forward; merge first and push
 again" case.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/mergetool (2013-01-28) 8 commits
 - mergetools: simplify how we handle "vim" and "defaults"
 - mergetool--lib: don't call "exit" in setup_tool
 - mergetool--lib: improve show_tool_help() output
 - mergetools/vim: remove redundant diff command
 - git-difftool: use git-mergetool--lib for "--tool-help"
 - git-mergetool: don't hardcode 'mergetool' in show_tool_help
 - git-mergetool: remove redundant assignment
 - git-mergetool: move show_tool_help to mergetool--lib
 (this branch is used by da/mergetool-docs.)

 Cleans up mergetool/difftool combo.

 This is looking ready for 'next'.


* mm/add-u-A-sans-pathspec (2013-01-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-28 at fe762a6)
 + add: warn when -u or -A is used without pathspec

 Forbid "git add -u" and "git add -A" without pathspec run from a
 subdirectory, to train people to type "." (or ":/") to make the
 choice of default does not matter.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/hidden-refs (2013-01-30) 8 commits
 - WIP: receive.allowupdatestohidden
 - fetch: fetch objects by their exact SHA-1 object names
 - upload-pack: optionally allow fetching from the tips of hidden refs
 - fetch: use struct ref to represent refs to be fetched
 - parse_fetch_refspec(): clarify the codeflow a bit
 - upload/receive-pack: allow hiding ref hierarchies
 - upload-pack: simplify request validation
 - upload-pack: share more code

 Allow the server side to unclutter the refs/ namespace it shows to
 the client.  Optionally allow requests for histories leading to the
 tips of hidden refs by updated clients.


* ta/doc-no-small-caps (2013-02-01) 6 commits
 - Documentation: StGit is the right spelling, not StGIT
 - Documentation: describe the "repository" in repository-layout
 - Documentation: add a description for 'gitfile' to glossary
 - Documentation: do not use undefined terms git-dir and git-file
 - Documentation: the name of the system is 'Git', not 'git'
 - Documentation: avoid poor-man's small caps GIT

 Update documentation to change "GIT" which was a poor-man's small
 caps to "Git" which was the intended spelling.  Also change "git"
 spelled in all-lowercase to "Git" when it refers to the system as
 the whole or the concept it embodies, as opposed to the command the
 end users would type.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jc/remove-treesame-parent-in-simplify-merges (2013-01-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-30 at b639b47)
 + simplify-merges: drop merge from irrelevant side branch

 The --simplify-merges logic did not cull irrelevant parents from a
 merge that is otherwise not interesting with respect to the paths
 we are following.

 This touches a fairly core part of the revision traversal
 infrastructure; even though I think this change is correct, please
 report immediately if you find any unintended side effect.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/remote-helpers-in-python-3 (2013-01-30) 10 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-31 at 5a948aa)
 + git_remote_helpers: remove GIT-PYTHON-VERSION upon "clean"
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-28 at d898471)
 + git-remote-testpy: fix path hashing on Python 3
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-25 at acf9419)
 + git-remote-testpy: call print as a function
 + git-remote-testpy: don't do unbuffered text I/O
 + git-remote-testpy: hash bytes explicitly
 + svn-fe: allow svnrdump_sim.py to run with Python 3

 + git_remote_helpers: force rebuild if python version changes
 + git_remote_helpers: fix input when running under Python 3
 + git_remote_helpers: allow building with Python 3

 Prepare remote-helper test written in Python to be run with Python3.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/config-parsing-cleanup (2013-01-23) 8 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-28 at 9bc9411)
 + reflog: use parse_config_key in config callback
 + help: use parse_config_key for man config
 + submodule: simplify memory handling in config parsing
 + submodule: use parse_config_key when parsing config
 + userdiff: drop parse_driver function
 + convert some config callbacks to parse_config_key
 + archive-tar: use parse_config_key when parsing config
 + config: add helper function for parsing key names

 Configuration parsing for tar.* configuration variables were
 broken. Introduce a new config-keyname parser API to make the
 callers much less error prone.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/custom-comment-char (2013-01-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-25 at 91d8a5d)
 + Allow custom "comment char"

 An illustration to show codepaths that need to be touched to change
 the hint lines in the edited text to begin with something other
 than '#'.

 This is half my work and half by Ralf Thielow.  There may still be
 leftover '#' lurking around, though.  My "git grep" says C code
 should be already fine, but git-rebase--interactive.sh could be
 converted (it should not matter, as the file is not really a
 free-form text).

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/push-2.0-default-to-simple (2013-01-16) 14 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-16 at 23f5df2)
 + t5570: do not assume the "matching" push is the default
 + t5551: do not assume the "matching" push is the default
 + t5550: do not assume the "matching" push is the default
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-09 at 74c3498)
 + doc: push.default is no longer "matching"
 + push: switch default from "matching" to "simple"
 + t9401: do not assume the "matching" push is the default
 + t9400: do not assume the "matching" push is the default
 + t7406: do not assume the "matching" push is the default
 + t5531: do not assume the "matching" push is the default
 + t5519: do not assume the "matching" push is the default
 + t5517: do not assume the "matching" push is the default
 + t5516: do not assume the "matching" push is the default
 + t5505: do not assume the "matching" push is the default
 + t5404: do not assume the "matching" push is the default

 Will cook in 'next' until Git 2.0 ;-).


* bc/append-signed-off-by (2013-01-27) 11 commits
 - Unify appending signoff in format-patch, commit and sequencer
 - format-patch: update append_signoff prototype
 - t4014: more tests about appending s-o-b lines
 - sequencer.c: teach append_signoff to avoid adding a duplicate newline
 - sequencer.c: teach append_signoff how to detect duplicate s-o-b
 - sequencer.c: always separate "(cherry picked from" from commit body
 - sequencer.c: recognize "(cherry picked from ..." as part of s-o-b footer
 - t/t3511: add some tests of 'cherry-pick -s' functionality
 - t/test-lib-functions.sh: allow to specify the tag name to test_commit
 - commit, cherry-pick -s: remove broken support for multiline rfc2822 fields
 - sequencer.c: rework search for start of footer to improve clarity

 Waiting for the final round of reroll before merging to 'next'.
 After that we will go incremental.

--------------------------------------------------
[Discarded]

* jk/update-install-for-p4 (2013-01-20) 1 commit
 . INSTALL: git-p4 doesn't support Python 3

 Made obsolete by bc/git-p4-for-python-2.4 topic.
