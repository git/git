Subject: What's cooking in git.git (Jul 2014, #02; Mon, 14)

What's cooking in git.git (Jul 2014, #02; Mon, 14)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.

We would need to start slowing down to prepare for -rc0 preview at
the end of next week and then feature freeze.  Some topics that
joined 'next' late may want to stay there for the remainder of this
cycle.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* jk/skip-prefix (2014-07-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-07-14 at 0fbd06e)
 + tag: use skip_prefix instead of magic numbers
 (this branch is used by jk/tag-sort.)

 Will merge to 'master'.

 One more to an already graduated topic.


* rs/code-cleaning (2014-07-10) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-07-14 at d5a89c8)
 + fsck: simplify fsck_commit_buffer() by using commit_list_count()
 + commit: use commit_list_append() instead of duplicating its code
 + merge: simplify merge_trivial() by using commit_list_append()
 + use strbuf_addch for adding single characters
 + use strbuf_addbuf for adding strbufs

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ah/fix-http-push (2014-07-13) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-07-14 at 5d06516)
 + http-push.c: make CURLOPT_IOCTLDATA a usable pointer

 An ancient rewrite passed a wrong pointer to a curl library
 function in a rarely used code path.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/reopen-lock-file (2014-07-14) 1 commit
 - lockfile: allow reopening a closed but still locked file

 index.

 Make sure all in-core commit objects are assigned a unique number
 so that they can be annotated using the commit-slab API.

  (merged to 'next' on 2014-07-02 at cc0c4b1)
 + builtin/clone.c: detect a clone starting at a tag correctly

 "git clone -b brefs/tags/bar" would have mistakenly thought we were
 following a single tag, even though it was a name of the branch,
 because it incorrectly used strstr().

  (merged to 'next' on 2014-06-26 at 7138407)

 + t7510: test a commit signed by an unknown key
 + t7510: use consistent &&-chains in loop
 + t7510: stop referring to master in later tests

 "%G" (nothing after G) is an invalid pretty format specifier, but
 the parser did not notice it as garbage.


* jk/xstrfmt (2014-06-25) 11 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-06-25 at 5031d4e)

 Add 'verify-commit' to be used in a way similar to 'verify-tag' is
 used.  Further work on verifying the mergetags might be needed.

 Ejected from 'pu' to unclutter.
 Expecting a reroll.


* bg/rebase-off-of-previous-branch (2014-04-16) 1 commit
 - git-rebase: print name of rev when using shorthand

 Teach "git rebase -" to report the concrete name of the branch
 (i.e. the previous one).

 But it stops short and does not do the same for "git rebase @{-1}".
 Expecting a reroll.


* tr/merge-recursive-index-only (2014-02-05) 3 commits
 - merge-recursive: -Xindex-only to leave worktree unchanged
 - merge-recursive: internal flag to avoid touching the worktree
 - merge-recursive: remove dead conditional in update_stages()

 . log --remerge-diff: show what the conflict resolution changed
 . name-hash: allow dir hashing even when !ignore_case
 . merge-recursive: allow storing conflict hunks in index
 . revision: fold all merge diff variants into an enum merge_diff_mode
 . combine-diff: do not pass revs->dense_combined_merges redundantly
 (this branch uses tr/merge-recursive-index-only.)

 "log -p" output learns a new way to let users inspect a merge
 commit by showing the differences between the automerged result
 with conflicts the person who recorded the merge would have seen
 and the final conflict resolution that was recorded in the merge.

 Needs to be rebased, now kb/fast-hashmap topic is in.

 quoting purposes, and make it easier to robustly express the
 dependency rules.

 Expecting a reroll.


* po/everyday-doc (2014-01-27) 1 commit
 - Make 'git help everyday' work

 This may make the said command to emit something, but the source is
 not meant to be formatted into a manual pages to begin with, and
 also its contents are a bit stale.  It may be a good first step in
 the right direction, but needs more work to at least get the
 mark-up right before public consumption.

 Will hold.

 - merge: drop unused arg from abort_commit method signature

 - t7505: ensure cleanup after hook blocks merge
 - t7505: add missing &&

 Expose more merge states (e.g. $GIT_DIR/MERGE_MODE) to hooks that
 run during "git merge".  The log message stresses too much on one
 hook, prepare-commit-msg, but it would equally apply to other hooks
 like post-merge, I think.

 Waiting for a reroll.


* jc/graph-post-root-gap (2013-12-30) 3 commits
 - WIP: document what we want at the end
 - graph: remove unused code a bit
 - graph: stuff the current commit into graph->columns[]

 This was primarily a RFH ($gmane/239580).

 - perf-lib: add test_perf_cleanup target

 Waiting for the final step to lift the hard-limit before sending it out.


* jh/submodule-tests (2014-04-17) 1 commit
 - t7410: 210 tests for various 'git submodule update' scenarios

 More or less abandoned.  Will drop.

 - git_snpath(): retire and replace with strbuf_git_path()
 - path.c: make get_pathname() call sites return const char *

 A replacement for contrib/workdir/git-new-workdir that does not

 by making the borrowee and borrowers aware of each other.

 - tests: drop GIT_*_TIMING_TESTS environment variable support

 Test-script clean-up.

 Will hold.


* mt/patch-id-stable (2014-06-10) 1 commit
 - patch-id: change default to stable

 Teaches "git patch-id" to compute the patch ID that does not change
 when the files in a single patch is reordered. As this new algorithm
 is backward incompatible, the last bit to flip it to be the default
 is left out of 'master' for now.

 Will hold.
