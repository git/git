What's cooking in git.git (May 2022, #07; Wed, 25)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen',
and aren't considered "accepted" at all.

This cycle will conclude in early July (https://tinyurl.com/gitCal);
we are in the week #5 of the cycle.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/

  (merged to 'next' on 2022-05-16 at 75d760528f)
 + commit-graph.c: don't assume that stat() succeeds
 + object-file: fix a unpack_loose_header() regression in 3b6a8db3b03
 + log test: skip a failing mkstemp() test under valgrind
 + tests: using custom GIT_EXEC_PATH breaks --valgrind tests
 (this branch is used by ds/object-file-unpack-loose-header-fix.)

 A bit of test framework fixes with a few fixes to issues found by
 valgrind.

  (merged to 'next' on 2022-05-18 at e4a51b0867)
 + Makefile: add a prerequisite to the coverage-report target

 "make coverage-report" without first running "make coverage" did
 not produce any meaningful result, which has been corrected.

* jc/archive-add-file-normalize-mode (2022-05-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2022-05-16 at 265bb02f2a)
 + archive: do not let on-disk mode leak to zip archives

 "git archive --add-file=<path>" picked up the raw permission bits
 from the path and propagated to zip output in some cases, without
 normalization, which has been corrected (tar output did not have
 this issue).

* jc/avoid-redundant-submodule-fetch (2022-05-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2022-05-19 at 11dabe678b)
 + fetch: do not run a redundant fetch from submodule

 "git fetch --recurse-submodules" from multiple remotes (either from
 a remote group, or "--all") used to make one extra "git fetch" in
 the submodules, which has been corrected.
 source: <xmqqk0alyqyj.fsf_-_@gitster.g>


* jc/show-branch-g-current (2022-04-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2022-05-18 at 870a1a1a71)
 + show-branch: -g and --current are incompatible

 The "--current" option of "git show-branch" should have been made
 incompatible with the "--reflog" mode, but this was not enforced,
 which has been corrected.
 source: <xmqqh76mf7s4.fsf_-_@gitster.g>


* jt/fetch-peek-optional-section (2022-05-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2022-05-18 at bc876bd2cf)
 + fetch-pack: make unexpected peek result non-fatal

 "git fetch" unnecessarily failed when an unexpected optional
 section appeared in the output, which has been corrected.

* os/fetch-check-not-current-branch (2022-05-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2022-05-19 at f48dca6322)
 + fetch: limit shared symref check only for local branches

 The way "git fetch" without "--update-head-ok" ensures that HEAD in
 no worktree points at any ref being updated was too wasteful, which
 has been optimized a bit.

 (this branch uses cb/path-owner-check-with-sudo.)

 "sudo git foo" used to consider a repository owned by the original
 user a safe one to access; it now also considers a repository owned
 by root a safe one, too (after all, if an attacker can craft a
 malicious repository owned by root, the box is 0wned already).

 - hook API: don't redundantly re-set "no_stdin" and "stdout_to_stderr"
 - hook tests: fix redirection logic error in 96e7225b310
 - run-command: add an "ungroup" option to run_process_parallel()
 - run-command.c: add an initializer for "struct parallel_processes"
 - run-command tests: test stdout of run_command_parallel()
 - run-command API: use "opts" struct for run_processes_parallel{,_tr2}()
 - run-command tests: change if/if/... to if/else if/else

 In Git 2.36 we revamped the way how hooks are invoked.  One change
 that is end-user visible is that the output of a hook is no longer
 directly connected to the standard output of "git" that spawns the
 hook, which was noticed post release.  This is getting corrected.

* cb/path-owner-check-with-sudo (2022-05-12) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2022-05-19 at d282e56560)
 + t0034: add negative tests and allow git init to mostly work under sudo
 + git-compat-util: avoid failing dir ownership checks if running privileged
 + t: regression git needs safe.directory when using sudo
 (this branch is used by cb/path-owner-check-with-sudo-plus.)

 With a recent update to refuse access to repositories of other
 people by default, "sudo make install" and "sudo git describe"
 stopped working.  This series intends to loosen it while keeping
 the safety.

* ar/send-email-confirm-by-default (2022-04-22) 1 commit
 - send-email: always confirm by default

 "git send-email" is changed so that by default it asks for
 confirmation before sending each message out.

 Will discard.

 I wanted to like this, and had it in the version of Git I use
 myself for daily work, but the prompting turned out to be somewhat
 distracting.

 Thoughts?

* ab/env-array (2022-05-20) 4 commits

 - cocci: add a rename of "struct child_process"'s "env_array" to "env"

* tk/simple-autosetupmerge (2022-04-29) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2022-05-19 at 9666852f1e)
 + push: new config option "push.autoSetupRemote" supports "simple" push
 + push: default to single remote even when not named origin
 + branch: new autosetupmerge option 'simple' for matching branches

 "git -c branch.autosetupmerge=simple branch $A $B" will set the $B
 as $A's upstream only when $A and $B shares the same name, and "git
 -c push.default=simple" on branch $A would push to update the
 branch $A at the remote $B came from.  Also more places use the
 sole remote, if exists, before defaulting to 'origin'.

 Will merge to 'master'.
