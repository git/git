What's cooking in git.git (Jun 2018, #01; Fri, 1)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* ag/rebase-p (2018-06-01) 4 commits
 - rebase: remove -p code from git-rebase--interactive.sh
 - rebase: use the new git-rebase--preserve-merges.sh
 - rebase: strip unused code in git-rebase--preserve-merges.sh
 - rebase: introduce a dedicated backend for --preserve-merges

 Separate "rebase -p" codepath out of "rebase -i" implementation to
 slim down the latter and make it easier to manage.


* jk/index-pack-maint (2018-06-01) 2 commits
 - index-pack: handle --strict checks of non-repo packs
 - prepare_commit_graft: treat non-repository as a noop

 "index-pack --strict" has been taught to make sure that it runs the
 final object integrity checks after making the freshly indexed
 packfile available to itself.

 Will merge to 'next' and then to 'master'.


* ls/complete-remote-update-names (2018-06-01) 1 commit
 - completion: complete remote names too

 "git remote update" can take both a single remote nickname and a
 nickname for remote groups, and the completion script (in contrib/)
 has been taught about it.

 Will merge to and cook in 'next'.


* nd/remote-update-doc (2018-06-01) 1 commit
 - remote.txt: update documentation for 'update' command

 "git remote update" can take both a single remote nickname and a
 nickname for remote groups, but only one of them was documented.

 Will merge to 'next' and then to 'master'.


* rd/p4-doc-markup-env (2018-06-01) 1 commit
 - p4.txt: Use backquotes for variable names

 Doc markup update.

 Will merge to 'next' and then to 'master'.

* bc/hash-independent-tests (2018-05-21) 28 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-24 at 40fb709f7c)

 + t/test-lib: introduce OID_REGEX
 + t: switch $_z40 to $ZERO_OID
 + t/test-lib: introduce ZERO_OID
 + t/test-lib: add an SHA1 prerequisite

 Many tests hardcode the raw object names, which would change once
 we migrate away from SHA-1.  While some of them must test against
 exact object names, most of them do not have to use hardcoded
 constants in the test.  The latter kind of tests have been updated
 to test the moral equivalent of the original without hardcoding the
 actual object names.


* bw/ref-prefix-for-configured-refspec (2018-05-18) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-24 at a0d4af6180)
 + fetch: generate ref-prefixes when using a configured refspec
 + refspec: consolidate ref-prefix generation logic
 (this branch uses bw/refspec-api.)

 "git fetch $there $refspec" that talks over protocol v2 can take
 advantage of server-side ref filtering; the code has been extended
 so that this mechanism triggers also when fetching with configured
 refspec.


* bw/remote-curl-compressed-responses (2018-05-23) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-24 at 98ee4308dc)
 + remote-curl: accept compressed responses with protocol v2
 + remote-curl: accept all encodings supported by curl

 Our HTTP client code used to advertise that we accept gzip encoding
 from the other side; instead, just let cURL library to advertise
 and negotiate the best one.


* cc/tests-without-assuming-ref-files-backend (2018-05-30) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-30 at e9605bacf0)
 + t990X: use '.git/objects' as 'deep inside .git' path
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-24 at 19138b162f)
 + t: make many tests depend less on the refs being files

 Quite a many tests assumed that newly created refs are made as
 loose refs using the files backend, which have been updated to use
 proper plumbing like rev-parse and update-ref, to avoid breakage
 once we start using different ref backends.


* en/rev-parse-invalid-range (2018-05-25) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-30 at aec27f8a94)
 + rev-parse: check lookup'ed commit references for NULL

 "git rev-parse Y..." etc. misbehaved when given endpoints were
 not committishes.

 Error codepath fix.


* jk/snprintf-truncation (2018-05-21) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-24 at 4b78e15f66)
 + fmt_with_err: add a comment that truncation is OK
 + shorten_unambiguous_ref: use xsnprintf
 + fsmonitor: use internal argv_array of struct child_process
 + log_write_email_headers: use strbufs
 + http: use strbufs instead of fixed buffers

 Avoid unchecked snprintf() to make future code auditing easier.


* js/empty-config-section-fix (2018-05-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-24 at 3d0875c7b4)
 + config: a user-provided invalid section is not a BUG

 Error codepath fix.


* js/rebase-recreate-merge (2018-05-30) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-30 at e295dfb56e)

  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-30 at 7367508399)
 + git-p4: add unshelve command

 "git p4" learned to "unshelve" shelved commit from P4.


* ma/config-store-data-clear (2018-05-21) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-24 at cc6e4b9371)

  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-24 at 3e473da1b5)
 + regex: do not call `regfree()` if compilation fails

 We used to call regfree() after regcomp() failed in some codepaths,
 which have been corrected.


* ma/unpack-trees-free-msgs (2018-05-22) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-24 at 84cbd459f7)
 + unpack_trees_options: free messages when done
 + argv-array: return the pushed string from argv_push*()
 + merge-recursive: provide pair of `unpack_trees_{start,finish}()`
 + merge: setup `opts` later in `checkout_fast_forward()`

 Leak plugging.


* nd/command-list (2018-05-21) 17 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-24 at 093e983b05)
 + completion: allow to customize the completable command list
 + completion: add and use --list-cmds=alias
 + completion: add and use --list-cmds=nohelpers

 + help: use command-list.h for common command list
 + generate-cmds.sh: export all commands to command-list.h
 + generate-cmds.sh: factor out synopsis extract code
 (this branch is used by nd/complete-config-vars.)

 The list of commands with their various attributes were spread
 across a few places in the build procedure, but it now is getting a
 bit more consolidated to allow more automation.


* nd/use-opt-int-set-f (2018-05-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-30 at f8f5d612ed)
 + Use OPT_SET_INT_F() for cmdline option specification

 Code simplification.


* pa/import-tars-long-names (2018-05-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-30 at 5e043b2fca)
 + import-tars: read overlong names from pax extended header

 The import-tars script (in contrib/) has been taught to handle
 tarballs with overly long paths that use PAX extended headers.


* rd/doc-options-placeholder (2018-05-25) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-30 at e3961b038f)
 + Use proper syntax for replaceables in command docs

 Docfix.


* rd/init-typo (2018-05-30) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-30 at 8813a649eb)
 + init: fix grammar in "templates not found" msg

 Message fix.


* rd/tag-doc-lightweight (2018-05-29) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-30 at 979ba9f720)
 + tag: clarify in the doc that a tag can refer to a non-commit object

 Docfix.


* sb/grep-die-on-unreadable-index (2018-05-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-24 at 6d78916503)
 + grep: handle corrupt index files early

 Error behaviour of "git grep" when it cannot read the index was
 inconsistent with other commands that uses the index, which has
 been corrected to error out early.


* sb/submodule-merge-in-merge-recursive (2018-05-18) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-24 at 6228d22182)
 + merge-recursive: give notice when submodule commit gets fast-forwarded
 + merge-recursive: i18n submodule merge output and respect verbosity
 + submodule.c: move submodule merging to merge-recursive.c

 By code restructuring of submodule merge in merge-recursive,
 informational messages from the codepath are now given using the
 same mechanism as other output, and honor the merge.verbosity
 configuration.  The code also learned to give a few new messages
 when a submodule three-way merge resolves cleanly when one side
 records a descendant of the commit chosen by the other side.

 - add -p: allow line selection to be inverted
 - add -p: select individual hunk lines

 "git add -p" interactive interface learned to let users choose
 individual added/removed lines to be used in the operation, instead
 of accepting or rejecting a whole hunk.

 Expecting a reroll to reignite the discussion.

* jh/json-writer (2018-03-28) 1 commit
 - json_writer: new routines to create data in JSON format

 Preparatory code to later add json output for unspecified telemetry
 data.

 We do not add random code that does not have real users to our
 codebase, so let's have it wait until such a real code materializes
 before too long.


* hn/bisect-first-parent (2018-04-21) 1 commit
 - bisect: create 'bisect_flags' parameter in find_bisection()

 Preliminary code update to allow passing more flags down the
 bisection codepath in the future.

 We do not add random code that does not have real users to our
 codebase, so let's have it wait until such a real code materializes
 before too long.


* is/parsing-line-range (2018-06-01) 2 commits
 . log: prevent error if line range ends past end of file
 . blame: prevent error if range ends past end of file

 Parsing of -L[<N>][,[<M>]] parameters "git blame" and "git log"
 take has been tweaked.

 Updated.   Still seems to break a few tests.

* mk/http-backend-content-length (2017-11-27) 4 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - t5560-http-backend-noserver.sh: add CONTENT_LENGTH cases
 - SQUASH???
 - http-backend: respect CONTENT_LENGTH as specified by rfc3875

 The http-backend (used for smart-http transport) used to slurp the
 whole input until EOF, without paying attention to CONTENT_LENGTH
 that is supplied in the environment and instead expecting the Web
 server to close the input stream.  This has been fixed.

 Expecting a reroll.
 Suggested fixes to be used when rerolling is queued, but I'd
 prefer _not_ squashing them myself.

 Also, it may be too complex solution for the problem.

 Expecting a reroll.


* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2017-08-10) 1 commit
 . zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

 Needs resurrecting by making sure the fix is good and still applies
 (or adjusted to today's codebase).

  (merged to 'next' on 2018-06-01 at cd3e2a1008)
 + submodule: do not pass null OID to setup_revisions

 "git pull -recurse-submodules --rebase", when the submodule
 repository's history did not have anything common between ours and
 the upstream's, failed to execute.  We need to fetch from them to
 continue even in such a case.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ma/wrapped-info (2018-05-28) 2 commits
 - usage: prefix all lines in `vreportf()`, not just the first
 - usage: extract `prefix_suffix_lines()` from `advise()`

 An attempt to help making multi-line messages fed to warning(),
 error(), and friends more easily translatable.

 Wait for discussion to settle.

 - completion: complete general config vars in two steps
 - log-tree: allow to customize 'grafted' color
 - completion: support case-insensitive config vars
 - completion: keep other config var completion in camelCase
 - completion: drop the hard coded list of config vars
 - am: move advice.amWorkDir parsing back to advice.c

 - fsck: produce camelCase config key names
 - help: add --config to list all available config
 - fsck: factor out msg_id_info[] lazy initialization code
 - grep: keep all colors in an array
 - Add and use generic name->id mapping code for color slot parsing
 - Merge branch 'nd/command-list' into nd/complete-config-vars

 Continuing with the idea to programatically enumerate various
 pieces of data required for command line completion, teach the
 codebase to report the list of configuration variables
 subcommands care about to help complete them.

 Will merge to and cook in 'next'.


* nd/completion-negation (2018-05-29) 3 commits
 - completion: collapse extra --no-.. options
 - completion: suppress some -no- options
 - parse-options: option to let --git-completion-helper show negative form

 Continuing with the idea to programatically enumerate various
 pieces of data required for command line completion, the codebase
 has been taught to enumerate options prefixed with "--no-" to
 negate them.

 Will merge to and cook in 'next'.

 - mem-pool: add lifecycle management functions
 - mem-pool: only search head block for available space
 - block alloc: add lifecycle APIs for cache_entry structs
 - read-cache: teach refresh_cache_entry() to take istate

 For a large tree, the index needs to hold many cache entries
 allocated on heap.  These cache entries are now allocated out of a
 dedicated memory pool to amortize malloc(3) overhead.

 Is this ready for 'next'?

* nd/commit-util-to-slab (2018-05-21) 15 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-24 at bb5643d75c)
 + commit.h: delete 'util' field in struct commit
 + merge: use commit-slab in merge remote desc instead of commit->util
 + log: use commit-slab in prepare_bases() instead of commit->util
 + show-branch: note about its object flags usage
 + show-branch: use commit-slab for commit-name instead of commit->util
 + name-rev: use commit-slab for rev-name instead of commit->util
 + bisect.c: use commit-slab for commit weight instead of commit->util
 + revision.c: use commit-slab for show_source
 + sequencer.c: use commit-slab to associate todo items to commits
 + sequencer.c: use commit-slab to mark seen commits
 + shallow.c: use commit-slab for commit depth instead of commit->util
 + describe: use commit-slab for commit names instead of commit->util
 + blame: use commit-slab for blame suspects instead of commit->util
 + commit-slab: support shared commit-slab
 + commit-slab.h: code split

 The in-core "commit" object had an all-purpose "void *util" field,
 which was tricky to use especially in library-ish part of the
 code.  All of the existing uses of the field has been migrated to a
 more dedicated "commit-slab" mechanism and the field is eliminated.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* nd/diff-apply-ita (2018-05-29) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-30 at f98728de81)
 + apply: add --intent-to-add
 + t2203: add a test about "diff HEAD" case
 + diff: turn --ita-invisible-in-index on by default
 + diff: ignore --ita-[in]visible-in-index when diffing worktree-to-tree

 "git diff" compares the index and the working tree.  For paths
 added with intent-to-add bit, the command shows the full contents
 of them as added, but the paths themselves were not marked as new
 files.  They are now shown as new by default.

 "git apply" learned the "--intent-to-add" option so that an
 otherwise working-tree-only application of a patch will add new
 paths to the index marked with the "intent-to-add" bit.

 Will cook in 'next'.

 Will merge to and cook in 'next'.


* pc/submodule-helper-foreach (2018-05-11) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-22 at f22659ad46)

 The bulk of "git submodule foreach" has been rewritten in C.

 Will cook in 'next'.

 iterations of a topic has been rewritten and made into a built-in
 command.

 Expecting a reroll.

 . grep.c: expose matched column in match_line()
 . Documentation/config.txt: camel-case lineNumber for consistency
 (this branch is used by tb/grep-only-matching.)

 "git grep" learned the "--column" option that gives not just the
 line number but the column number of the hit.

 Expecting a reroll.

* ds/generation-numbers (2018-05-22) 11 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-24 at 56fc38a1b6)
 + commit-graph.txt: update design document
 + merge: check config before loading commits

 history traversal.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* jk/branch-l-0-deprecation (2018-05-25) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-30 at a94574dfd5)
 + branch: customize "-l" warning in list mode
 + branch: issue "-l" deprecation warning after pager starts
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-11 at 9b2b0305dd)
 + branch: deprecate "-l" option
 + t: switch "branch -l" to "branch --create-reflog"
 + t3200: unset core.logallrefupdates when testing reflog creation
 (this branch is used by jk/branch-l-1-removal and jk/branch-l-2-reincarnation.)

 The "-l" option in "git branch -l" is an unfortunate short-hand for
 "--create-reflog", but many users, both old and new, somehow expect
 it to be something else, perhaps "--list".  This step deprecates
 the short-hand and warns about the future removal of the it when it
 is used.

 Will cook in 'next'.
 Perhaps merge to 'master' immediately after 2.18 release?


* jk/branch-l-1-removal (2018-05-30) 1 commit
 - branch: drop deprecated "-l" option
 (this branch is used by jk/branch-l-2-reincarnation; uses jk/branch-l-0-deprecation.)

 Following the "git branch -l" deprecation, the short-hand is removed.

 Will keep in 'pu'.


* jk/branch-l-2-reincarnation (2018-05-30) 1 commit
 - branch: make "-l" a synonym for "--list"
 (this branch uses jk/branch-l-0-deprecation and jk/branch-l-1-removal.)

 Following the "git branch -l" removal, "-l" is resurrected as a
 short-hand for "--list".

 Will keep in 'pu'.

* js/runtime-prefix-windows (2018-03-27) 5 commits
 . mingw/msvc: use the new-style RUNTIME_PREFIX helper
 . exec_cmd: provide a new-style RUNTIME_PREFIX helper for Windows
 . exec_cmd: RUNTIME_PREFIX on some POSIX systems
 . Makefile: add Perl runtime prefix support
 . Makefile: generate Perl header from template file

 The Windows port was the first that allowed Git to be installed
 anywhere by having its components refer to each other with relative
 pathnames.  The recent dj/runtime-prefix topic extends the idea to
 other platforms, and its approach has been adopted back in the
 Windows port.

 Ejected, as the parent topic dj/runtime-prefix covers Windows now.


* bp/fsexcludes (2018-04-16) 2 commits
 . fsmonitor: switch to use new fsexcludes logic and remove unused untracked cache based logic
 . fsexcludes: add a programmatic way to exclude files from git's working directory traversal logic

 Can we have a few lines summary here, just like we have for other
 topic ;-) I personally take the overlong title of these commits as
 a sign that they can further be simplified and cleaned up by
 splitting, focusing the scope, etc.

 Retracted.

* ma/doc-expand-tabs (2018-05-02) 1 commit
 . revisions.txt: expand tabs to spaces in diagram

 Fix one instance of asciidoctor's misformatting by expanding a tab
 into spaces in a literal block.

 Discarded.
 This approach is less maintainable than the approach taken by
 bc/asciidoctor-tab-width topic.
