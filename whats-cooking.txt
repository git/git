What's cooking in git.git (Feb 2017, #06; Tue, 21)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

The tip of the 'master' is still at -rc2 but with a git-svn update
from Eric.  I'd like to get pull requests for gitk and git-gui
updates soonish, if we are to have one during this cycle.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* jk/tempfile-ferror-fclose-confusion (2017-02-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-02-21 at 479ba0131f)
 + tempfile: set errno to a known value before calling ferror()

 A caller of tempfile API that uses stdio interface to write to
 files may ignore errors while writing, which is detected when
 tempfile is closed (with a call to ferror()).  By that time, the
 original errno that may have told us what went wrong is likely to
 be long gone and was overwritten by an irrelevant value.
 close_tempfile() now resets errno to EIO to make errno at least
 predictable.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* ah/doc-ls-files-quotepath (2017-02-20) 1 commit
 - Documentation: link git-ls-files to core.quotePath variable

 Documentation for "git ls-files" did not refer to core.quotePath

 Needs review.


* dr/doc-check-ref-format-normalize (2017-02-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-02-21 at 5e88b7a93d)
 + git-check-ref-format: clarify documentation for --normalize

 Doc update.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* gp/document-dotfiles-in-templates-are-not-copied (2017-02-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-02-21 at bbfa2bb7d4)
 + init: document dotfiles exclusion on template copy

 Doc update.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* jc/config-case-cmdline (2017-02-21) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-02-21 at 354f023a3a)
 + config: reject invalid VAR in 'git -c VAR=VAL command'
 + config: preserve <subsection> case for one-shot config on the command line

 The code to parse "git -c VAR=VAL cmd" and set configuration
 variable for the duration of cmd had two small bugs, which have
 been fixed.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* jh/memihash-opt (2017-02-17) 5 commits
 - name-hash: remember previous dir_entry during lazy_init_name_hash
 - name-hash: specify initial size for istate.dir_hash table
 - name-hash: precompute hash values during preload-index
 - hashmap: allow memihash computation to be continued
 - name-hash: eliminate duplicate memihash call

 Expecting an update for perf?


* km/delete-ref-reflog-message (2017-02-20) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-02-21 at 4ee4ce3f64)
 + branch: record creation of renamed branch in HEAD's log
 + rename_ref: replace empty message in HEAD's log
 + update-ref: pass reflog message to delete_ref()
 + delete_ref: accept a reflog message argument

 "git update-ref -d" and other operations to delete references did
 not leave any entry in HEAD's reflog when the reference being
 deleted was the current branch.  This is not a problem in practice
 because you do not want to delete the branch you are currently on,
 but caused renaming of the current branch to something else not to
 be logged in a useful way.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* nd/prune-in-worktree (2017-02-19) 15 commits
 - rev-list: expose and document --single-worktree
 - revision.c: --reflog add HEAD reflog from all worktrees
 - files-backend: make reflog iterator go through per-worktree reflog
 - refs: add refs_for_each_reflog[_ent]()
 - revision.c: --all adds HEAD from all worktrees
 - refs: remove dead for_each_*_submodule()
 - revision.c: use refs_for_each*() instead of for_each_*_submodule()
 - refs: add a refs_for_each_in() and friends
 - refs: add refs_for_each_ref()
 - refs: add refs_head_ref()
 - refs: add refs_read_ref[_full]()
 - refs: move submodule slash stripping code to get_submodule_ref_store
 - revision.c: --indexed-objects add objects from all worktrees
 - revision.c: refactor add_index_objects_to_pending()
 - revision.h: new flag in struct rev_info wrt. worktree-related refs
 (this branch uses mh/ref-remove-empty-directory, mh/submodule-hash, nd/files-backend-git-dir and nd/worktree-kill-parse-ref.)

 "git gc" and friends when multiple worktrees are used off of a
 single repository did not consider the index and per-worktree refs
 of other worktrees as the root for reachability traversal, making
 objects that are in use only in other worktrees to be subject to
 garbage collection.


* mm/fetch-show-error-message-on-unadvertised-object (2017-02-21) 1 commit
 - fetch: print an error when declining to request an unadvertised object

 "git fetch" that requests a commit by object name, when the other
 side does not allow such an request, failed without much
 explanation.

 Expecting a split series?


* rl/remote-allow-missing-branch-name-merge (2017-02-21) 1 commit
 - remote: ignore failure to remove missing branch.<name>.merge

 "git remote rm X", when a branch has remote X configured as the
 value of its branch.*.remote, tried to remove branch.*.remote and
 branch.*.merge and failed if either is unset.

 Will merge to and then cook in 'next'.

 . worktree move: refuse to move worktrees with submodules
 . worktree move: accept destination as directory
 . worktree move: new command
 . worktree.c: add update_worktree_location()

* ls/filter-process-delayed (2017-01-08) 1 commit
 . convert: add "status=delayed" to filter process protocol

 Ejected, as does not build when merged to 'pu'.


* sh/grep-tree-obj-tweak-output (2017-01-20) 2 commits
 - grep: use '/' delimiter for paths
 - grep: only add delimiter if there isn't one already

 "git grep", when fed a tree-ish as an input, shows each hit
 prefixed with "<tree-ish>:<path>:<lineno>:".  As <tree-ish> is
 almost always either a commit or a tag that points at a commit, the
 early part of the output "<tree-ish>:<path>" can be used as the
 name of the blob and given to "git show".  When <tree-ish> is a
 tree given in the extended SHA-1 syntax (e.g. "<commit>:", or
 "<commit>:<dir>"), however, this results in a string that does not
 name a blob (e.g. "<commit>::<path>" or "<commit>:<dir>:<path>").
 "git grep" has been taught to be a bit more intelligent about these
 cases and omit a colon (in the former case) or use slash (in the
 latter case) to produce "<commit>:<path>" and
 "<commit>:<dir>/<path>" that can be used as the name of a blob.

 Expecting a reroll?  Is this good enough with known limitations?


* jc/diff-b-m (2015-02-23) 5 commits
 . WIPWIP
 . WIP: diff-b-m
 - diffcore-rename: allow easier debugging
 - diffcore-rename.c: add locate_rename_src()
 - diffcore-break: allow debugging

 "git diff -B -M" produced incorrect patch when the postimage of a
 completely rewritten file is similar to the preimage of a removed
 file; such a resulting file must not be expressed as a rename from
 other place.

 The fix in this patch is broken, unfortunately.

 Will discard.

* vn/xdiff-func-context (2017-01-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-02-21 at 838eab8d93)
 + xdiff -W: relax end-of-file function detection

 "git diff -W" has been taught to handle the case where a new
 function is added at the end of the file better.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* nd/worktree-kill-parse-ref (2017-02-19) 5 commits
 - refs: kill set_worktree_head_symref()
 - refs: add refs_create_symref()
 - worktree.c: kill parse_ref() in favor of refs_resolve_ref_unsafe()
 - refs.c: add refs_resolve_ref_unsafe()
 - refs: introduce get_worktree_ref_store()
 (this branch is used by nd/prune-in-worktree; uses mh/ref-remove-empty-directory, mh/submodule-hash and nd/files-backend-git-dir.)

 (hopefully) a beginning of safer "git worktree" that is resistant
 to "gc".

 Needs review.


* nd/files-backend-git-dir (2017-02-19) 17 commits
 - refs: rename get_ref_store() to get_submodule_ref_store() and make it public
 - files-backend: remove submodule_allowed from files_downcast()
 - refs: move submodule code out of files-backend.c
 - path.c: move some code out of strbuf_git_path_submodule()
 - refs.c: make get_main_ref_store() public and use it
 - refs.c: kill register_ref_store(), add register_submodule_ref_store()
 - refs.c: flatten get_ref_store() a bit
 - refs: rename lookup_ref_store() to lookup_submodule_ref_store()
 - refs.c: introduce get_main_ref_store()
 - files-backend: remove the use of git_path()
 - refs.c: share is_per_worktree_ref() to files-backend.c
 - files-backend: replace *git_path*() with files_path()
 - files-backend: add files_path()
 - files-backend: convert git_path() to strbuf_git_path()
 - refs-internal.c: make files_log_ref_write() static
 - Merge branch 'mh/ref-remove-empty-directory' into nd/files-backend-git-dir
 - Merge branch 'mh/submodule-hash' into nd/files-backend-git-dir
 (this branch is used by nd/prune-in-worktree and nd/worktree-kill-parse-ref; uses mh/ref-remove-empty-directory and mh/submodule-hash.)

 The "submodule" specific field in the ref_store structure is
 replaced with a more generic "gitdir" that can later be used also
 when dealing with ref_store that represents the set of refs visible
 from the other worktrees.

 Needs review.


* nd/clean-preserve-errno-in-warning (2017-02-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-02-16 at c0802f7627)
 + clean: use warning_errno() when appropriate

 Some warning() messages from "git clean" were updated to show the
 errno from failed system calls.

 Will cook in 'next'.

 - lib-submodule-update.sh: reorder create_lib_submodule_repo

 "git checkout" is taught --recurse-submodules option.

 Needs review.


* jh/preload-index-skip-skip (2017-02-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-02-16 at 39077062f9)
 + preload-index: avoid lstat for skip-worktree items

 The preload-index code has been taught not to bother with the index
 entries that are paths that are not checked out by "sparse checkout".

 Will cook in 'next'.


* tg/stash-push (2017-02-19) 6 commits
 - stash: allow pathspecs in the no verb form
 - stash: use stash_push for no verb form
 - stash: teach 'push' (and 'create_stash') to honor pathspec
 - stash: refactor stash_create
 - stash: add test for the create command line arguments

 Allow "git stash" to take pathspec so that the local changes can be
 stashed away only partially.

 Needs review.

* jk/grep-no-index-fix (2017-02-14) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-02-16 at c84c927fa8)
 + grep: treat revs the same for --untracked as for --no-index
 + grep: do not diagnose misspelt revs with --no-index
 + grep: avoid resolving revision names in --no-index case
 + grep: fix "--" rev/pathspec disambiguation
 + grep: re-order rev-parsing loop
 + grep: do not unnecessarily query repo for "--"
 + grep: move thread initialization a little lower

 The code to parse the command line "git grep <patterns>... <rev>
 [[--] <pathspec>...]" has been cleaned up, and a handful of bugs
 have been fixed (e.g. we used to check "--" if it is a rev).

 Will cook in 'next'.


* jk/show-branch-lift-name-len-limit (2017-02-15) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-02-16 at 40d22f5f34)
 + show-branch: use skip_prefix to drop magic numbers
 + show-branch: store resolved head in heap buffer
 + show-branch: drop head_len variable

 "git show-branch" expected there were only very short branch names
 in the repository and used a fixed-length buffer to hold them
 without checking for overflow.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* lt/oneline-decoration-at-end (2017-02-21) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-02-21 at 35c7731ee3)
 + log: fix regression to "--source" when "--decorate" was updated
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-02-16 at 5854e58811)
 + show decorations at the end of the line

 The output from "git log --oneline --decorate" has been updated to
 show the extra information at the end of the line, not near the
 front.

* jn/remote-helpers-with-git-dir (2017-02-14) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-02-16 at c093c543c4)
 + remote helpers: avoid blind fall-back to ".git" when setting GIT_DIR
 + remote: avoid reading $GIT_DIR config in non-repo

 "git ls-remote" and "git archive --remote" are designed to work
 without being in a directory under Git's control.  However, recent
 updates revealed that we randomly look into a directory called
 .git/ without actually doing necessary set-up when working in a
 repository.  Stop doing so.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* jk/alternate-ref-optim (2017-02-08) 11 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-02-10 at f26f32cff6)
 + receive-pack: avoid duplicates between our refs and alternates
 + receive-pack: treat namespace .have lines like alternates
 + receive-pack: fix misleading namespace/.have comment
 + receive-pack: use oidset to de-duplicate .have lines
 + add oidset API
 + fetch-pack: cache results of for_each_alternate_ref
 + for_each_alternate_ref: replace transport code with for-each-ref
 + for_each_alternate_ref: pass name/oid instead of ref struct
 + for_each_alternate_ref: use strbuf for path allocation
 + for_each_alternate_ref: stop trimming trailing slashes
 + for_each_alternate_ref: handle failure from real_pathdup()

 Optimizes resource usage while enumerating refs from alternate
 object store, to help receiving end of "push" that hosts a
 repository with many "forks".

* lt/pathspec-negative (2017-02-10) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-02-10 at 8ea7874076)
 + pathspec: don't error out on all-exclusionary pathspec patterns
 + pathspec magic: add '^' as alias for '!'

 The "negative" pathspec feature was somewhat more cumbersome to use
 than necessary in that its short-hand used "!" which needed to be
 escaped from shells, and it required "exclude from what?" specified.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* js/rebase-helper (2017-02-09) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-02-14 at ae2474048e)
 + rebase -i: use the rebase--helper builtin
 + rebase--helper: add a builtin helper for interactive rebases

 "git rebase -i" starts using the recently updated "sequencer" code.

 Will cook in 'next'.
 The change itself is small, but what it enables is rather a large
 body of new code.  We are getting there ;-)


* mh/submodule-hash (2017-02-13) 9 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-02-14 at 43f2dcbe29)
 + read_loose_refs(): read refs using resolve_ref_recursively()
 + files_ref_store::submodule: use NULL for the main repository
 + base_ref_store_init(): remove submodule argument
 + refs: push the submodule attribute down
 + refs: store submodule ref stores in a hashmap
 + register_ref_store(): new function
 + refs: remove some unnecessary handling of submodule == ""
 + refs: make some ref_store lookup functions private
 + refs: reorder some function definitions
 (this branch is used by nd/files-backend-git-dir, nd/prune-in-worktree and nd/worktree-kill-parse-ref.)

 Code and design clean-up for the refs API.

  (merged to 'next' on 2017-02-16 at 8f48e1b405)
 + gc: ignore old gc.log files

 A "gc.log" file left by a backgrounded "gc --auto" disables further
 automatic gc; it has been taught to run at least once a day (by
 default) by ignoring a stale "gc.log" file that is too old.

* js/git-path-in-subdir (2017-02-17) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-02-17 at b3c3b2dce6)
 + rev-parse: fix several options when running in a subdirectory
 + rev-parse tests: add tests executed from a subdirectory

 The "--git-path", "--git-common-dir", and "--shared-index-path"
 options of "git rev-parse" did not produce usable output.  They are
 now updated to show the path to the correct file, relative to where
 the caller is.

 Deletion of a branch "foo/bar" could remove .git/refs/heads/foo
 once there no longer is any other branch whose name begins with
 "foo/", but we didn't do so so far.  Now we do.

  (merged to 'next' on 2017-02-10 at 3968b3a58b)
 + tag: generate useful reflog message

 "git tag", because refs/tags/* doesn't keep reflog by default, did
 not leave useful message when adding a new entry to reflog.

 - squash! completion: fill COMPREPLY directly when completing refs
 - completion: fill COMPREPLY directly when completing refs
 - completion: list only matching symbolic and pseudorefs when completing refs
 - completion: let 'for-each-ref' sort remote branches for 'checkout' DWIMery
 - completion: let 'for-each-ref' filter remote branches for 'checkout' DWIMery
 - completion: let 'for-each-ref' strip the remote name from remote branches
 - completion: let 'for-each-ref' and 'ls-remote' filter matching refs
 - completion: don't disambiguate short refs
 - completion: don't disambiguate tags and branches
 - completion: support excluding full refs
 - completion: support completing full refs after '--option=refs/<TAB>'
 - completion: wrap __git_refs() for better option parsing
 - completion: remove redundant __gitcomp_nl() options from _git_commit()
 (this branch uses sg/completion.)

 The refs completion for large number of refs has been sped up,
 partly by giving up disambiguating ambiguous refs and partly by
 eliminating most of the shell processing between 'git for-each-ref'
 and 'ls-remote' and Bash's completion facility.

 Will hold.

 + merge-recursive: make "CONFLICT (rename/delete)" message show both paths

 When "git merge" detects a path that is renamed in one history
 while the other history deleted (or modified) it, it now reports
 both paths to help the user understand what is going on in the two
 histories being merged.

* ps/urlmatch-wildcard (2017-02-01) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-02-10 at 2ed9ea48ee)

 + urlmatch: include host in urlmatch ranking
 + urlmatch: split host and port fields in `struct url_info`
 + urlmatch: enable normalization of URLs with globs
 + mailmap: add Patrick Steinhardt's work address

 The <url> part in "http.<url>.<variable>" configuration variable
 can now be spelled with '*' that serves as wildcard.
 E.g. "http.https://*.example.com.proxy" can be used to specify the
 proxy used for https://a.example.com, https://b.example.com, etc.,
 i.e. any host in the example.com domain.

 + connect.c: stop conflating ssh command names and overrides
 + connect: Add the envvar GIT_SSH_VARIANT and ssh.variant config
 + git_connect(): factor out SSH variant handling
 + connect: rename tortoiseplink and putty variables
 + connect: handle putty/plink also in GIT_SSH_COMMAND

 The command line options for ssh invocation needs to be tweaked for
 some implementations of SSH (e.g. PuTTY plink wants "-P <port>"
 while OpenSSH wants "-p <port>" to specify port to connect to), and
 the variant was guessed when GIT_SSH environment variable is used
 to specify it.  The logic to guess now applies to the command
 specified by the newer GIT_SSH_COMMAND and also core.sshcommand
 configuration variable, and comes with an escape hatch for users to
 deal with misdetected cases.

 + name-rev: add support to exclude refs by pattern match
 + name-rev: extend --refs to accept multiple patterns
 + doc: add documentation for OPT_STRING_LIST

 "git describe" and "git name-rev" have been taught to take more
 than one refname patterns to restrict the set of refs to base their
 naming output on, and also learned to take negative patterns to
 name refs not to be used for naming via their "--exclude" option.

 + setup_git_env: avoid blind fall-back to ".git"

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2016-10-26

 This is the endgame of the topic to avoid blindly falling back to
 ".git" when the setup sequence said we are _not_ in Git repository.
 A corner case that happens to work right now may be broken by a
 call to die("BUG").
