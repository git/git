What's cooking in git.git (Mar 2014, #07; Fri, 28)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.

More topics merged to 'master', many of which are fallouts from GSoC
microprojects.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

[Graduated to "master"]

* ah/doc-gitk-config (2014-03-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-20 at d671b60)
 + Documentation/gitk: document the location of the configulation file


* bg/rebase-off-of-previous-branch (2014-03-19) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-21 at 916b759)
 + rebase: allow "-" short-hand for the previous branch

 "git rebase" learned to interpret a lone "-" as "@{-1}", the
 branch that we were previously on.


* bp/commit-p-editor (2014-03-18) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-21 at 23b6b06)
 + run-command: mark run_hook_with_custom_index as deprecated
 + merge hook tests: fix and update tests
 + merge: fix GIT_EDITOR override for commit hook
 + commit: fix patch hunk editing with "commit -p -m"
 + test patch hunk editing with "commit -p -m"
 + merge hook tests: use 'test_must_fail' instead of '!'
 + merge hook tests: fix missing '&&' in test

 When it is not necessary to edit a commit log message (e.g. "git
 commit -m" is given a message without specifying "-e"), we used to
 disable the spawning of the editor by overriding GIT_EDITOR, but
 this means all the uses of the editor, other than to edit the
 commit log message, are also affected.


* fr/add-interactive-argv-array (2014-03-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-20 at 9d65f3d)
 + add: use struct argv_array in run_add_interactive()


* jk/pack-bitmap (2014-03-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-20 at bba6246)
 + pack-objects: turn off bitmaps when skipping objects

 Instead of dying when asked to (re)pack with the reachability
 bitmap when a bitmap cannot be built, just (re)pack without
 producing a bitmap in such a case, with a warning.


* jk/pack-bitmap-progress (2014-03-17) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-20 at c7a83f9)
 + pack-objects: show reused packfile objects in "Counting objects"
 + pack-objects: show progress for reused packfiles

 The progress output while repacking and transferring objects showed
 an apparent large silence while writing the objects out of existing
 packfiles, when the reachability bitmap was in use.


* jk/subtree-prefix (2014-03-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-20 at 81367fa)
 + subtree: initialize "prefix" variable

 A stray environment variable $prefix could have leaked into and
 affected the behaviour of the "subtree" script.


* ys/fsck-commit-parsing (2014-03-19) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-21 at 2728983)
 + fsck.c:fsck_commit(): use skip_prefix() to verify and skip constant
 + fsck.c:fsck_ident(): ident points at a const string

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* jc/apply-ignore-whitespace (2014-03-26) 1 commit
 - apply --ignore-space-change: lines with and without leading whitespaces do not match

 An RFC.  "--ignore-space-change" option of "git apply" ignored the
 spaces at the beginning of line too aggressively, which is
 inconsistent with the option of the same name "diff" and "git diff"
 have.

 Will hold.


* jc/rev-parse-argh-dashed-multi-words (2014-03-24) 3 commits
 - parse-options: make sure argh string does not have SP or _
 - update-index: teach --cacheinfo a new syntax "mode,sha1,path"
 - parse-options: multi-word argh should use dash to separate words
 (this branch uses ib/rev-parse-parseopt-argh.)

 Make sure that the help text given to describe the "<param>" part
 of the "git cmd --option=<param>" does not contain SP or _,
 e.g. "--gpg-sign=<key-id>" option for "git commit" is not spelled
 as "--gpg-sign=<key id>".

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/commit-dates-parsing-fix (2014-03-26) 1 commit
 - t4212: loosen far-in-future test for AIX

 I think we agreed that a simpler test would be a better way
 forward.


* mr/msvc-link-with-invalidcontinue (2014-03-28) 1 commit
 - MSVC: link in invalidcontinue.obj for better POSIX compatibility

 Will merge to 'next'.


* mr/msvc-link-with-lcurl (2014-03-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-28 at 3281dab)
 + MSVC: allow linking with the cURL library

 Will merge to 'master'.


* wt/doc-submodule-name-path-confusion-1 (2014-03-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-28 at 225f241)
 + doc: submodule.* config are keyed by submodule names

 Will merge to 'master'.


* wt/doc-submodule-name-path-confusion-2 (2014-03-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-28 at ec5bcf3)
 + doc: submodule.*.branch config is keyed by name

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ep/shell-command-substitution (2014-03-25) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-28 at 99a512a)
 + git-am.sh: use the $(...) construct for command substitution
 + check-builtins.sh: use the $(...) construct for command substitution

 Will merge to 'master'.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* tr/merge-recursive-index-only (2014-02-05) 3 commits
 - merge-recursive: -Xindex-only to leave worktree unchanged
 - merge-recursive: internal flag to avoid touching the worktree
 - merge-recursive: remove dead conditional in update_stages()
 (this branch is used by tr/remerge-diff.)

 Will hold.


* tr/remerge-diff (2014-02-26) 5 commits
 . log --remerge-diff: show what the conflict resolution changed
 . name-hash: allow dir hashing even when !ignore_case
 . merge-recursive: allow storing conflict hunks in index
 . revision: fold all merge diff variants into an enum merge_diff_mode
 . combine-diff: do not pass revs->dense_combined_merges redundantly
 (this branch uses tr/merge-recursive-index-only.)

 "log -p" output learns a new way to let users inspect a merge
 commit by showing the differences between the automerged result
 with conflicts the person who recorded the merge would have seen
 and the final conflict resolution that was recorded in the merge.

 RFC.  This latest round clashes with the kb/fast-hashmap topic in
 'master'.


* sz/mingw-index-pack-threaded (2014-03-19) 1 commit
 - Enable index-pack threading in msysgit.

 Still under discussion among Windows folks.  A failure report
 exists ($gmane/245170).


* bc/blame-crlf-test (2014-02-18) 1 commit
 - blame: add a failing test for a CRLF issue.

 I have a feeling that a fix for this should be fairly isolated and
 trivial (it should be just the matter of paying attention to the
 crlf settings when synthesizing the fake commit)---perhaps somebody
 can squash in a fix to this?


* jk/makefile (2014-02-05) 16 commits
 - FIXUP
 - move LESS/LV pager environment to Makefile
 - Makefile: teach scripts to include make variables
 - FIXUP
 - Makefile: auto-build C strings from make variables
 - Makefile: drop *_SQ variables
 - FIXUP
 - Makefile: add c-quote helper function
 - Makefile: introduce sq function for shell-quoting
 - Makefile: always create files via make-var
 - Makefile: store GIT-* sentinel files in MAKE/
 - Makefile: prefer printf to echo for GIT-*
 - Makefile: use tempfile/mv strategy for GIT-*
 - Makefile: introduce make-var helper function
 - Makefile: fix git-instaweb dependency on gitweb
 - Makefile: drop USE_GETTEXT_SCHEME from GIT-CFLAGS

 Simplify the Makefile rules and macros that exist primarily for
 quoting purposes, and make it easier to robustly express the
 dependency rules.

 Expecting a reroll.


* kb/fast-hashmap-pack-struct (2014-02-24) 1 commit
 - hashmap.h: make sure map entries are tightly packed

 I am inclined to drop this; an alternative is to replace it with
 the "more portable" one that uses #pragma, which I am willing to
 try doing so on 'pu', though.


* po/everyday-doc (2014-01-27) 1 commit
 - Make 'git help everyday' work

 This may make the said command to emit something, but the source is
 not meant to be formatted into a manual pages to begin with, and
 also its contents are a bit stale.  It may be a good first step in
 the right direction, but needs more work to at least get the
 mark-up right before public consumption.

 Will hold.


* jk/branch-at-publish-rebased (2014-01-17) 5 commits
 - t1507 (rev-parse-upstream): fix typo in test title
 - implement @{publish} shorthand
 - branch_get: provide per-branch pushremote pointers
 - branch_get: return early on error
 - sha1_name: refactor upstream_mark

 Give an easier access to the tracking branches from "other" side in
 a triangular workflow by introducing B@{publish} that works in a
 similar way to how B@{upstream} does.

 Meant to be used as a basis for whatever Ram wants to build on.

 Will hold.


* rb/merge-prepare-commit-msg-hook (2014-01-10) 4 commits
 - merge: drop unused arg from abort_commit method signature
 - merge: make prepare_to_commit responsible for write_merge_state
 - t7505: ensure cleanup after hook blocks merge
 - t7505: add missing &&

 Expose more merge states (e.g. $GIT_DIR/MERGE_MODE) to hooks that
 run during "git merge".  The log message stresses too much on one
 hook, prepare-commit-msg, but it would equally apply to other hooks
 like post-merge, I think.

 Waiting for a reroll.


* jl/submodule-recursive-checkout (2013-12-26) 5 commits
 - Teach checkout to recursively checkout submodules
 - submodule: teach unpack_trees() to update submodules
 - submodule: teach unpack_trees() to repopulate submodules
 - submodule: teach unpack_trees() to remove submodule contents
 - submodule: prepare for recursive checkout of submodules

 Expecting a reroll.


* jc/graph-post-root-gap (2013-12-30) 3 commits
 - WIP: document what we want at the end
 - graph: remove unused code a bit
 - graph: stuff the current commit into graph->columns[]

 This was primarily a RFH ($gmane/239580).


* hv/submodule-ignore-fix (2013-12-06) 4 commits
 - disable complete ignorance of submodules for index <-> HEAD diff
 - always show committed submodules in summary after commit
 - teach add -f option for ignored submodules
 - fix 'git add' to skip submodules configured as ignored

 Teach "git add" to be consistent with "git status" when changes to
 submodules are set to be ignored, to avoid surprises after checking
 with "git status" to see there isn't any change to be further added
 and then see that "git add ." adds changes to them.

 I think a reroll is coming, so this may need to be replaced, but I
 needed some practice with heavy conflict resolution.  It conflicts
 with two changes to "git add" that have been scheduled for Git 2.0
 quite badly, and I think I got the resolution right this time.

 Waiting for a reroll.


* np/pack-v4 (2013-09-18) 90 commits
 . packv4-parse.c: add tree offset caching
 . t1050: replace one instance of show-index with verify-pack
 . index-pack, pack-objects: allow creating .idx v2 with .pack v4
 . unpack-objects: decode v4 trees
 . unpack-objects: allow to save processed bytes to a buffer
 - ...

 Nico and Duy advancing the eternal vaporware pack-v4.  This is here
 primarily for wider distribution of the preview edition.

 Temporarily ejected from 'pu', to try out jk/pack-bitmap, which
 this topic conflicts with.


* tg/perf-lib-test-perf-cleanup (2013-09-19) 2 commits
 - perf-lib: add test_perf_cleanup target
 - perf-lib: split starting the test from the execution

 Add test_perf_cleanup shell function to the perf suite, that allows
 the script writers to define a test with a clean-up action.

 Will hold.


* jc/format-patch (2013-04-22) 2 commits
 - format-patch: --inline-single
 - format-patch: rename "no_inline" field

 A new option to send a single patch to the standard output to be
 appended at the bottom of a message.  I personally have no need for
 this, but it was easy enough to cobble together.  Tests, docs and
 stripping out more MIMEy stuff are left as exercises to interested
 parties.


* jc/show-branch (2014-03-24) 5 commits
 - show-branch: use commit slab to represent bitflags of arbitrary width
 - show-branch.c: remove "all_mask"
 - show-branch.c: abstract out "flags" operation
 - show-branch.c: lift all_mask/all_revs to a global static
 - show-branch.c: update comment style

 Waiting for the final step to lift the hard-limit before sending it out.

* ca/doc-config-third-party (2014-03-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-25 at 731e011)

 Will merge to 'master'.


* js/userdiff-cc (2014-03-21) 10 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-25 at 8c0e585)

 + t4018: test cases showing that the cpp pattern misses many anchor points
 + t4018: test cases for the built-in cpp pattern
 + t4018: reduce test files for pattern compilation tests

  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-25 at b32e3ad)

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ib/rev-parse-parseopt-argh (2014-03-23) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-25 at d9083ed)
 + t1502: protect runs of SPs used in the indentation
 + rev-parse --parseopt: option argument name hints
 (this branch is used by jc/rev-parse-argh-dashed-multi-words.)

 Teaches the "rev-parse --parseopt" mechanism used by scripted
 Porcelains to parse command line options and give help text how to
 supply argv-help (the placeholder string for an option parameter,
 e.g. "key-id" in "--gpg-sign=<key-id>").

 Will merge to 'master'.


* rs/pickaxe-i (2014-03-24) 10 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-25 at 3b6f21f)
 + pickaxe: simplify kwset loop in contains()
 + pickaxe: call strlen only when necessary in diffcore_pickaxe_count()
 + pickaxe: move pickaxe() after pickaxe_match()
 + pickaxe: merge diffcore_pickaxe_grep() and diffcore_pickaxe_count() into diffcore_pickaxe()
 + pickaxe: honor -i when used with -S and --pickaxe-regex
 + t4209: use helper functions to test --author
 + t4209: use helper functions to test --grep
 + t4209: factor out helper function test_log_icase()
 + t4209: factor out helper function test_log()
 + t4209: set up expectations up front

 Allow the options -i/--regexp-ignore-case, --pickaxe-regex, and -S
 to be used together and work as expected to perform a pickaxe
 search using case-insensitive regular expression matching.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* an/branch-config-message (2014-03-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-26 at 26f9741)
 + branch.c: install_branch_config: simplify if chain

 Will merge to 'master'.


* as/grep-fullname-config (2014-03-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-28 at 810a076)
 + grep: add grep.fullName config variable

 Add a configuration variable to force --full-name to be default for
 "git grep".

 This may cause regressions on scripted users that do not expect
 this new behaviour.

 Will hold.


* nd/gc-aggressive (2014-03-17) 4 commits

 - gc --aggressive: make --depth configurable
 - pack-objects: support --keep

* cn/fetch-prune-overlapping-destination (2014-03-26) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-28 at 954513a)
 + fetch: handle overlaping refspecs on --prune
 + fetch: add a failing test for prunning with overlapping refspecs

 Protect refs in a hierarchy that can come from more than one remote
 hierarcies from incorrect removal by "git fetch --prune".

 Since I didn't get any responses to my earlier "Comments?", I ended
 up reading it myself again and found a small leak, whose fix has
 been squashed in to the tip commit.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* nd/multiple-work-trees (2014-03-25) 28 commits
 - count-objects: report unused files in $GIT_DIR/repos/...
 - gc: support prune --repos
 - gc: style change -- no SP before closing bracket
 - prune: strategies for linked checkouts
 - checkout: detach if the branch is already checked out elsewhere
 - checkout: clean up half-prepared directories in --to mode
 - checkout: support checking out into a new working directory
 - use new wrapper write_file() for simple file writing
 - wrapper.c: wrapper to open a file, fprintf then close
 - setup.c: support multi-checkout repo setup

 - git-sh-setup.sh: use rev-parse --git-path to get $GIT_DIR/objects
 - $GIT_COMMON_DIR: a new environment variable
 - commit: use SEQ_DIR instead of hardcoding "sequencer"
 - fast-import: use git_path() for accessing .git dir instead of get_git_dir()
 - reflog: avoid constructing .lock path with git_path
 - *.sh: respect $GIT_INDEX_FILE
 - git_path(): be aware of file relocation in $GIT_DIR
 - path.c: group git_path(), git_pathdup() and strbuf_git_path() together
 - path.c: rename vsnpath() to do_git_path()
 - git_snpath(): retire and replace with strbuf_git_path()
 - path.c: make get_pathname() call sites return const char *

 A replacement for contrib/workdir/git-new-workdir that does not

 by making the borrowee and borrowers aware of each other.


* ks/tree-diff-nway (2014-03-27) 19 commits
 - combine-diff: speed it up, by using multiparent diff tree-walker directly
 - tree-diff: rework diff_tree() to generate diffs for multiparent cases as well
 - Portable alloca for Git
 - tree-diff: reuse base str(buf) memory on sub-tree recursion
 - tree-diff: no need to call "full" diff_tree_sha1 from show_path()
 - tree-diff: rework diff_tree interface to be sha1 based
 - tree-diff: diff_tree() should now be static
 - tree-diff: remove special-case diff-emitting code for empty-tree cases
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-25 at cfcbdac)
 + tree-diff: simplify tree_entry_pathcmp
 + tree-diff: show_path prototype is not needed anymore
 + tree-diff: rename compare_tree_entry -> tree_entry_pathcmp
 + tree-diff: move all action-taking code out of compare_tree_entry()
 + tree-diff: don't assume compare_tree_entry() returns -1,0,1
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-21 at d872679)
 + tree-diff: consolidate code for emitting diffs and recursion in one place
 + tree-diff: show_tree() is not needed
 + tree-diff: no need to pass match to skip_uninteresting()
 + tree-diff: no need to manually verify that there is no mode change for a path
 + combine-diff: move changed-paths scanning logic into its own function
 + combine-diff: move show_log_first logic/action out of paths scanning

 Instead of running N pair-wise diff-trees when inspecting a
 N-parent merge, find the set of paths that were touched by walking
 N+1 trees in parallel.  These set of paths can then be turned into
 N pair-wise diff-tree results to be processed through rename
 detections and such.  And N=2 case nicely degenerates to the usual
 2-way diff-tree, which is very nice.


* nd/log-show-linear-break (2014-03-25) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-28 at ea4a8db)
 + log: add --show-linear-break to help see non-linear history
 + object.h: centralize object flag allocation

 Attempts to show where a single-strand-of-pearls break in "git log"
 output.

 Will merge to 'master'.
