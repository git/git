What's cooking in git.git (Jun 2014, #01; Tue, 3)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.

The first batch of topics, all of which have been cooking for quite
a while on the 'next' branch, have been merged to 'master'.  I'll

 - merge another batch to 'master', then
 - rewind the tip of 'next' in preparation to start accepting new topics

sometime mid-next week.  I'll also update tinyurl.com/gitCal for this
cycle soonish.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* as/grep-fullname-config (2014-03-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-28 at 810a076)
 + grep: add grep.fullName config variable

 Add a configuration variable to force --full-name to be default for
 "git grep".

 This may cause regressions on scripted users that do not expect
 this new behaviour.

* ew/config-protect-mode (2014-05-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-05-07 at 8443093)
 + config: preserve config file permissions on edits


* fc/merge-default-to-upstream (2014-04-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-04-22 at 4f98483)
 + merge: enable defaulttoupstream by default

 "git merge" without argument, even when there is an upstream
 defined for the current branch, refused to run until
 merge.defaultToUpstream is set to true. Flip the default of that
 configuration variable to true.


* fc/mergetool-prompt (2014-04-24) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-05-02 at a554691)
 + mergetool: document the default for --[no-]prompt
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-04-22 at dcaec94)
 + mergetool: run prompt only if guessed tool

 mergetool.prompt used to default to 'true', always causing a confirmation
 "do you really want to run the tool on this path" to be shown.

 Among the two purposes the prompt serves, ignore the use case to
 confirm that the user wants to view particular path with the named
 tool, and make the prompt only to confirm the choice of the tool
 made by autodetection and defaulting.  For those who configured the
 tool explicitly, the prompt shown for the latter purpose is simply
 annoying.

 Strictly speaking, this is a backward incompatible change and the
 users need to explicitly set the variable to 'true' if they want to
 resurrect the now-ignored use case.


* fc/mergetools-vimdiff3 (2014-04-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-04-22 at d843e75)
 + mergetools: add vimdiff3 mode


* fc/rerere-conflict-style (2014-04-30) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-05-07 at bde7fd0)
 + rerere: fix for merge.conflictstyle

 "git rerere forget" did not work well when merge.conflictstyle
 was set to a non-default value.


* jc/apply-ignore-whitespace (2014-03-26) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-04-04 at 53779a7)
 + apply --ignore-space-change: lines with and without leading whitespaces do not match

 "--ignore-space-change" option of "git apply" ignored the
 spaces at the beginning of line too aggressively, which is
 inconsistent with the option of the same name "diff" and "git diff"
 have.


* jk/commit-date-approxidate (2014-05-02) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-05-07 at 7ec8f7d)
 + commit: accept more date formats for "--date"
 + commit: print "Date" line when the user has set date
 + pretty: make show_ident_date public
 + commit: use split_ident_line to compare author/committer

 "git commit --date=<date>" option learned to read from more
 timestamp formats, including "--date=now".


* jk/external-diff-use-argv-array (2014-04-21) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-04-22 at e6d92d7)
 + run_external_diff: refactor cmdline setup logic
 + run_external_diff: hoist common bits out of conditional
 + run_external_diff: drop fflush(NULL)
 + run_external_diff: clean up error handling
 + run_external_diff: use an argv_array for the environment

 Code clean-up (and a bugfix which has been merged for 2.0).


* jx/blame-align-relative-time (2014-04-23) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-04-23 at 858df39)
 + blame: dynamic blame_date_width for different locales
 + blame: fix broken time_buf paddings in relative timestamp

 "git blame" miscounted number of columns needed to show localized
 timestamps, resulting in jaggy left-side-edge of the source code
 lines in its output.


* ks/tree-diff-nway (2014-04-09) 20 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-04-09 at c17228e)
 + mingw: activate alloca
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-04-08 at 6b74773)
 + combine-diff: speed it up, by using multiparent diff tree-walker directly
 + tree-diff: rework diff_tree() to generate diffs for multiparent cases as well
 + Portable alloca for Git
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-31 at 16a7bd4)
 + tree-diff: reuse base str(buf) memory on sub-tree recursion
 + tree-diff: no need to call "full" diff_tree_sha1 from show_path()
 + tree-diff: rework diff_tree interface to be sha1 based
 + tree-diff: diff_tree() should now be static
 + tree-diff: remove special-case diff-emitting code for empty-tree cases
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-25 at cfcbdac)
 + tree-diff: simplify tree_entry_pathcmp
 + tree-diff: show_path prototype is not needed anymore
 + tree-diff: rename compare_tree_entry -> tree_entry_pathcmp
 + tree-diff: move all action-taking code out of compare_tree_entry()
 + tree-diff: don't assume compare_tree_entry() returns -1,0,1
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-21 at d872679)
 + tree-diff: consolidate code for emitting diffs and recursion in one place
 + tree-diff: show_tree() is not needed
 + tree-diff: no need to pass match to skip_uninteresting()
 + tree-diff: no need to manually verify that there is no mode change for a path
 + combine-diff: move changed-paths scanning logic into its own function
 + combine-diff: move show_log_first logic/action out of paths scanning

 Instead of running N pair-wise diff-trees when inspecting a
 N-parent merge, find the set of paths that were touched by walking
 N+1 trees in parallel.  These set of paths can then be turned into
 N pair-wise diff-tree results to be processed through rename
 detections and such.  And N=2 case nicely degenerates to the usual
 2-way diff-tree, which is very nice.


* lr/git-run-setup-gently (2014-04-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-04-22 at 5c2523f)
 + git.c: treat RUN_SETUP_GENTLY and RUN_SETUP as mutually exclusive


* mh/ref-transaction (2014-04-07) 27 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-04-16 at a99f84d)

 + struct ref_update: add a type field
 + struct ref_update: add a lock field
 + ref_transaction_commit(): simplify code using temporary variables
 + struct ref_update: store refname as a FLEX_ARRAY

 + t1400: test one mistake at a time
 + update-ref --stdin -z: deprecate interpreting the empty string as zeros
 + update-ref.c: extract a new function, parse_next_sha1()
 + t1400: test that stdin -z update treats empty <newvalue> as zeros
 + update-ref --stdin: simplify error messages for missing oldvalues
 + update-ref --stdin: make error messages more consistent
 + update-ref --stdin: improve error messages for invalid values
 + update-ref.c: extract a new function, parse_refname()

 + refs.h: rename the action_on_err constants
 + t1400: add some more tests involving quoted arguments
 + parse_arg(): really test that argument is properly terminated
 + t1400: provide more usual input to the command
 + t1400: fix name and expected result of one test

 Update "update-ref --stdin [-z]" and then introduce a transactional
 support for (multi-)reference updates.


* mm/mediawiki-encoding-fix (2014-04-23) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-05-02 at 7744361)
 + git-remote-mediawiki: fix encoding issue for UTF-8 media files
 + git-remote-mediawiki: allow stop/start-ing the test server

 Enable threaded index-pack on platforms without thread-safe
 pread() emulation.


* rs/ref-update-check-errors-early (2014-04-17) 2 commits

 + sequencer.c: check for lock failure and bail early in fast_forward_to


* sk/msvc-dynlink-crt (2014-05-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-05-07 at 20f4839)
 + MSVC: link dynamically to the CRT


* sk/svn-parse-datestamp (2014-04-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-04-21 at 5ff519f)
 + SVN.pm::parse_svn_date: allow timestamps with a single-digit hour

 "git svn" learned to cope with malformed timestamps with only one
 digit in the hour part, e.g. 2014-01-07T5:01:02.048176Z, emitted
 by some broken subversion server implementations.


* sk/tag-contains-wo-recursion (2014-04-25) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-04-25 at f320750)
 + git tag --contains: avoid stack overflow


* ym/fix-opportunistic-index-update-race (2014-04-10) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-04-16 at cb92f4f)
 + read-cache.c: verify index file before we opportunistically update it
 + wrapper.c: add xpread() similar to xread()

 Read-only operations such as "git status" that internally refreshes
 the index write out the refreshed index to the disk to optimize
 future accesses to the working tree, but this could race with a
 "read-write" operation that modify the index while it is running.
 Detect such a race and avoid overwriting the index.

 Duy raised a good point that we may need to do the same for the
 normal writeout codepath, not just the "opportunistic" update
 codepath.  While that is true, nobody sane would be running two
 simultaneous operations that are clearly write-oriented competing
 with each other against the same index file.  So in that sense that
 can be done as a less urgent follow-up for this topic.

* bg/rebase-off-of-previous-branch (2014-04-16) 1 commit
 - git-rebase: print name of rev when using shorthand

 Teach "git rebase -" to report the concrete name of the branch
 (i.e. the previous one).

 But it stops short and does not do the same for "git rebase @{-1}".
 Expecting a reroll.


* tr/merge-recursive-index-only (2014-02-05) 3 commits
 - merge-recursive: -Xindex-only to leave worktree unchanged

 . revision: fold all merge diff variants into an enum merge_diff_mode
 . combine-diff: do not pass revs->dense_combined_merges redundantly
 (this branch uses tr/merge-recursive-index-only.)

 "log -p" output learns a new way to let users inspect a merge
 commit by showing the differences between the automerged result
 with conflicts the person who recorded the merge would have seen
 and the final conflict resolution that was recorded in the merge.

 Needs to be rebased, now kb/fast-hashmap topic is in.

 - Make 'git help everyday' work

 This may make the said command to emit something, but the source is
 not meant to be formatted into a manual pages to begin with, and
 also its contents are a bit stale.  It may be a good first step in
 the right direction, but needs more work to at least get the
 mark-up right before public consumption.

 Will hold.


* jk/branch-at-publish-rebased (2014-01-17) 5 commits
 . t1507 (rev-parse-upstream): fix typo in test title
 . implement @{publish} shorthand
 . branch_get: provide per-branch pushremote pointers
 . branch_get: return early on error
 . sha1_name: refactor upstream_mark

 Give an easier access to the tracking branches from "other" side in
 a triangular workflow by introducing B@{publish} that works in a
 similar way to how B@{upstream} does.

 Meant to be used as a basis for whatever Ram wants to build on.

 Ejected from 'pu' to unclutter.


* fc/publish-vs-upstream (2014-04-21) 8 commits
 . sha1_name: add support for @{publish} marks
 . sha1_name: simplify track finding
 . sha1_name: cleanup interpret_branch_name()
 . branch: display publish branch
 . push: add --set-publish option
 . branch: add --set-publish-to option
 . Add concept of 'publish' branch
 . t5516 (fetch-push): fix test restoration

 Add branch@{publish}; it seems that this is somewhat different from
 Ram and Peff started working on.  At least the tip needs to be
 rerolled not to squat on @{p} which @{push} and possibly @{pull}
 may want to share.

 Ejected from 'pu' to unclutter.


* rb/merge-prepare-commit-msg-hook (2014-01-10) 4 commits
 - merge: drop unused arg from abort_commit method signature
 - merge: make prepare_to_commit responsible for write_merge_state
 - t7505: ensure cleanup after hook blocks merge
 - t7505: add missing &&

 Expose more merge states (e.g. $GIT_DIR/MERGE_MODE) to hooks that
 run during "git merge".  The log message stresses too much on one
 hook, prepare-commit-msg, but it would equally apply to other hooks
 like post-merge, I think.

 Waiting for a reroll.

 Nico and Duy advancing the eternal vaporware pack-v4.  This is here
 primarily for wider distribution of the preview edition.

 Needs to be rebased, now the pack-bitmap series is in.


* tg/perf-lib-test-perf-cleanup (2013-09-19) 2 commits
 - perf-lib: add test_perf_cleanup target

 Will hold.

 - show-branch.c: lift all_mask/all_revs to a global static

 - $GIT_COMMON_DIR: a new environment variable
 - commit: use SEQ_DIR instead of hardcoding "sequencer"
 - fast-import: use git_path() for accessing .git dir instead of get_git_dir()
 - reflog: avoid constructing .lock path with git_path
 - *.sh: respect $GIT_INDEX_FILE
 - git_path(): be aware of file relocation in $GIT_DIR
 - path.c: group git_path(), git_pathdup() and strbuf_git_path() together
 - path.c: rename vsnpath() to do_git_path()
 - git_snpath(): retire and replace with strbuf_git_path()
 - path.c: make get_pathname() call sites return const char *
 - path.c: make get_pathname() return strbuf instead of static buffer

 A replacement for contrib/workdir/git-new-workdir that does not
 rely on symbolic links and make sharing of objects and refs safer
 by making the borrowee and borrowers aware of each other.

 Will hold.

* jc/format-patch (2013-04-22) 2 commits
 . format-patch: --inline-single
 . format-patch: rename "no_inline" field

 A new option to send a single patch to the standard output to be
 appended at the bottom of a message.  I personally have no need for
 this, but it was easy enough to cobble together.  Tests, docs and
 stripping out more MIMEy stuff are left as exercises to interested
 parties.


* mt/rebase-i-ack (2014-05-19) 6 commits
 . git-ack: record an ack
 . rebase: test ack
 . git-rebase: document ack
 . rebase -i: add ack action
 + test: add test_write_lines helper
 + patch-id: make it stable against hunk reordering
 (this branch is tangled with mt/patch-id-stable.)

 Will be rerolled post 2.0

 (this branch uses mh/ref-transaction; is tangled with rs/ref-transaction-2.)

 Temporarily dropped; there are a lot of conflicts with topics in
 flight, and the topic is still being worked on with frequent
 rerolls.  Will pick up a reroll once things settle down a bit after
 the release.
