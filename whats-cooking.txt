What's cooking in git.git (Aug 2020, #01; Mon, 3)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'seen' (formerly 'pu'---proposed updates) while commits prefixed
with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

Some topics that have been cooking in 'next' during the previous
cycle, in addition to some fixes to 2.28, have been merged to
'master', and the tip of 'next' has been rewound.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches of the
repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

 "git receive-pack" that accepts requests by "git push" learned to
 outsource most of the ref updates to the new "proc-receive" hook.

* mf/submodule-summary-with-correct-repository (2020-06-24) 2 commits
 - submodule: use submodule repository when preparing summary
 - revision: use repository from rev_info when parsing commits

 "git diff/show" on a change that involves a submodule used to read
 the information on commits in the submodule from a wrong repository
 and gave a wrong information when the commit-graph is involved.

 Needs tests.


* dr/push-remoteref-fix (2020-04-23) 1 commit
 - remote.c: fix handling of %(push:remoteref)

 The "%(push:remoteref)" placeholder in the "--format=" argument of
 "git format-patch" (and friends) only showed what got explicitly
 configured, not what ref at the receiving end would be updated when
 "git push" was used, as it ignored the default behaviour (e.g. update
 the same ref as the source).

 Expecting a reroll.

  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-03 at 39fefa6b82)

 + doc/git-log: move "-t" into diff-options list
 + doc/git-log: drop "-r" diff option
 + doc/git-log: move "Diff Formatting" from rev-list-options

 + revision: add "--no-diff-merges" option to counteract "-m"
 + log: drop "--cc implies -m" logic

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2020-08-01

 "git log --first-parent -p" showed patches only for single-parent
 commits on the first-parent chain; the "--first-parent" option has
 been made to imply "-m".  Use "--no-diff-merges" to restore the
 previous behaviour to omit patches for merge commits.

 Waiting for the discussion to settle.
 cf. <87lfivqvgf.fsf@osv.gnss.ru>
 If Sergey wants to send in --diff-merges=(none|<num>|c|cc|all)
 enhancement reasonably soon, I do not mind holding this off for a
 bit longer out of 'master'.


* jk/strvec (2020-07-30) 11 commits
 - strvec: rename struct fields
 - strvec: drop argv_array compatibility layer
 - strvec: update documention to avoid argv_array
 - strvec: fix indentation in renamed calls
 - strvec: convert remaining callers away from argv_array name
 - strvec: convert more callers away from argv_array name
 - strvec: convert builtin/ callers away from argv_array name
 - quote: rename sq_dequote_to_argv_array to mention strvec
 - strvec: rename files from argv-array to strvec
 - argv-array: rename to strvec
 - argv-array: use size_t for count and alloc
 (this branch is used by ds/maintenance.)

 The argv_array API is useful for not just managing argv but any
 "vector" (NULL-terminated array) of strings, and has seen adoption
 to a certain degree.  It has been renamed to "strvec" to reduce the
 barrier to adoption.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* pd/mergetool-nvimdiff (2020-07-29) 2 commits
 - mergetools: add support for nvimdiff (neovim) family
 - mergetool--lib: improve support for vimdiff-style tool variants

 The existing backends for "git mergetool" based on variants of vim
 have been refactored and then support for "nvim" has been added.


* al/bisect-first-parent (2020-07-29) 3 commits
 - bisect: combine args passed to find_bisection()
 - bisect: introduce first-parent flag
 - rev-list: allow bisect and first-parent flags

 "git bisect" learns the "--first-parent" option to find the first
 breakage along the first-parent chain.


* dd/send-email-config (2020-07-23) 1 commit
 - git-send-email: die if sendmail.* config is set

 Stop when "sendmail.*" configuration variables are defined, which
 could be a mistaken attempt to define "sendemail.*" variables.


* jt/pack-objects-prefetch-in-batch (2020-07-21) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-03 at 29424e614d)
 + pack-objects: prefetch objects to be packed
 + pack-objects: refactor to oid_object_info_extended

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2020-08-01

 While packing many objects in a repository with a promissor remote,
 lazily fetching missing objects from the promissor remote one by
 one may be inefficient---the code now attempts to fetch all the
 missing objects in batch (obviously this won't work for a lazy
 clone that lazily fetches tree objects as you cannot even enumerate
 what blobs are missing until you learn which trees are missing).

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jt/pretend-object-never-come-from-elsewhere (2020-07-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-03 at 36cd23aae5)
 + sha1-file: make pretend_object_file() not prefetch

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2020-08-01

 The pretend-object mechanism checks if the given object already
 exists in the object store before deciding to keep the data
 in-core, but the check would have triggered lazy fetching of such
 an object from a promissor remote.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* bc/sha-256-part-3 (2020-07-30) 39 commits

  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-03 at c90fea8e5e)
 + completion: add show --color-moved[-ws]

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2020-08-01

 Command line completion (in contrib/) update.

 Will merge to 'master'.
 A follow-up patch to reduce duplication may be warranted.

 - Make HEAD a PSEUDOREF rather than PER_WORKTREE.
 - Modify pseudo refs through ref backend storage

 (this branch uses jk/strvec.)

 A "git gc"'s big brother has been introduced to take care of more
 repository maintenance tasks, not limited to the object database
 cleaning.


* ls/mergetool-meld-auto-merge (2020-07-12) 2 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - Support auto-merge for meld to follow the vim-diff behavior

 The 'meld' backend of the "git mergetool" learned to give the
 underlying 'meld' the '--auto-merge' option, which would help
 reduce the amount of text that requires manual merging.

 Expecting a reroll.


* tb/upload-pack-filters (2020-08-03) 3 commits
 - upload-pack.c: introduce 'uploadpackfilter.tree.maxDepth'
 - upload-pack.c: allow banning certain object filter(s)
 - list_objects_filter_options: introduce 'list_object_filter_config_name'

 The component to respond to "git fetch" request is made more
 configurable to selectively allow or reject object filtering
 specification used for partial cloning.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* mt/hash-to-hex-thread-safety (2020-06-26) 2 commits
 - hex: make hash_to_hex_algop() and friends thread-safe
 - compat/win32/pthread: add pthread_once()

 hash_to_hex() used a set of rotating static buffers, which was not
 safe to use in a threaded environment.  This has been made safer by
 using thread-local storage.

 Expecting a reroll.

 - sequencer: rename amend_author to author_to_free

 - config: add setting to ignore sparsity patterns in some cmds
 - grep: honor sparse checkout patterns
 - config: correctly read worktree configs in submodules

 "git grep" has been tweaked to be limited to the sparse checkout
 paths.

 Review needed on 4/6; otherwise looking sane.

 Now it is part of ds/maintenance topic.
