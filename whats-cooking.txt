What's cooking in git.git (Nov 2020, #06; Mon, 30)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'seen' (formerly 'pu'---proposed updates) while commits prefixed
with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into.  Some repositories have
only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

Release tarballs are available at:

 + fsck_tree(): wrap some long lines
 + fsck_tree(): fix shadowed variable

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2020-10-23

 "git fsck" and the corresponding check done during the transport
 learned to ensure that in-tree files like `.gitignore` and
 `.gitattributes` are not symbolic links.

 It seems that there are real projects with .gitignore recorded as
 symlinks, which may need to loosen the fsck setting.  Do we need to
 introduce a class that is separate from symlinked .gitmodules that
 probably is with potential consequences that is more/less grave?

* dr/push-remoteref-fix (2020-04-23) 1 commit
 - remote.c: fix handling of %(push:remoteref)

 The "%(push:remoteref)" placeholder in the "--format=" argument of
 "git format-patch" (and friends) only showed what got explicitly
 configured, not what ref at the receiving end would be updated when
 "git push" was used, as it ignored the default behaviour (e.g. update
 the same ref as the source).

 Discard for now.

* ds/config-literal-value (2020-11-25) 8 commits
 - config doc: value-pattern is not necessarily a regexp
 - config: implement --fixed-value with --get*
 - config: plumb --fixed-value into config API
 - config: add --fixed-value option, un-implemented
 - t1300: add test for --replace-all with value-pattern
 - t1300: test "set all" mode with value-pattern
 - config: replace 'value_regex' with 'value_pattern'
 - config: convert multi_replace to flags
 (this branch is used by ds/maintenance-part-3.)

 Various subcommands of "git config" that takes value_regex
 learn the "--literal-value" option to take the value_regex option
 as a literal string.

 Expecting a (hopefully final) reroll.


* ds/maintenance-part-3 (2020-11-25) 2 commits
 - maintenance: use 'git config --fixed-value'
 - Merge branch 'ds/config-literal-value' into ds/maintenance-part-3
 (this branch uses ds/config-literal-value.)

 "git maintenance" command had trouble working in a directory whose
 pathname contained an ERE metacharacter like '+'.

 Blocked by ds/config-literal-value.


* ag/merge-strategies-in-c (2020-11-24) 13 commits
 - sequencer: use the "octopus" merge strategy without forking
 - sequencer: use the "resolve" strategy without forking
 - merge: use the "octopus" strategy without forking
 - merge: use the "resolve" strategy without forking
 - merge-octopus: rewrite in C
 - merge-recursive: move better_branch_name() to merge.c
 - merge-resolve: rewrite in C
 - merge-index: don't fork if the requested program is `git-merge-one-file'
 - merge-index: libify merge_one_path() and merge_all()
 - merge-one-file: rewrite in C
 - update-index: move add_cacheinfo() to read-cache.c
 - t6060: modify multiple files to expose a possible issue with merge-index
 - t6407: modernise tests

 The resolve and octopus merge strategy backends have been rewritten
 in C.

 Needs review.


* ps/update-ref-multi-transaction (2020-11-16) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-11-30 at c1c3e23374)
 + update-ref: disallow "start" for ongoing transactions
 + p1400: use `git-update-ref --stdin` to test multiple transactions
 + update-ref: allow creation of multiple transactions
 + t1400: avoid touching refs on filesystem

 "git update-ref --stdin" learns to take multiple transactions in a
 single session.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* js/add-i-color-fix (2020-11-16) 11 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-11-30 at 5cb8202cd4)
 + add -i: verify in the tests that colors can be overridden
 + add -p: prefer color.diff.context over color.diff.plain
 + add -i (Perl version): color header to match the C version
 + add -i (built-in): use the same indentation as the Perl version
 + add -p (built-in): do not color the progress indicator separately
 + add -i (built-in): use correct names to load color.diff.* config
 + add -i (built-in): prevent the `reset` "color" from being configured
 + add -i: use `reset_color` consistently
 + add -p (built-in): imitate `xdl_format_hunk_hdr()` generating hunk headers
 + add -i (built-in): send error messages to stderr
 + add -i (built-in): do show an error message for incorrect inputs

 "git add -i" failed to honor custom colors configured to show
 patches, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.

* js/trace2-session-id (2020-11-11) 11 commits
 - receive-pack: log received client session ID
 - send-pack: advertise session ID in capabilities
 - upload-pack, serve: log received client session ID
 - fetch-pack: advertise session ID in capabilities
 - transport: log received server session ID
 - serve: advertise session ID in v2 capabilities
 - receive-pack: advertise session ID in v0 capabilities
 - upload-pack: advertise session ID in v0 capabilities
 - trace2: add a public function for getting the SID
 - docs: new transfer.advertiseSID option
 - docs: new capability to advertise session IDs

 The transport layer was taught to optionally exchange the session
 ID assigned by the trace2 subsystem during fetch/push transactions.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ds/maintenance-part-4 (2020-11-24) 4 commits
 - maintenance: use Windows scheduled tasks
 - maintenance: use launchctl on macOS
 - maintenance: include 'cron' details in docs
 - maintenance: extract platform-specific scheduling

 Follow-up on the "maintenance part-3" which introduced scheduled
 maintenance tasks to support platforms whose native scheduling
 methods are not 'cron'.


* sj/untracked-files-in-submodule-directory-is-not-dirty (2020-10-26) 1 commit
 - diff: do not show submodule with untracked files as "-dirty"

 "git diff" showed a submodule working tree with untracked cruft as
 "Submodule commit <objectname>-dirty", but a natural expectation is
 that the "-dirty" indicator would align with "git describe --dirty",
 which does not consider having untracked files in the working tree
 as source of dirtiness.  The inconsistency has been fixed.

 Needs doc update and also adjusting "git status".


* ak/corrected-commit-date (2020-10-08) 10 commits
 - doc: add corrected commit date info
 - commit-reach: use corrected commit dates in paint_down_to_common()
 - commit-graph: use generation v2 only if entire chain does
 - commit-graph: implement generation data chunk
 - commit-graph: implement corrected commit date
 - commit-graph: add a slab to store topological levels
 - commit-graph: return 64-bit generation number
 - commit-graph: consolidate fill_commit_graph_info
 - revision: parse parent in indegree_walk_step()
 - commit-graph: fix regression when computing Bloom filters

 The commit-graph learned to use corrected commit dates instead of
 the generation number to help topological revision traversal.

 Getting there.
