What's cooking in git.git (Oct 2018, #03; Wed, 17)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

Note that "cf. <msg-id>" are not meant as "clear all of these and
you are home free".  They are primarily to prevent me from merging
topics that are not ready to 'next' by mistake and remind me where
to go back to read the last state of the discussion in the archive.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

[Graduated to "master"]

* ab/commit-graph-progress (2018-09-20) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-09-24 at 76f2f5c1e3)
 + gc: fix regression in 7b0f229222 impacting --quiet
 + commit-graph verify: add progress output
 + commit-graph write: add progress output
 (this branch is used by ds/commit-graph-leakfix.)

 (Originally merged to 'next' on 2018-09-20 at 24ca94b1d4)

 Generation of (experimental) commit-graph files have so far been
 fairly silent, even though it takes noticeable amount of time in a
 meaningfully large repository.  The users will now see progress
 output.


* ds/commit-graph-with-grafts (2018-08-21) 8 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-09 at 851a457102)
 + commit-graph: close_commit_graph before shallow walk
 + commit-graph: not compatible with uninitialized repo
 + commit-graph: not compatible with grafts
 + commit-graph: not compatible with replace objects
 + test-repository: properly init repo
 + commit-graph: update design document
 + refs.c: upgrade for_each_replace_ref to be a each_repo_ref_fn callback
 + refs.c: migrate internal ref iteration to pass thru repository argument

 The recently introduced commit-graph auxiliary data is incompatible
 with mechanisms such as replace & grafts that "breaks" immutable
 nature of the object reference relationship.  Disable optimizations
 based on its use (and updating existing commit-graph) when these
 incompatible features are in use in the repository.


* ds/reachable-final-cleanup (2018-09-25) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-12 at 32c6d5f55a)
 + commit-reach: cleanups in can_all_from_reach...

 Code already in 'master' is further cleaned-up by this patch.


* dz/credential-doc-url-matching-rules (2018-09-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-12 at 4547952530)
 + doc: clarify gitcredentials path component matching

 Doc update.


* en/merge-cleanup (2018-09-20) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-09 at f3a00b506f)
 + merge-recursive: rename merge_file_1() and merge_content()
 + merge-recursive: remove final remaining caller of merge_file_one()
 + merge-recursive: avoid wrapper function when unnecessary and wasteful
 + merge-recursive: set paths correctly when three-way merging content
 (this branch is used by en/merge-cleanup-more.)

 Code clean-up.


* en/status-multiple-renames-to-the-same-target-fix (2018-09-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-12 at 4976fc61a0)
 + commit: fix erroneous BUG, 'multiple renames on the same target? how?'

 The code in "git status" sometimes hit an assertion failure.  This
 was caused by a structure that was reused without cleaning the data
 used for the first run, which has been corrected.


* fe/doc-updates (2018-09-21) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-10 at 2eea3a88bc)
 + git-describe.1: clarify that "human readable" is also git-readable
 + git-column.1: clarify initial description, provide examples
 + git-archimport.1: specify what kind of Arch we're talking about

 Doc updates.


* jk/check-everything-connected-is-long-gone (2018-09-25) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-12 at 4ce30c9a30)
 + receive-pack: update comment with check_everything_connected

 Comment fix.


* jk/delta-islands-with-bitmap-reuse-delta-fix (2018-09-19) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-09 at 10e58be2af)
 + pack-objects: handle island check for "external" delta base

 Fix interactions between two recent topics.


* jk/oideq-hasheq-cleanup (2018-10-04) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-12 at 7c9b5681da)
 + more oideq/hasheq conversions

 Code clean-up.


* jn/gc-auto (2018-07-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-10 at 9f0f1f770e)
 + gc: do not return error for prior errors in daemonized mode
 (this branch uses jn/gc-auto-prep.)

 "gc --auto" ended up calling exit(-1) upon error, which has been
 corrected to use exit(1).  Also the error reporting behaviour when
 daemonized has been updated to exit with zero status when stopping
 due to a previously discovered error (which implies there is no
 point running gc to improve the situation); we used to exit with
 failure in such a case.


* jn/gc-auto-prep (2018-07-17) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-10 at 4ab6a62f62)
 + gc: exit with status 128 on failure
 + gc: improve handling of errors reading gc.log
 (this branch is used by jn/gc-auto.)

 Code clean-up.

  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-10 at fa2b394bd5)
 + mailmap: consistently normalize brian m. carlson's name

 + mingw: set _WIN32_WINNT explicitly for Git for Windows
 + compat/poll: prepare for targeting Windows Vista

 The minimum version of Windows supported by Windows port fo Git is
 now set to Vista.


* ma/commit-graph-docs (2018-09-27) 4 commits

 + tests: don't swallow Git errors upstream of pipes
 + t/*: fix ordering of expected/observed arguments
 + tests: standardize pipe placement
 + Documentation: add shell guidelines

  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-10 at 5ada84ed7a)
 + t5551: compare sorted cookies files
 + t5551: move setup code inside test_expect blocks

 Test update.
 Supersedes tz/t5551-with-curl-7.61.1 topic


* tq/refs-internal-comment-fix (2018-09-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-09 at 422313bbd0)
 + refs: docstring typo

 + t0014: introduce an alias testing suite
 + alias: show the call history when an alias is looping
 + alias: add support for aliases of an alias

 An alias that expands to another alias has so far been forbidden,
 but now it is allowed to create such an alias.

 The documentation of "git gc" has been updated to mention that it
 is no longer limited to "pruning away crufts" but also updates
 ancillary files like commit-graph as a part of repository
 optimization.

 Doc update.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ot/ref-filter-plug-leaks (2018-10-11) 3 commits
 . ref-filter: free item->value and item->value->s
 . ls-remote: release memory instead of UNLEAK
 . ref-filter: free memory from used_atom

 Plugging a handful of memory leaks in the ref-filter codepath.

 Seems to break t6300 standalone and when merged to 'pu'.


* rv/send-email-cc-misc-by (2018-10-16) 3 commits
 - send-email: also pick up cc addresses from -by trailers
 - send-email: only consider lines containing @ or <> for automatic Cc'ing
 - Documentation/git-send-email.txt: style fixes

 "git send-email" learned to grab address-looking string on any
 trailer whose name ends with "-by"; --suppress-cc=misc-by on the
 command line, or setting sendemail.suppresscc configuration
 variable to "misc-by", can be used to disable this behaviour.

 This is a backward-incompatible change that may surprise existing
 users.

 Will merge to 'next'.

* lm/range-diff-submodule-fix (2018-10-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-16 at 3e50d7a73b)
 + range-diff: allow to diff files regardless submodule

 "git range-diff" did not work well when the compared ranges had
 changes in submodules and the "--submodule=log" was used.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* sb/diff-emit-line-ws-markup-cleanup (2018-10-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-16 at a68a6f0003)

 Code clean-up.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2018-10-15) 1 commit
 - zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".


* jc/how-to-document-api (2018-09-29) 1 commit

 Doc update.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/rebase-in-c-5-test-typofix (2018-10-11) 1 commit
 - rebase: fix typoes in error messages
 (this branch uses pk/rebase-in-c, pk/rebase-in-c-2-basic, pk/rebase-in-c-3-acts, pk/rebase-in-c-4-opts and pk/rebase-in-c-5-test; is tangled with js/rebase-in-c-5.5-work-with-rebase-i-in-c and pk/rebase-in-c-6-final.)

 Typofix.

 Will merge to 'next' together with pk/rebase-i-in-c-6-final.


* jc/war-on-string-list (2018-09-28) 1 commit
 - fetch: replace string-list used as a look-up table with a hashmap

 Replace two string-list instances used as look-up tables in "git
 fetch" with a pair of hashmaps.  WIP as there is another such use
 of string-list nearby that should be converted at the same time.


* js/rebase-i-break (2018-10-12) 2 commits
 - rebase -i: introduce the 'break' command
 - rebase -i: clarify what happens on a failed `exec`
 (this branch uses ag/rebase-i-in-c; is tangled with ag/sequencer-reduce-rewriting-todo, js/rebase-in-c-5.5-work-with-rebase-i-in-c and pk/rebase-in-c-6-final.)

 "git rebase -i" learned a new insn, 'break', that the user can
 insert in the to-do list.  Upon hitting it, the command returns
 control back to the user.

 Will merge to 'next' after 'pk/rebase-in-c-6-final'.


* js/remote-archive-v2 (2018-09-28) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-12 at 5f34377f60)
 + archive: allow archive over HTTP(S) with proto v2
 + archive: implement protocol v2 archive command
 + archive: use packet_reader for communications
 + archive: follow test standards around assertions

 The original implementation of "git archive --remote" more or less
 bypassed the transport layer and did not work over http(s).  The
 version 2 of the protocol is defined to allow going over http(s) as
 well as Git native transport.

 Will hold.
 cf. <20181016212008.GA249669@google.com>

* jt/non-blob-lazy-fetch (2018-10-04) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-12 at 7466c6bd7d)
 + fetch-pack: exclude blobs when lazy-fetching trees
 + fetch-pack: avoid object flags if no_dependents

 A partial clone that is configured to lazily fetch missing objects
 will on-demand issue a "git fetch" request to the originating
 repository to fill not-yet-obtained objects.  The request has been
 optimized for requesting a tree object (and not the leaf blob
 objects contained in it) by telling the originating repository that
 no blobs are needed.

 Will merge to 'master'.

* nd/help-commands-verbose-by-default (2018-10-03) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-12 at 32de8f53e0)
 + help -a: improve and make --verbose default

 "git help -a" and "git help -av" give different pieces of
 information, and generally the "verbose" version is more friendly
 to the new users.  "git help -a" by default now uses the more
 verbose output (with "--no-verbose", you can go back to the
 original).  Also "git help -av" now lists aliases and external
 commands, which it did not used to.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* pw/diff-color-moved-ws-fix (2018-10-04) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-12 at 73badc83fe)
 + diff --color-moved: fix a memory leak
 + diff --color-moved-ws: fix another memory leak
 + diff --color-moved-ws: fix a memory leak

 + diff --color-moved-ws: fix double free crash

 Various fixes to "diff --color-moved-ws".

 Will merge to 'master'.


* rs/grep-no-recursive (2018-10-03) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-12 at 1499dc98ba)
 + grep: add -r/--[no-]recursive

 Unlike "grep", "git grep" by default recurses to the whole tree.
 The command learned "git grep --recursive" option, so that "git
 grep --no-recursive" can serve as a synonym to setting the
 max-depth to 0.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* rs/oidset-on-khash (2018-10-04) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-12 at 8bb0152b3f)
 + oidset: uninline oidset_init()
 + oidset: use khash
 + khash: factor out kh_release_*
 + fetch-pack: load tip_oids eagerly iff needed
 + fetch-pack: factor out is_unmatched_ref()

 The oidset API was built on top of the oidmap API which in turn is
 on the hashmap API.  Replace the implementation to build on top of
 the khash API and gain performance.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* rv/alias-help (2018-10-11) 3 commits
 - git-help.txt: document "git help cmd" vs "git cmd --help" for aliases
 - git.c: handle_alias: prepend alias info when first argument is -h
 - help: redirect to aliased commands for "git cmd --help"

 "git cmd --help" when "cmd" is aliased used to only say "cmd is
 aliased to ...".  Now it shows that to the standard error stream
 and runs "git $cmd --help" where $cmd is the first word of the
 alias expansion.  This could be misleading for those who alias a
 command with options (e.g. with "[alias] cpn = cherry-pick -n",
 "git cpn --help" would show the manual of "cherry-pick", and the
 reader would not be told to pay close attention to the part that
 describes the "--no-commit" option until closing the pager that
 showed the contents of the manual, if the pager is configured to
 restore the original screen, or would not be told at all, if the
 pager simply makes the message on the standard error scroll away.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sb/strbuf-h-update (2018-09-29) 1 commit
 - strbuf.h: format according to coding guidelines

 Code clean-up to serve as a BCP example.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 - Merge branch 'ag/rebase-i-in-c' into ag/sequencer-reduce-rewriting-todo
 (this branch uses ag/rebase-i-in-c; is tangled with js/rebase-i-break, js/rebase-in-c-5.5-work-with-rebase-i-in-c and pk/rebase-in-c-6-final.)

 The scripted version of "git rebase -i" wrote and rewrote the todo
 list many times during a single step of its operation, and the
 recent C-rewrite made a faithful conversion of the logic to C.  The
 implementation has been updated to carry necessary information
 around in-core to avoid rewriting the same file over and over
 unnecessarily.

 Will hold, waiting for the "rebase-in-c" and "rebase-i-in-c" topics.

 + transport: list refs before fetch if necessary

  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-12 at 152ad8e336)
 + cache-tree: skip some blob checks in partial clone

 In a partial clone that will lazily be hydrated from the
 originating repository, we generally want to avoid "does this
 object exist (locally)?" on objects that we deliberately omitted
 when we created the clone.  The cache-tree codepath (which is used
 to write a tree object out of the index) however insisted that the
 object exists, even for paths that are outside of the partial
 checkout area.  The code has been updated to avoid such a check.

 Will merge to 'master'.

* tb/filter-alternate-refs (2018-10-09) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-12 at 21c14722f1)
 + transport.c: introduce core.alternateRefsPrefixes
 + transport.c: introduce core.alternateRefsCommand
 + transport.c: extract 'fill_alternate_refs_command'
 + transport: drop refnames from for_each_alternate_ref

 When pushing into a repository that borrows its objects from an
 alternate object store, "git receive-pack" that responds to the
 push request on the other side lists the tips of refs in the
 alternate to reduce the amount of objects transferred.  This
 sometimes is detrimental when the number of refs in the alternate
 is absurdly large, in which case the bandwidth saved in potentially
 fewer objects transferred is wasted in excessively large ref
 advertisement.  The alternate refs that are advertised are now
 configurable with a pair of configuration variables.

 Will merge to 'master'.
