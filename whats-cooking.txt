What's cooking in git.git (Jan 2020, #04; Wed, 22)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

Git 2.25 is out.  The tip of 'next' has been rewound and a handful
of topics have been rebased to avoid the premature merge of
ra/rebase-i-more-options which has been reverted.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

 + graph: fix lack of color in horizontal lines
 + graph: drop assert() for merge with two collapsing parents
 (this branch is used by ds/graph-horizontal-edges.)

 Since recent updates to the log graph rendering code, drawing
 certain merges started triggering an assert on a condition that
 would no longer hold true, which has been corrected.

 - checkout: don't revert file on ambiguous tracking branches
 - parse_branchname_arg(): extract part as new function

 "git checkout X" did not correctly fail when X is not a local
 branch but could name more than one remote-tracking branches
 (i.e. to be dwimmed as the starting point to create a corresponding
 local branch), which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 + unpack-trees: watch for out-of-range index position

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2020-01-09

 The code that tries to skip over the entries for the paths in a
 single directory using the cache-tree was not careful enough
 against corrupt index file.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* hw/advice-add-nothing (2020-01-15) 1 commit

 + restore: invalidate cache-tree when removing entries with --staged

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2020-01-09

 "git restore --staged" did not correctly update the cache-tree
 structure, resulting in bogus trees to be written afterwards, which
 has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ds/graph-horizontal-edges (2020-01-15) 2 commits
 - graph: fix collapse of multiple edges
 - graph: add test to demonstrate horizontal line bug

 Rendering by "git log --graph" of ancestry lines leading to a merge

 recent update, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ds/sparse-cone (2020-01-10) 1 commit
 - unpack-trees: correctly compute result count

 The code recently added in this release to move to the entry beyond
 the ones in the same directory in the index in the sparse-cone mode
 did not count the number of entries to skip over incorrectly, which
 has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.

* es/fetch-show-failed-submodules-atend (2020-01-17) 1 commit
 - fetch: emphasize failure during submodule fetch

 A fetch that is told to recursively fetch updates in submodules
 inevitably produces reams of output, and it becomes hard to spot
 error messages.  The command has been taught to enumerate
 submodules that had errors at the end of the operation.

 option.

 was rewritten in C back in 2.20 era, which has been corrected.

 Was waiting for discussion to settle.

 "git config" can be told to affect the existing entries that
 "match" the given value via its value_regex argument.  It learned
 to normalize the value set in the configuration and the value given
 from the command line before computing they "match", e.g. "true" in
 the configuration file can now match with "yes" given from the
 command line.

 side choosing from one of them.

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2020-01-04

 has_object_file() said "no" given an object registered to the
 system via pretend_object_file(), making it inconsistent with

 - rebase: add an --am option
 - rebase: move incompatibility checks between backend options a bit earlier
 - git-rebase.txt: add more details about behavioral differences of backends
 - rebase: allow more types of rebases to fast-forward
 - t3432: make these tests work with either am or merge backends
 - rebase: fix handling of restrict_revision
 - rebase: make sure to pass along the quiet flag to the sequencer
 - rebase, sequencer: remove the broken GIT_QUIET handling
 - t3406: simplify an already simple test
 - rebase (interactive-backend): fix handling of commits that become empty
 - rebase (interactive-backend): make --keep-empty the default
 - t3404: directly test the behavior of interest
 - git-rebase.txt: update description of --allow-empty-message

 "git rebase" has learned to use the sequencer backend by default,
 while allowing "--am" option to go back to the traditional "am"
 backend.

* jn/test-lint-one-shot-export-to-shell-function (2020-01-15) 3 commits
 - fetch test: mark test of "skipping" haves as v0-only
 - t/check-non-portable-shell: detect "FOO= shell_func", too
 - fetch test: avoid use of "VAR= cmd" with a shell function
 (this branch is used by jn/promote-proto2-to-default.)

 The test-lint machinery knew to check "VAR=VAL shell_function"
 construct, but did not check "VAR= shell_funciton", which has been
 corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* js/add-p-leftover-bits (2020-01-15) 10 commits
 - ci: include the built-in `git add -i` in the `linux-gcc` job
 - built-in add -p: handle Escape sequences more efficiently
 - built-in add -p: handle Escape sequences in interactive.singlekey mode
 - built-in add -p: respect the `interactive.singlekey` config setting
 - terminal: add a new function to read a single keystroke
 - terminal: accommodate Git for Windows' default terminal
 - terminal: make the code of disable_echo() reusable
 - built-in add -p: handle diff.algorithm
 - built-in add -p: support interactive.diffFilter
 - t3701: adjust difffilter test
 (this branch uses js/patch-mode-in-others-in-c.)

 The final leg of rewriting "add -i/-p" in C.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* pw/advise-rebase-skip (2019-12-06) 9 commits
 - rebase -i: leave CHERRY_PICK_HEAD when there are conflicts
 - rebase: fix advice when a fixup creates an empty commit
 - commit: give correct advice for empty commit during a rebase
 - commit: encapsulate determine_whence() for sequencer
 - commit: use enum value for multiple cherry-picks
 - sequencer: write CHERRY_PICK_HEAD for reword and edit
 - cherry-pick: check commit error messages
 - cherry-pick: add test for `--skip` advice in `git commit`
 - t3404: use test_cmp_rev

 The mechanism to prevent "git commit" from making an empty commit
 or amending during an interrupted cherry-pick was broken during the
 rewrite of "git rebase" in C, which has been corrected.

 What's the status of this one?
 The tip two are still RFC.


* js/patch-mode-in-others-in-c (2019-12-21) 7 commits
 - commit --interactive: make it work with the built-in `add -i`
 - built-in add -p: implement the "worktree" patch modes
 - built-in add -p: implement the "checkout" patch modes
 - built-in stash: use the built-in `git add -p` if so configured
 - legacy stash -p: respect the add.interactive.usebuiltin setting
 - built-in add -p: implement the "stash" and "reset" patch modes
 - built-in add -p: prepare for patch modes other than "stage"
 (this branch is used by js/add-p-leftover-bits.)

 The effort to move "git-add--interactive" to C continues.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/packfile-reuse-cleanup (2019-10-23) 9 commits
 - pack-objects: improve partial packfile reuse
 - builtin/pack-objects: introduce obj_is_packed()
 - pack-objects: introduce pack.allowPackReuse
 - csum-file: introduce hashfile_total()
 - pack-bitmap: introduce bitmap_walk_contains()
 - pack-bitmap: don't rely on bitmap_git->reuse_objects
 - ewah/bitmap: introduce bitmap_word_alloc()
 - packfile: expose get_delta_base()
 - builtin/pack-objects: report reused packfile objects

 The way "git pack-objects" reuses objects stored in existing pack
 to generate its result has been improved.

 Needs further clarification?

* js/advise-rebase-skip (2019-10-23) 3 commits
 . commit: give correct advice for empty commit during a rebase
 . sequencer: export the function to get the path of `.git/rebase-merge/`
 . cherry-pick: add test for `--skip` advice in `git commit`

 The logic used in "git commit" to give hints and errors depending
 on what operation was in progress learned to distinguish rebase and
 cherry-pick better.
