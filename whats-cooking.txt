What's cooking in git.git (Oct 2009, #03; Mon, 19)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones
marked with '.' do not appear in any of the integration branches, but I am
still holding onto them.

In 1.7.0, we plan to correct handful of warts in the interfaces everybody
agrees that they were mistakes.  The resulting system may not be strictly
backward compatible.  Currently planeed changes are:

 * refuse push to update the checked out branch in a non-bare repo by
   default

   Make "git push" into a repository to update the branch that is checked
   out fail by default.  You can countermand this default by setting a
   configuration variable in the receiving repository.

   http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/107758/focus=108007

 * refuse push to delete the current branch by default

   Make "git push $there :$killed" to delete the branch that is pointed at
   by its HEAD fail by default.  You can countermand this default by
   setting a configuration variable in the receiving repository.

   http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/108862/focus=108936

 * git-send-email won't make deep threads by default

   Many people said that by default when sending more than 2 patches the
   threading git-send-email makes by default is hard to read, and they
   prefer the default be one cover letter and each patch as a direct
   follow-up to the cover letter.  You can countermand this by setting a
   configuration variable.

   http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/109790

 * git-status won't be "git-commit --dry-run" anymore

   http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/125989/focus=125993

 * "git-diff -w --exit-code" will exit success if only differences it
   found are whitespace changes that are stripped away from the output.

* tf/doc-pt-br (2009-09-23) 1 commit.
 + Documentation: update pt-BR

The current AsciiDoc may barf on NOME and SINOPSE, as pt_BR language

 + apply --whitespace=warn/error: diagnose blank at EOF
 + apply.c: split check_whitespace() into two
 + apply --whitespace=fix: detect new blank lines at eof correctly
 + apply --whitespace=fix: fix handling of blank lines at the eof
 (this branch is used by jc/maint-blank-at-eof.)

This is a fix for an ancient bug (or inconsistent set of features); the
topic is based on an ancient codebase and is designed to be merged
upwards.  jc/maint-blank-at-eof serves that purpose.

 - Add tests for git check-ref-format

* sb/gitweb-link-author (2009-10-14) 1 commit.
 - gitweb: linkify author/committer names with search

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* db/vcs-helper-rest (2009-09-03) 6 commits.
 - Allow helpers to report in "list" command that the ref is unchanged
 - Add support for "import" helper command
 - Add a config option for remotes to specify a foreign vcs
 - Allow programs to not depend on remotes having urls
 - Allow fetch to modify refs
 - Use a function to determine whether a remote is valid
 (this branch is used by jh/cvs-helper.)

This holds the remainder of the db/vcs-helper topic that has already
merged in 1.6.5.  If people want to replace this with improvements it
would be a good time to do so.

* jl/submodule-add-noname (2009-09-22) 1 commit.
 - git submodule add: make the <path> parameter optional

Dscho started an interesting discussion regarding the larger workflow in
which the "submodule add" is used.  I think the patch itself makes sense
but at the same time it probably makes sense to also take the <path> and
infer the <repository> as Dscho suggested, probably in "git submodule
add", not in "git add" proper, at least initially.

* sr/gfi-options (2009-09-06) 6 commits.
 - fast-import: test the new option command
 - fast-import: add option command
 - fast-import: test the new feature command
 - fast-import: add feature command
 - fast-import: put marks reading in it's own function
 - fast-import: put option parsing code in separate functions
 (this branch is used by jh/notes.)

Ejected from 'next' as fast-import folks still seem to be discussing with
how to proceed.

* je/send-email-no-subject (2009-08-05) 1 commit.
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-10-11 at 1b99c56)
 + send-email: confirm on empty mail subjects

The existing tests cover the positive case (i.e. as long as the user says
"yes" to the "do you really want to send this message that lacks subject",
the message is sent) of this feature, but the feature itself needs its own
test to verify the negative case (i.e. does it correctly stop if the user
says "no"?)

* jh/cvs-helper (2009-08-18) 8 commits.
 - More fixes to the git-remote-cvs installation procedure
 - Fix the Makefile-generated path to the git_remote_cvs package in git-remote-cvs
 - Add simple selftests of git-remote-cvs functionality
 - git-remote-cvs: Remote helper program for CVS repositories
 - 2/2: Add Python support library for CVS remote helper
 - 1/2: Add Python support library for CVS remote helper
 - Basic build infrastructure for Python scripts
 - Allow helpers to request marks for fast-import
 (this branch uses db/vcs-helper-rest.)

Builds on db/vcs-helper.

  (merged to 'next' on 2009-10-14 at adf722a)
 + Speedup bash completion loading

 - Smart fetch and push over HTTP: server side
 - Add stateless RPC options to upload-pack, receive-pack

 - imap-send: use run-command API for tunneling
 - imap-send: use separate read and write fds
 - imap-send: remove useless uid code

Is this good to go yet?

* mr/gitweb-snapshot (2009-09-26) 2 commits.
 - gitweb: append short hash ids to snapshot files
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-10-11 at 22ba047)
 + gitweb: check given hash before trying to create snapshot

* jc/pretty-lf (2009-10-04) 1 commit.
 - Pretty-format: %[+-]x to tweak inter-item newlines

* js/log-rewrap (2008-11-10) 2 commits
 - Add strbuf_add_wrapped_text() to utf8.[ch]
 - print_wrapped_text(): allow hard newlines
 (this branch is used by jc/strbuf-nested-expand.)

* js/diff-verbose-submodule (2009-10-14) 4 commits.
 - add tests for git diff --submodule-summary
 - fix output for deleted submodules in git diff --submodule-summary
 - fix indentation depth for git diff --submodule-summary
 - Add the --submodule-summary option to the diff option family

There was an attempted re-roll and it looked very promising with a minor
fix-up, but I ran out of time to pick it up and unilaterally tweaking it.
Waiting for a response.

* jc/fix-tree-walk (2009-09-14) 10 commits.
 - read-tree --debug-unpack
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-10-11 at 0b058e2)
 + unpack-trees.c: look ahead in the index
 + unpack-trees.c: prepare for looking ahead in the index
 + Aggressive three-way merge: fix D/F case
 + traverse_trees(): handle D/F conflict case sanely
 + more D/F conflict tests
 + tests: move convenience regexp to match object names to test-lib.sh
 + unpack_callback(): use unpack_failed() consistently
 + unpack-trees: typofix
 + diff-lib.c: fix misleading comments on oneway_diff()

This is my replacement for Linus's lt/maint-traverse-trees-fix patch.  It
is not so much as a counter-proposal; I originally thought it might make
sense to walk the index and drive the walker to return the entries from
trees to match entries from the index, but I ended up doing pretty much
what Linus outlined --- walk the trees, and have the index walker follow
it.  It turned out that the index side also needed some hairy look-ahead,

This includes the fix to aggressive mode of three-way merge used by the
resolve strategy.

 - gitweb: Minify gitweb.js if JSMIN is defined
 - gitweb: Create links leading to 'blame_incremental' using JavaScript

--------------------------------------------------
[For 1.7.0]

* jk/1.7.0-status (2009-09-05) 5 commits.
 - docs: note that status configuration affects only long format
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-10-11 at 65c8513)
 + commit: support alternate status formats
 + status: add --porcelain output format
 + status: refactor format option parsing
 + status: refactor short-mode printing to its own function
 (this branch uses jc/1.7.0-status.)

Gives the --short output format to post 1.7.0 "git commit --dry-run" that
is similar to that of post 1.7.0 "git status".

* jc/1.7.0-status (2009-09-05) 4 commits.
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-10-11 at 9558627)
 + status: typo fix in usage
 + git status: not "commit --dry-run" anymore
 + git stat -s: short status output
 + git stat: the beginning of "status that is not a dry-run of commit"
 (this branch is used by jk/1.7.0-status.)

With this, "git status" is no longer "git commit --dry-run".

* jc/1.7.0-send-email-no-thread-default (2009-08-22) 1 commit.
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-10-11 at 043acdf)
 + send-email: make --no-chain-reply-to the default

* jc/1.7.0-diff-whitespace-only-status (2009-08-30) 4 commits.
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-10-11 at 546c74d)
 + diff.c: fix typoes in comments
 + Make test case number unique
 + diff: Rename QUIET internal option to QUICK
 + diff: change semantics of "ignore whitespace" options

This changes exit code from "git diff --ignore-whitespace" and friends
when there is no actual output.  It is a backward incompatible change, but
we could argue that it is a bugfix.

* jc/1.7.0-push-safety (2009-02-09) 2 commits.
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-10-11 at 81b8128)
 + Refuse deleting the current branch via push
 + Refuse updating the current branch in a non-bare repository via push

--------------------------------------------------
[I have been too busy to purge these]

* jc/log-tz (2009-03-03) 1 commit.
 - Allow --date=local --date=other-format to work as expected

Maybe some people care about this.  I dunno.

* jc/mailinfo-remove-brackets (2009-07-15) 1 commit.
 - mailinfo: -b option keeps [bracketed] strings that is not a [PATCH] marker

Maybe some people care about this.  I dunno.

* ne/rev-cache (2009-09-07) 7 commits.
 . support for commit grafts, slight change to general mechanism
 . support for path name caching in rev-cache
 . full integration of rev-cache into git, completed test suite
 . administrative functions for rev-cache, start of integration into git
 . support for non-commit object caching in rev-cache
 . basic revision cache system, no integration or features
 . man page and technical discussion for rev-cache

This seems to break at least t6001 when merged to 'pu'.

* jg/log-format-body-indent (2009-09-19) 1 commit.
 . git-log --format: Add %B tag with %B(x) option

Ejected from 'pu' as this is merely a short-hand for %[wrap(0,x,x)%b%].
