What's cooking in git.git (Oct 2019, #03; Fri, 11)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

I've been offline for a week or so, and have been trying to process
the backlog, but I am sure there are still things to be picked up.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

  (merged to 'next' on 2019-10-03 at 969ec06cc7)

* js/diff-rename-force-stable-sort (2019-10-02) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-10-04 at e02d882510)
 + diffcore_rename(): use a stable sort
 + Move git_sort(), a stable sort, into into libgit.a

 The rename detection logic sorts a list of rename source candidates
 by similarity to pick the best candidate, which means that a tie
 between sources with the same similarity is broken by the original
 location in the original candidate list (which is sorted by path).
 Force the sorting by similarity done with a stable sort, which is
 not promised by system supplied qsort(3), to ensure consistent
 results across platforms.


* js/mingw-spawn-with-spaces-in-path (2019-10-02) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-10-04 at 0fdb87dd53)

 Test fix.


* js/range-diff-noprefix (2019-10-03) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-10-04 at 56cf767bdb)
 + range-diff: internally force `diff.noprefix=true`

 "git range-diff" segfaulted when diff.noprefix configuration was
 used, as it blindly expected the patch it internally generates to
 have the standard a/ and b/ prefixes.  The command now forces the
 internal patch to be built without any prefix, not to be affected
 by any end-user configuration.


* js/stash-apply-in-secondary-worktree (2019-10-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-10-07 at b3474c9c3d)
 + stash apply: report status correctly even in a worktree's subdirectory

 "git stash apply" in a subdirectory of a secondary worktree failed
 to access the worktree correctly, which has been corrected.

 + rebase -i: check for updated todo after squash and reword

 (this branch is used by ra/rebase-i-more-options.)

 "git rebase -i" showed a wrong HEAD while "reword" open the editor.

  (merged to 'next' on 2019-10-07 at 9d0e27b5c3)
 + convert: fix handling of dashless UTF prefix in validate_encoding()

 The code to skip "UTF" and "UTF-" prefix, when computing an advice
 message, did not work correctly when the prefix was "UTF", which
 has been fixed.


* rs/dedup-includes (2019-10-04) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-10-07 at 5a4fc44657)

 Integer arithmetic fix.


* tk/git-svn-trim-author-name (2019-09-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-10-04 at c1c619f7c4)
 + git-svn: trim leading and trailing whitespaces in author name

 The author names taken from SVN repositories may have extra leading
 or trailing whitespaces, which are now munged away.

[New Topics]

* ds/sparse-cone (2019-10-08) 17 commits
 - sparse-checkout: cone mode should not interact with .gitignore

 "git range-diff" failed to handle mode-only change, which has been
 corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 - format-patch: learn --infer-cover-subject option

 "git format-patch --cover-letter" learned to optionally use the
 first paragraph (typically a single-liner) of branch.*.description
 as the subject of the cover letter.

 Reroll with a redesign with less emphasis on "subject" coming?


* jn/unknown-index-extensions (2018-11-21) 2 commits
 - index: offer advice for unknown index extensions

 A bit too alarming warning given when unknown index extensions
 exist is getting revamped.

 Expecting a reroll.


* jc/format-patch-delay-message-id (2019-04-05) 1 commit
 - format-patch: move message-id and related headers to the end

 The location "git format-patch --thread" adds the Message-Id:
 header in the series of header fields has been moved down, which
 may help working around a suspected bug in GMail MSA, reported at
 <CAHk-=whP1stFZNAaJiMi5eZ9rj0MRt20Y_yHVczZPH+O01d+sA@mail.gmail.com>

 Waiting for feedback to see if it truly helps.
 Needs tests.

 the pack contents to be instead taken from elsewhere (aka CDN).


* js/protocol-advertise-multi (2018-12-28) 1 commit
 - protocol: advertise multiple supported versions

 The transport layer has been updated so that the protocol version
 used can be negotiated between the parties, by the initiator
 listing the protocol versions it is willing to talk, and the other
 side choosing from one of them.

 Expecting a reroll.

* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2018-10-15) 1 commit
 - zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

 + docs: clarify trace2 version invariants
 + docs: mention trace2 target-dir mode in git-config

 The trace2 output, when sending them to files in a designated

 mechanism is introduced to set the maximum number of files and
 discard further logs when the maximum is reached.

 Will merge to 'master'.

* bw/format-patch-o-create-leading-dirs (2019-10-06) 1 commit
 - format-patch: create leading components of output directory

 "git format-patch -o <outdir>" did an equivalent of "mkdir <outdir>"
 not "mkdir -p <outdir>", which is being corrected.

 Use of adjust shared perm on the leading directory may have
 security implictions.

  (merged to 'next' on 2019-10-07 at e798bac35d)
 + fetch: let --jobs=<n> parallelize --multiple, too

 "git fetch --jobs=<n>" allowed <n> parallel jobs when fetching
 submodules, but this did not apply to "git fetch --multiple" that

* mt/threaded-grep-in-object-store (2019-10-02) 11 commits
 - grep: move driver pre-load out of critical section
 - grep: re-enable threads in non-worktree case
 - grep: protect packed_git [re-]initialization
 - grep: allow submodule functions to run in parallel
 - submodule-config: add skip_if_read option to repo_read_gitmodules()

 - replace-object: make replace operations thread-safe
 - grep: fix racy calls in grep_objects()
 - grep: fix race conditions at grep_submodule()
 - grep: fix race conditions on userdiff calls

 Traditionally, we avoided threaded grep while searching in objects
 (as opposed to files in the working tree) as accesses to the object
 layer is not thread-safe.  This limitation is getting lifted.

* js/builtin-add-i (2019-08-30) 11 commits
 . built-in add -i: implement the `help` command
 . built-in add -i: use color in the main loop
 . built-in add -i: support `?` (prompt help)
 . built-in add -i: show unique prefixes of the commands
 . Add a function to determine unique prefixes for a list of strings
 . built-in add -i: implement the main loop
 . built-in add -i: color the header in the `status` command
 . built-in add -i: refresh the index before running `status`
 . built-in add -i: implement the `status` command
 . diff: export diffstat interface
 . Start to implement a built-in version of `git add --interactive`

 The beginning of rewriting "git add -i" in C.

 On hold, waiting for tg/stash-refresh-index to work well with this.

* vn/reset-deleted-ita (2019-07-26) 1 commit
 - reset: unstage empty deleted ita files

 "git reset HEAD [<pathspec>]" did not reset an empty file that was
 added with the intent-to-add bit.

 Expecting a reroll.


* ra/rebase-i-more-options (2019-09-09) 6 commits
 - rebase: add --reset-author-date
 - rebase -i: support --ignore-date
 - sequencer: rename amend_author to author_to_rename
 - rebase -i: support --committer-date-is-author-date
 - sequencer: allow callers of read_author_script() to ignore fields
 - rebase -i: add --ignore-whitespace flag

 "git rebase -i" learned a few options that are known by "git
 rebase" proper.

 Needs to consider existing GIT_COMMITTER_DATE environment, etc.

* jc/format-patch-noclobber (2019-02-22) 1 commit
 - format-patch: --no-clobber refrains from overwriting output files

 "git format-patch" used to overwrite an existing patch/cover-letter
 file.  A new "--no-clobber" option stops it.

 Will discard.

[Discarded]

* dl/remote-save-to-push (2018-12-11) 1 commit
 . remote: add --save-to-push option to git remote set-url

 "git remote set-url" learned a new option that moves existing value
 of the URL field to pushURL field of the remote before replacing
 the URL field with a new value.

 Anybody who wants to champion this topic?
 I am personally not yet quite convinced if this is worth pursuing.


* js/trace2-json-schema (2019-07-25) 3 commits
 . ci: run trace2 schema validation in the CI suite
 . trace2: add a schema validator for trace2 events
 . trace2: add a JSON schema for trace2 events

 The JSON output produced by "trace2" subsystem now has JSON schema
 defined on it, to allow us validate the output and catch deviation.

 Abandoned, at least for now.

 . fetch: add the fetch.jobs config key
 . fetch: add the "--fetch-jobs" option
 . fetch: rename max_children to max_children_for_submodules

 "git fetch --jobs" is getting taught to also run fetch jobs in
 parallel when fetching from multiple remote repositories.

 Build fix to make sure hdr-check is run with the same preprocessor
 macros predefined by the $(MAKE) procedure.

 Superseded by dl/honor-cflags-in-hdr-check series.
