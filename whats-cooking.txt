What's cooking in git.git (Jun 2024, #02; Thu, 6)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and
aren't considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL
to a message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity (of course they can be resubmit when new interests
arise).

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-scm/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

Release tarballs are available at:

[New Topics]

* rj/add-p-pager (2024-06-04) 6 commits
 - add-patch: introduce the command '|'
 - test-terminal: introduce --no-stdin-pty
 - pager: introduce setup_custom_pager
 - pager: introduce wait_for_pager
 - pager: do not close fd 2 unnecessarily
 - add-patch: test for 'p' command

 "git add -i" and friends learned a new '|' command that sends the
 current hunk to the pager, instead of dumping it to the terminal.

 Expecting a reroll.

 material other than password (whose support was added recently),
 which has been corrected.

 The "--heads" option of "ls-remote" and "show-ref" has been been
 deprecated; "--branches" replaces "--heads".

 - diff: let external diffs report that changes are uninteresting
 - userdiff: add and use struct external_diff
 - t4020: test exit code with external diffs

 "git diff --exit-code --ext-diff" learned to take the exit status
 of the external diff driver into account when deciding the exit
 status of the overall "git diff" invocation when configured to do
 so.

 Expecting a bit of documentation updates.

* cc/upload-pack-missing-action (2024-05-24) 3 commits
 - upload-pack: allow configuring a missing-action
 - pack-objects: use the missing action API
 - rev-list: refactor --missing=<missing-action>

 Allow a server S that is a lazy clone of another repository X to
 respond to a request by C that is a lazy clone of S in a way that
 it omits objects it itself does not have (and has to be lazily
 fetched from X).

 I would say this is a terribly irresponsive design, especially
 there is no negociation for S to learn if the objects it is going
 to omit is obtainable by C from elsewhere.

 - rebase -i: improve error message when picking merge
 - rebase -i: pass struct replay_opts to parse_insn_line()

 When the user adds to "git rebase -i" instruction to "pick" a merge
 commit, the error experience is not pleasant.  Such an error is now
 caught earlier in the process that parses the todo list.

 Expecting a reroll.
