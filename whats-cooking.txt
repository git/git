What's cooking in git.git (Jun 2019, #04; Fri, 14)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

The first batch of topics post 2.22 are now in 'master'.  Let's thin
down what are left in 'next' before taking anything new, and try to
keep this cycle short.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* ab/deprecate-R-for-dynpath (2019-05-19) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-05-19 at 944976e981)
 + Makefile: remove the NO_R_TO_GCC_LINKER flag

 The way of specifying the path to find dynamic libraries at runtime
 has been simplified.  The old default to pass -R/path/to/dir has been
 replaced with the new default to pass -Wl,-rpath,/path/to/dir,
 which is the more recent GCC uses.  Those who need to build with an
 old GCC can still use "CC_LD_DYNPATH=-R"


* ab/fail-prereqs-in-test (2019-05-14) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-05-16 at d1be55f485)
 + tests: add a special setup where prerequisites fail

 Developer support to emulate unsatisfied prerequisites in tests to
 ensure that the remainer of the tests still succeeds when tests
 with prerequisites are skipped.


* ab/send-email-transferencoding-fix (2019-05-29) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-05-29 at c8a99d18c0)
 + send-email: fix regression in sendemail.identity parsing
 + send-email: document --no-[to|cc|bcc]
 + send-email: fix broken transferEncoding tests
 + send-email: remove cargo-culted multi-patch pattern in tests
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-05-13 at 38c6a1e7e0)
 + send-email: do defaults -> config -> getopt in that order
 + send-email: rename the @bcclist variable for consistency
 + send-email: move the read_config() function above getopts

 Since "git send-email" learned to take 'auto' as the value for the
 transfer-encoding, it by mistake stopped honoring the values given
 to the configuration variables sendemail.transferencoding and/or
 sendemail.<ident>.transferencoding.  This has been corrected to
 (finally) redoing the order of setting the default, reading the
 configuration and command line options.


* dl/format-patch-notes-config (2019-05-17) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-05-19 at d3f6f1872b)
 + format-patch: teach format.notes config option
 + git-format-patch.txt: document --no-notes option

 "git format-patch" learns a configuration to set the default for
 its --notes=<ref> option.


* en/fast-export-encoding (2019-05-14) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-05-16 at c88bd3edb5)
 + fast-export: do automatic reencoding of commit messages only if requested
 + fast-export: differentiate between explicitly UTF-8 and implicitly UTF-8
 + fast-export: avoid stripping encoding header if we cannot reencode
 + fast-import: support 'encoding' commit header
 + t9350: fix encoding test to actually test reencoding

 The "git fast-export/import" pair has been taught to handle commits
 with log messages in encoding other than UTF-8 better.


* ew/update-server-info (2019-05-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-05-19 at bf4f2871ab)
 + update-server-info: avoid needless overwrites

 "git update-server-info" learned not to rewrite the file with the
 same contents.


* jk/help-unknown-ref-fix (2019-05-15) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-05-19 at e3e01160f7)
 + help_unknown_ref(): check for refname ambiguity
 + help_unknown_ref(): duplicate collected refnames

 Improve the code to show args with potential typo that cannot be
 interpreted as a commit-ish.


* jk/unused-params-final-batch (2019-05-13) 14 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-05-15 at ef7435264c)
 + verify-commit: simplify parameters to run_gpg_verify()
 + show-branch: drop unused parameter from show_independent()
 + rev-list: drop unused void pointer from finish_commit()
 + remove_all_fetch_refspecs(): drop unused "remote" parameter
 + receive-pack: drop unused "commands" from prepare_shallow_update()
 + pack-objects: drop unused rev_info parameters
 + name-rev: drop unused parameters from is_better_name()
 + mktree: drop unused length parameter
 + wt-status: drop unused status parameter
 + read-cache: drop unused parameter from threaded load
 + clone: drop dest parameter from copy_alternates()
 + submodule: drop unused prefix parameter from some functions
 + builtin: consistently pass cmd_* prefix to parse_options
 + cmd_{read,write}_tree: rename "unused" variable that is used

 Remove many unused parameters throughout the codebase, with the
 ultimate aim to allow us compile with -Wunused-parameter cleanly.


* js/rebase-cleanup (2019-05-15) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-05-16 at ccfed8f263)
 + rebase: fold git-rebase--common into the -p backend
 + sequencer: the `am` and `rebase--interactive` scripts are gone
 + .gitignore: there is no longer a built-in `git-rebase--interactive`
 + t3400: stop referring to the scripted rebase
 + Drop unused git-rebase--am.sh

 Update supporting parts of "git rebase" to remove code that should
 no longer be used.


* mh/import-transport-fd-fix (2019-05-16) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-05-19 at 5e86f92f7a)
 + Use xmmap_gently instead of xmmap in use_pack
 + dup() the input fd for fast-import used for remote helpers

 The ownership rule for the file descriptor to fast-import remote
 backend was mixed up, leading to unrelated file descriptor getting
 closed, which has been fixed.


* nd/corrupt-worktrees (2019-05-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-05-16 at d92c25f800)
 + worktree add: be tolerant of corrupt worktrees

 "git worktree add" used to fail when another worktree connected to
 the same repository was corrupt, which has been corrected.


* nd/init-relative-template-fix (2019-05-13) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-05-15 at 4d5b17f712)
 + init: make --template path relative to $CWD

 A relative pathname given to "git init --template=<path> <repo>"
 ought to be relative to the directory "git init" gets invoked in,
 but it instead was made relative to the repository, which has been
 corrected.


* nd/merge-quit (2019-05-19) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-05-19 at 9880e7ee4e)
 + merge: add --quit
 + merge: remove drop_save() in favor of remove_merge_branch_state()

 "git merge" learned "--quit" option that cleans up the in-progress
 merge while leaving the working tree and the index still in a mess.


* nd/worktree-name-sanitization (2019-05-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-05-16 at 9a2dd33122)
 + worktree add: sanitize worktree names

 In recent versions of Git, per-worktree refs are exposed in
 refs/worktrees/<wtname>/ hierarchy, which means that worktree names
 must be a valid refname component.  The code now sanitizes the names
 given to worktrees, to make sure these refs are well-formed.


* pw/rebase-edit-message-for-replayed-merge (2019-05-19) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-05-19 at dc3e30641c)
 + rebase -r: always reword merge -c

 A "merge -c" instruction during "git rebase --rebase-merges" should
 give the user a chance to edit the log message, even when there is
 otherwise no need to create a new merge and replace the existing
 one (i.e. fast-forward instead), but did not.  Which has been
 corrected.


* sb/format-patch-base-patch-id-fix (2019-05-08) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-05-15 at 1ab7d2b71c)
 + format-patch: make --base patch-id output stable
 + format-patch: inform user that patch-id generation is unstable

 The "--base" option of "format-patch" computed the patch-ids for
 prerequisite patches in an unstable way, which has been updated to
 compute in a way that is compatible with "git patch-id --stable".

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* js/gcc-8-and-9 (2019-06-13) 4 commits
 - config: avoid calling `labs()` on too-large data type
 - winansi: simplify loading the GetCurrentConsoleFontEx() function
 - kwset: allow building with GCC 8
 - poll (mingw): allow compiling with GCC 8 and DEVELOPER=1

 Code clean-up for new compilers.

 The 'kwset' one may want to be discussed a bit longer.  Perhaps
 merge the other three earlier to 'next' and then to 'master'
 separately?


* pw/add-p-recount (2019-06-13) 1 commit
 - add -p: fix checkout -p with pathological context

 "git checkout -p" needs to selectively apply a patch in reverse,
 which did not work well.

 Will merge to 'next' and then to 'master'.


* rs/avoid-overflow-in-midpoint-computation (2019-06-13) 1 commit
 - cleanup: fix possible overflow errors in binary search, part 2

 - t3404: fix a typo

 Typofix.

 Will merge to 'next' and then to 'master'.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* jn/unknown-index-extensions (2018-11-21) 2 commits
 - index: offer advice for unknown index extensions
 - index: do not warn about unrecognized extensions

 A bit too alarming warning given when unknown index extensions
 exist is getting revamped.

 Expecting a reroll.


* jc/format-patch-delay-message-id (2019-04-05) 1 commit
 - format-patch: move message-id and related headers to the end

 The location "git format-patch --thread" adds the Message-Id:
 header in the series of header fields has been moved down, which
 may help working around a suspected bug in GMail MSA, reported at
 <CAHk-=whP1stFZNAaJiMi5eZ9rj0MRt20Y_yHVczZPH+O01d+sA@mail.gmail.com>

 Waiting for feedback to see if it truly helps.
 Needs tests.


* jt/fetch-cdn-offload (2019-03-12) 9 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - upload-pack: send part of packfile response as uri
 - fetch-pack: support more than one pack lockfile
 - upload-pack: refactor reading of pack-objects out
 - Documentation: add Packfile URIs design doc
 - Documentation: order protocol v2 sections
 - http-fetch: support fetching packfiles by URL
 - http: improve documentation of http_pack_request
 - http: use --stdin when getting dumb HTTP pack

 WIP for allowing a response to "git fetch" to instruct the bulk of
 the pack contents to be instead taken from elsewhere (aka CDN).

 Stalled


* js/protocol-advertise-multi (2018-12-28) 1 commit
 - protocol: advertise multiple supported versions

 The transport layer has been updated so that the protocol version
 used can be negotiated between the parties, by the initiator
 listing the protocol versions it is willing to talk, and the other
 side choosing from one of them.

 Expecting a reroll.
 cf. <CANq=j3u-zdb_FvNJGPCmygNMScseav63GhVvBX3NcVS4f7TejA@mail.gmail.com>


* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2018-10-15) 1 commit
 - zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".


* dl/remote-save-to-push (2018-12-11) 1 commit
 - remote: add --save-to-push option to git remote set-url

 "git remote set-url" learned a new option that moves existing value
 of the URL field to pushURL field of the remote before replacing
 the URL field with a new value.

 Anybody who wants to champion this topic?
 I am personally not yet quite convinced if this is worth pursuing.

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* mo/hpux-dynpath (2019-06-07) 1 commit
 - configure: Detect linking style for HP aCC on HP-UX

 Auto-detect how to tell HP-UX aCC where to use dynamicallly linked

 - t7610-mergetool: do not place pipelines headed by `yes` in subshells

 "git mergetool" and its tests now spawn fewer subprocesses.

 Will merge to 'next' and then to 'master'.


* cc/test-oidmap (2019-06-13) 3 commits
 - oidmap: use sha1hash() instead of static hash() function
 - t: add t0016-oidmap.sh

 "git multi-pack-index" learned expire and repack subcommands.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* md/sort-detached-head-first (2019-06-11) 1 commit
 - ref-filter: sort detached HEAD lines firstly

 "git branch --list" learned to always output the detached HEAD as
 the first item (when the HEAD is detached, of course), instead of
 relying on the textual order of sorting

 At least the test needs to be redone.


* nd/completion-no-cache-failure (2019-06-12) 1 commit
 - completion: do not cache if --git-completion-helper fails

 An incorrect list of options was cached after command line
 completion failed (e.g. trying to complete a command that requires
 a repository outside one), which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next' and then to 'master'.

 - t3404-rebase-interactive: use the 'q_to_cr' helper

 Use "Erase in Line" CSI sequence that is already used in the editor
 support to clear cruft in the progress output.

 Its test may have to be updated to work around glitch in test setup
 on Windows.


* sg/trace2-rename (2019-06-12) 1 commit
 - Revert "test-lib: whitelist GIT_TR2_* in the environment"

 "import" based transports.

 Will merge to 'next' and then to 'master'.


* jl/status-reduce-vertical-blank (2019-06-04) 1 commit
 - status: remove the empty line after hints
 (this branch uses nd/switch-and-restore.)

 Extra blank lines in "git status" output have been reduced.

 Needs to wait on nd/switch-and-restore to stabilize.


* md/url-parse-harden (2019-06-04) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-06-06 at b187c3dbfe)
 + url: do not allow %00 to represent NUL in URLs
 + url: do not read past end of buffer

 The URL decoding code has been updated to avoid going past the end
 of the string while parsing %-<hex>-<hex> sequence.

 Will merge to 'master'.

  (merged to 'next' on 2019-06-06 at ee3066bb65)
 + clang-format: use git grep to generate the ForEachMacros list

 The list of for-each like macros used by clang-format has been
 updated.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 Doc update.

 Will merge to 'next' and then to 'master'.


* dl/includeif-onbranch (2019-06-05) 1 commit
 - config: learn the "onbranch:" includeIf condition

 The conditional inclusion mechanism learned to base the choice on
 the branch the HEAD currently is on.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 (this branch uses ds/commit-graph-write-refactor; is tangled with ds/close-object-store.)

 The commits in a repository can be described by multiple
 commit-graph files now, which allows the commit-graph files to be
 updated incrementally.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* tm/tag-gpgsign-config (2019-06-05) 1 commit
 - tag: add tag.gpgSign config option to force all tags be GPG-signed

 A new tag.gpgSign configuration variable turns "git tag -a" into
 "git tag -s".

* md/list-objects-filter-memfix (2019-05-31) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-06-06 at 80f0187cef)
 + list-objects-filter: correct usage of ALLOC_GROW

 The filter_data used in the list-objects-filter (which manages a
 lazily sparse clone repository) did not use the dynamic array API
 correctly---'nr' is supposed to point at one past the last element
 of the array in use.  This has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* md/list-objects-filter-parse-msgfix (2019-05-31) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-06-06 at 736f3c175b)

  (merged to 'next' on 2019-05-29 at 655ba18f30)
 + server-info: do not list unlinked packs

 "git update-server-info" used to leave stale packfiles in its
 output, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.

  (merged to 'next' on 2019-05-29 at c2cfe38955)

 The server side support for "git fetch" used to show incorrect
 value for the HEAD symbolic ref when the namespace feature is in
 use, which has been corrected.

 + am: drop tty requirement for --interactive
 + am: read interactive input from stdin

  (merged to 'next' on 2019-05-29 at 747fbbaf11)
 + bundle verify: error out if called without an object database

 "git bundle verify" needs to see if prerequisite objects exist in
 the receiving repository, but the command did not check if we are
 in a repository upfront, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* js/fsmonitor-unflake (2019-05-28) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-05-30 at 1aa850bc59)
 + mark_fsmonitor_valid(): mark the index as changed if needed
 + fill_stat_cache_info(): prepare for an fsmonitor fix

 The data collected by fsmonitor was not properly written back to
 the on-disk index file, breaking t7519 tests occasionally, which
 has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* mm/p4-unshelve-windows-fix (2019-05-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-05-31 at d45167d723)
 + p4 unshelve: fix "Not a valid object name HEAD0" on Windows

 The command line to invoke a "git cat-file" command from inside
 "git p4" was not properly quoted to protect a caret and running a
 broken command on Windows, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* pb/request-pull-verify-remote-ref (2019-05-28) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-05-31 at 0f73300dfa)
 + request-pull: warn if the remote object is not the same as the local one
 + request-pull: quote regex metacharacters in local ref

 "git request-pull" learned to warn when the ref we ask them to pull
 from in the local repository and in the published repository are
 different.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* po/git-help-on-git-itself (2019-05-16) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-05-31 at 455541d73a)
 + Doc: git.txt: remove backticks from link and add git-scm.com/docs
 + git.c: show usage for accessing the git(1) help page

 "git help git" was hard to discover (well, at least for some
 people).

 Will merge to 'master'.


* sw/git-p4-unshelve-branched-files (2019-05-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-05-30 at e1985f61fc)

* vv/merge-squash-with-explicit-commit (2019-05-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-05-29 at 209baa3e55)
 + merge: refuse --commit with --squash

 "git merge --squash" is designed to update the working tree and the
 index without creating the commit, and this cannot be countermanded
 by adding the "--commit" option; the command now refuses to work
 when both options are given.

 + clone: respect user supplied origin name when setting up partial clone

 When creating a partial clone, the object filtering criteria is
 recorded for the origin of the clone, but this incorrectly used a
 hardcoded name "origin" to name that remote; it has been corrected
 to honor the "--origin <name>" option.

  (merged to 'next' on 2019-05-29 at 5d7573a151)
 + index-pack: prefetch missing REF_DELTA bases
 + t5616: refactor packfile replacement

 "git fetch" into a lazy clone forgot to fetch base objects that are
 necessary to complete delta in a thin packfile, which has been
 corrected.

 The pattern "git diff/grep" use to extract funcname and words
 boundary for Matlab has been extend to cover Octave, which is more
 or less equivalent.

  (merged to 'next' on 2019-05-29 at 71972f94c2)
 + clone: add `--remote-submodules` flag

 "git clone --recurse-submodules" learned to set up the submodules
 to ignore commit object names recorded in the superproject gitlink
 and instead use the commits that happen to be at the tip of the
 remote-tracking branches from the get-go, by passing the new
 "--remote-submodules" option.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ds/close-object-store (2019-06-12) 3 commits
 - packfile: rename close_all_packs to close_object_store
 - packfile: close commit-graph in close_all_packs
 - commit-graph: use raw_object_store when closing
 (this branch uses ds/commit-graph-write-refactor; is tangled with ds/commit-graph-incremental.)

 The commit-graph file is now part of the "files that the runtime
 may keep open file descriptors on, all of which would need to be
 closed when done with the object store", and the file descriptor to
 an existing commit-graph file now is closed before "gc" finalizes a
 new instance to replace it.

 Will merge to 'next' and then to 'master'.

 The pattern "git diff/grep" use to extract funcname and words
 boundary for Rust has been added.

 - rebase: fix a memory leak

 "git rebase --abort" used to leave refs/rewritten/ when concluding
 "git rebase -r", which has been corrected.

 On hold.

 "git branch --list" learned to show branches that are checked out
 in other worktrees connected to the same repository prefixed with
 '+', similar to the way the currently checked out branch is shown
 with '*' in front.

 advancing the current history" out of the single "git checkout"
 command.

* jc/format-patch-noclobber (2019-02-22) 1 commit
 - format-patch: --no-clobber refrains from overwriting output files

 "git format-patch" used to overwrite an existing patch/cover-letter
 file.  A new "--no-clobber" option stops it.

 Undecided but inclined to discard.

 - rebase: fast-forward --onto in more cases
 - rebase: refactor can_fast_forward into goto tower
 - t3432: test rebase fast-forward behavior
 - t3431: add rebase --fork-point tests

 "git rebase --keep-base <upstream>" tries to find the original base
 of the topic being rebased and rebase on top of that same base,
 which is useful when running the "git rebase -i" (and its limited
 variant "git rebase -x").

 The command also has learned to fast-forward in more cases where it
 can instead of replaying to recreate identical commits.

 On hold.
