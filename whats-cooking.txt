What's cooking in git.git (Apr 2018, #04; Mon, 30)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* cc/perf-aggregate-unknown-option (2018-04-26) 1 commit
 - perf/aggregate: use Getopt::Long for option parsing

 Perf-test helper updates.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ab/perl-python-attrs (2018-04-27) 3 commits
 - .gitattributes: add a diff driver for Python
 - .gitattributes: use the "perl" differ for Perl
 - .gitattributes: add *.pl extension for Perl

 We learned that our source files with ".pl" and ".py" extensions
 are Perl and Python files respectively and changes to them are
 better viewed as such with appropriate diff drivers.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* is/parsing-line-range (2018-04-27) 2 commits
 . log: prevent error if line range ends past end of file
 . blame: prevent error if range ends past end of file

 Parsing of -L[<N>][,[<M>]] parameters "git blame" and "git log"
 take has been tweaked.

 Seems to break a few tests.


* js/test-unset-prereq (2018-04-30) 1 commit
 - tests: introduce test_unset_prereq, for debugging

 Test debugging aid.

 Will merge to 'next'.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* ld/p4-unshelve (2018-02-22) 1 commit
 - git-p4: add unshelve command

 "git p4" learned to "unshelve" shelved commit from P4.

 Will hold, perhaps drop and use format-change that uses a proper "diff".
 cf. <CAE5ih7_ooDMqVtTMoQ70s5XCkncr04HY0JkqSp1UmKQeG81oaA@mail.gmail.com>


* av/fsmonitor-updates (2018-01-04) 6 commits
 - fsmonitor: use fsmonitor data in `git diff`
 - fsmonitor: remove debugging lines from t/t7519-status-fsmonitor.sh
 - fsmonitor: make output of test-dump-fsmonitor more concise
 - fsmonitor: update helper tool, now that flags are filled later
 - fsmonitor: stop inline'ing mark_fsmonitor_valid / _invalid
 - dir.c: update comments to match argument name

 Code clean-up on fsmonitor integration, plus optional utilization
 of the fsmonitor data in diff-files.

 Waiting for an update.
 cf. <alpine.DEB.2.21.1.1801042335130.32@MININT-6BKU6QN.europe.corp.microsoft.com>


* pb/bisect-helper-2 (2017-10-28) 8 commits
 - t6030: make various test to pass GETTEXT_POISON tests
 - bisect--helper: `bisect_start` shell function partially in C
 - bisect--helper: `get_terms` & `bisect_terms` shell function in C
 - bisect--helper: `bisect_next_check` shell function in C
 - bisect--helper: `check_and_set_terms` shell function in C
 - wrapper: move is_empty_file() and rename it as is_empty_or_missing_file()
 - bisect--helper: `bisect_write` shell function in C
 - bisect--helper: `bisect_reset` shell function in C

 Expecting a reroll.

* mk/http-backend-content-length (2017-11-27) 4 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - t5560-http-backend-noserver.sh: add CONTENT_LENGTH cases
 - SQUASH???
 - http-backend: respect CONTENT_LENGTH as specified by rfc3875

 The http-backend (used for smart-http transport) used to slurp the
 whole input until EOF, without paying attention to CONTENT_LENGTH
 that is supplied in the environment and instead expecting the Web
 server to close the input stream.  This has been fixed.

 Expecting a reroll.
 Suggested fixes to be used when rerolling is queued, but I'd
 prefer _not_ squashing them myself.

 Also, it may be too complex solution for the problem.
 cf. <20171204171308.GA13332@sigill.intra.peff.net>


* jk/drop-ancient-curl (2017-08-09) 5 commits

 - http: drop support for curl < 7.19.4
 - http: drop support for curl < 7.16.0
 - http: drop support for curl < 7.11.1

 Some code in http.c that has bitrot is being removed.

 Expecting a reroll.


* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2017-08-10) 1 commit
 . zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

 Needs resurrecting by making sure the fix is good and still applies
 (or adjusted to today's codebase).

* fg/completion-external (2018-04-30) 1 commit
 - completion: load completion file for external subcommand

 The command line completion mechanism (in contrib/) learned to load
 custom completion file for "git $command" where $command is a
 custom "git-$command" that the end user has on the $PATH when using
 newer version of bash.


* ma/double-dashes-in-docs (2018-04-18) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-25 at aaac2dc63c)

  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-25 at 0367d52a4b)
 + worktree: accept -f as short for --force for removal

 "git worktree remove" learned that "-f" is a shorthand for
 "--force" option, just like for "git worktree add".

 Will merge to 'master'.


* sg/completion-clear-cached (2018-04-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-25 at 9178da6c3d)
 + completion: reduce overhead of clearing cached --options

 The completion script (in contrib/) learned to clear cached list of
 command line options upon dot-sourcing it again in a more efficient
 way.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* sg/doc-gc-quote-mismatch-fix (2018-04-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-25 at bc3d1abf45)
 + docs/git-gc: fix minor rendering issue

 Doc formatting fix.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* js/ident-date-fix (2018-04-19) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-30 at d50ec2f4c1)
 + sequencer: reset the committer date before commits

 During a "rebase -i" session, the code could give older timestamp
 to commits created by later "pick" than an earlier "reword", which
 has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* nd/submodule-status-fix (2018-04-19) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-30 at 34d1f9ca83)
 + submodule--helper: don't print null in 'submodule status'

 "git submodule status" did not check the symbolic revision name it
 computed for the submodule HEAD is not the NULL, and threw it at
 printf routines, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* sa/send-email-dedup-some-headers (2018-04-19) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-30 at 2a1fd8217e)
 + send-email: avoid duplicate In-Reply-To/References

 When fed input that already has In-Reply-To: and/or References:
 headers and told to add the same information, "git send-email"
 added these headers separately, instead of appending to an existing
 one, which is a violation of the RFC.  This has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* tg/demote-stash-save-in-completion (2018-04-20) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-30 at 93d0af5375)
 + completion: make stash -p and alias for stash push -p
 + completion: stop showing 'save' for stash by default

 The command line completion (in contrib/) has been taught that "git
 stash save" has been deprecated ("git stash push" is the preferred
 spelling in the new world) and does not offer it as a possible
 completion candidate when "git stash push" can be.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* tz/doc-git-urls-reference (2018-04-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-30 at 39926c99fd)
 + doc/clone: update caption for GIT URLS cross-reference

 - replace: "libify" create_graft() and callees
 - replace: avoid using die() to indicate a bug
 - commit: Let the callback of for_each_mergetag return on error
 - argv_array: offer to split a string by whitespace

 The functionality of "$GIT_DIR/info/grafts" has been superseded by
 the "refs/replace/" mechanism for some time now, but the internal
 code had support for it in many places, which has been cleaned up
 in order to drop support of the "grafts" mechanism.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* js/rebase-i-clean-msg-after-fixup-continue (2018-04-30) 4 commits
 - rebase --skip: clean up commit message after a failed fixup/squash
 - sequencer: always commit without editing when asked for
 - rebase -i: Handle "combination of <n> commits" with GETTEXT_POISON
 - rebase -i: demonstrate bugs with fixup!/squash! commit messages

 "git rebase -i" sometimes left intermediate "# This is a
 combination of N commits" message meant for the human consumption
 inside an editor in the final result in certain corner cases, which
 has been fixed.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ma/fast-export-skip-merge-fix (2018-04-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-30 at f7fca02ab1)
 + fast-export: fix regression skipping some merge-commits

 "git fast-export" had a regression in v2.15.0 era where it skipped

* jc/parseopt-expiry-errors (2018-04-23) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-30 at 637085f3d8)
 + parseopt: handle malformed --expire arguments more nicely
 + gc: do not upcase error message shown with die()

 "git gc --prune=nonsense" spent long time repacking and then
 silently failed when underlying "git prune --expire=nonsense"
 failed to parse its command line.  This has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* js/colored-push-errors (2018-04-24) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-30 at 31076c52a2)
 + config: document the settings to colorize push errors/hints

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ma/http-walker-no-partial (2018-04-24) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-30 at 4582c99ba8)
 + walker: drop fields of `struct walker` which are always 1
 + http-fetch: make `-a` standard behaviour

 "git http-fetch" (deprecated) had an optional and experimental
 "feature" to fetch only commits and/or trees, which nobody used.
 This has been removed.

 - bisect: create 'bisect_flags' parameter in find_bisection()

 Preliminary code update to allow passing more flags down the
 bisection codepath in the future.

 + Merge branch 'bw/c-plus-plus' into ds/lazy-load-trees
 (this branch is used by ds/generation-numbers; uses ds/commit-graph.)

 The code has been taught to use the duplicated information stored
 in the commit-graph file to learn the tree object name for a commit
 to avoid opening and parsing the commit object when it makes sense
 to do so.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ab/git-svn-get-record-typofix (2018-04-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-30 at 23f875f6b9)
 + git-svn: avoid warning on undef readline()

 "git svn" had a minor thinko/typo which has been fixed.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* hn/sort-ls-remote (2018-04-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-30 at 244ca5d30a)
 + ls-remote: create '--sort' option

 "git ls-remote" learned an option to allow sorting its output based
 on the refnames being shown.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* js/empty-config-section-fix (2018-04-09) 15 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-25 at 1690df3e5f)
 + git_config_set: reuse empty sections
 + git config --unset: remove empty sections (in the common case)
 + git_config_set: make use of the config parser's event stream
 + git_config_set: do not use a state machine
 + config_set_store: rename some fields for consistency
 + config: avoid using the global variable `store`
 + config: introduce an optional event stream while parsing
 + t1300: `--unset-all` can leave an empty section behind (bug)
 + t1300: add a few more hairy examples of sections becoming empty
 + t1300: remove unreasonable expectation from TODO
 + t1300: avoid relying on a bug
 + config --replace-all: avoid extra line breaks
 + t1300: demonstrate that --replace-all can "invent" newlines
 + t1300: rename it to reflect that `repo-config` was deprecated
 + git_config_set: fix off-by-two

 "git config --unset a.b", when "a.b" is the last variable in an
 otherwise empty section "a", left an empty section "a" behind, and
 worse yet, a subsequent "git config a.c value" did not reuse that
 empty shell and instead created a new one.  These have been
 (partially) corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* nd/warn-more-for-devs (2018-04-16) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-25 at 2978e61414)
 + Makefile: add a DEVOPTS to get all of -Wextra
 + Makefile: add a DEVOPTS to suppress -Werror under DEVELOPER
 + Makefile: detect compiler and enable more warnings in DEVELOPER=1
 + connect.c: mark die_initial_contact() NORETURN

 The build procedure "make DEVELOPER=YesPlease" learned to enable a
 bit more warning options depending on the compiler used to help
 developers more.  There also is "make DEVOPTS=tokens" knob
 available now, for those who want to help fixing warnings we
 usually ignore, for example.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* sb/submodule-move-nested (2018-03-29) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-25 at 86b177433a)
 + submodule: fixup nested submodules after moving the submodule
 + submodule-config: remove submodule_from_cache
 + submodule-config: add repository argument to submodule_from_{name, path}
 + submodule-config: allow submodule_free to handle arbitrary repositories
 + grep: remove "repo" arg from non-supporting funcs
 + submodule.h: drop declaration of connect_work_tree_and_git_dir

 Moving a submodule that itself has submodule in it with "git mv"
 forgot to make necessary adjustment to the nested sub-submodules;
 now the codepath learned to recurse into the submodules.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* tb/config-type (2018-04-19) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-25 at fe69e93c82)
 + builtin/config.c: support `--type=<type>` as preferred alias for `--<type>`
 + builtin/config.c: treat type specifiers singularly
 (this branch is used by tb/config-default.)

 The "git config" command uses separate options e.g. "--int",
 "--bool", etc. to specify what type the caller wants the value to
 be interpreted as.  A new "--type=<typename>" option has been
 introduced, which would make it cleaner to define new types.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* tb/config-default (2018-04-23) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-25 at 59bb6beb2a)
 + builtin/config: introduce `color` type specifier
 + config.c: introduce 'git_config_color' to parse ANSI colors
 + builtin/config: introduce `--default`
 (this branch uses tb/config-type.)

 "git config --get" learned the "--default" option, to help the
 calling script.  Building on top of the tb/config-type topic, the
 "git config" learns "--type=color" type.  Taken together, you can
 do things like "git config --get foo.color --default blue" and get
 the ANSI color sequence for the color given to foo.color variable,
 or "blue" if the variable does not exist.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jh/json-writer (2018-03-28) 1 commit
 - json_writer: new routines to create data in JSON format

 Preparatory code to later add json output for unspecified telemetry
 data.

 We do not add random code that does not have real users to our
 codebase, so let's have it wait until such a real code materializes
 before too long.


* ot/libify-get-ref-atom-value (2018-03-29) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-25 at 056bcaa69c)
 + ref-filter: libify get_ref_atom_value()
 + ref-filter: add return value to parsers
 + ref-filter: change parsing function error handling
 + ref-filter: add return value && strbuf to handlers
 + ref-filter: start adding strbufs with errors
 + ref-filter: add shortcut to work with strbufs

 Code restructuring, in preparation for further work.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/branch-l-0-deprecation (2018-03-26) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-11 at 9b2b0305dd)
 + branch: deprecate "-l" option
 + t: switch "branch -l" to "branch --create-reflog"
 + t3200: unset core.logallrefupdates when testing reflog creation
 (this branch is used by jk/branch-l-1-removal and jk/branch-l-2-reincarnation.)

 The "-l" option in "git branch -l" is an unfortunate short-hand for
 "--create-reflog", but many users, both old and new, somehow expect
 it to be something else, perhaps "--list".  This step deprecates
 the short-hand and warns about the future removal of the it when it
 is used.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* jk/branch-l-1-removal (2018-03-26) 1 commit
 - branch: drop deprecated "-l" option
 (this branch is used by jk/branch-l-2-reincarnation; uses jk/branch-l-0-deprecation.)

 Following the "git branch -l" deprecation, the short-hand is removed.

 Will keep in 'pu'.


* jk/branch-l-2-reincarnation (2018-03-26) 1 commit
 - branch: make "-l" a synonym for "--list"
 (this branch uses jk/branch-l-0-deprecation and jk/branch-l-1-removal.)

 Following the "git branch -l" removal, "-l" is resurrected as a
 short-hand for "--list".

 Will keep in 'pu'.


* dj/runtime-prefix (2018-04-24) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-25 at e7e635a70e)
 + Makefile: quote $INSTLIBDIR when passing it to sed
 + Makefile: remove unused @@PERLLIBDIR@@ substitution variable
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-17 at a69aaa7a22)
 + mingw/msvc: use the new-style RUNTIME_PREFIX helper
 + exec_cmd: provide a new-style RUNTIME_PREFIX helper for Windows
 + exec_cmd: RUNTIME_PREFIX on some POSIX systems
 + Makefile: add Perl runtime prefix support
 + Makefile: generate Perl header from template file
 (this branch is tangled with js/runtime-prefix.)

 A build-time option has been added to allow Git to be told to refer
 to its associated files relative to the main binary, in the same
 way that has been possible on Windows for quite some time, for
 Linux, BSDs and Darwin.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ab/nuke-emacs-contrib (2018-04-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-25 at 9b133d8a65)
 + git{,-blame}.el: remove old bitrotting Emacs code

 The scripts in contrib/emacs/ have outlived their usefulness and
 have been replaced with a stub that errors out and tells the user
 there are replacements.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* nd/pack-objects-pack-struct (2018-04-16) 15 commits
 - ci: exercise the whole test suite with uncommon code in pack-objects
 - pack-objects: reorder members to shrink struct object_entry
 - pack-objects: shrink delta_size field in struct object_entry
 - pack-objects: shrink size field in struct object_entry
 - pack-objects: clarify the use of object_entry::size
 - pack-objects: don't check size when the object is bad
 - pack-objects: shrink z_delta_size field in struct object_entry
 - pack-objects: refer to delta objects by index instead of pointer
 - pack-objects: move in_pack out of struct object_entry
 - pack-objects: move in_pack_pos out of struct object_entry
 - pack-objects: use bitfield for object_entry::depth
 - pack-objects: use bitfield for object_entry::dfs_state
 - pack-objects: turn type and in_pack_type to bitfields
 - pack-objects: a bit of document about struct object_entry
 - read-cache.c: make $GIT_TEST_SPLIT_INDEX boolean

 "git pack-objects" needs to allocate tons of "struct object_entry"
 while doing its work, and shrinking its size helps the performance
 quite a bit.

 What's the doneness of this thing?  The interdiff since previous
 rounds looked reasonable, but I didn't see this round otherwise
 scrutinized by reviewers.  The numbers given in the commit near the
 tip do look impressive, though ;-)


* nd/repack-keep-pack (2018-04-16) 7 commits
 - pack-objects: show some progress when counting kept objects
 - gc --auto: exclude base pack if not enough mem to "repack -ad"
 - gc: handle a corner case in gc.bigPackThreshold
 - gc: add gc.bigPackThreshold config
 - gc: add --keep-largest-pack option
 - repack: add --keep-pack option
 - t7700: have closing quote of a test at the beginning of line

 "git gc" in a large repository takes a lot of time as it considers
 to repack all objects into one pack by default.  The command has
 been taught to pretend as if the largest existing packfile is
 marked with ".keep" so that it is left untouched while objects in
 other packs and loose ones are repacked.

 What's the doneness of this thing?  The interdiff since the earlier
 one looked reasonable, but I didn't see this round otherwise
 scrutinized by reviewers.


* pw/add-p-select (2018-03-16) 3 commits
 - add -p: optimize line selection for short hunks
 - add -p: allow line selection to be inverted
 - add -p: select individual hunk lines

 "git add -p" interactive interface learned to let users choose
 individual added/removed lines to be used in the operation, instead
 of accepting or rejecting a whole hunk.

 Expecting a reroll to reignite the discussion.

* tg/worktree-add-existing-branch (2018-04-30) 4 commits
 - worktree: teach "add" to check out existing branches
 - worktree: factor out dwim_branch function
 - worktree: improve message when creating a new worktree
 - worktree: remove extra members from struct add_opts

 "git worktree add" learned to check out an existing branch.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 - sequencer: avoid using errno clobbered by rollback_lock_file()

 "git rebase" learned "--rebase-merges" to transplant the whole
 topology of commit graph elsewhere.

* js/runtime-prefix-windows (2018-03-27) 5 commits
 . mingw/msvc: use the new-style RUNTIME_PREFIX helper
 . exec_cmd: provide a new-style RUNTIME_PREFIX helper for Windows
 . exec_cmd: RUNTIME_PREFIX on some POSIX systems
 . Makefile: add Perl runtime prefix support
 . Makefile: generate Perl header from template file

 The Windows port was the first that allowed Git to be installed
 anywhere by having its components refer to each other with relative
 pathnames.  The recent dj/runtime-prefix topic extends the idea to
 other platforms, and its approach has been adopted back in the
 Windows port.

 Ejected, as the parent topic dj/runtime-prefix covers Windows now.


* bp/fsexcludes (2018-04-16) 2 commits
 . fsmonitor: switch to use new fsexcludes logic and remove unused untracked cache based logic
 . fsexcludes: add a programmatic way to exclude files from git's working directory traversal logic

 Can we have a few lines summary here, just like we have for other
 topic ;-) I personally take the overlong title of these commits as
 a sign that they can further be simplified and cleaned up by
 splitting, focusing the scope, etc.

 Retracted.
