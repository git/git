What's cooking in git.git (Apr 2019, #04; Mon, 22)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

 names the parse-options API offers, to protect us from an
 abbreviated form of an option that used to be unique within the
 command getting non-unique when a new option that share the same
 prefix is added.

[New Topics]

* es/first-contrib-tutorial (2019-04-21) 1 commit
 - documentation: add lab for first contribution

 A WIP of a new tutorial targetting specifically aspiring git-core
 developers.


* pw/clean-sequencer-state-upon-final-commit (2019-04-17) 2 commits
 - fix cherry-pick/revert status after commit
 - commit/reset: try to clean up sequencer state

 "git chery-pick" (and "revert" that shares the same runtime engine)
 that deals with multiple commits got confused when the final step
 gets stopped with a conflict and the user concluded the sequence
 with "git commit".  Attempt to fix it by cleaning up the state
 files used by these commands in such a situation.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* pw/sequencer-cleanup-with-signoff-x-fix (2019-04-18) 1 commit
 - sequencer: fix cleanup with --signoff and -x
 (this branch is used by dl/merge-cleanup-scissors-fix.)

 "git cherry-pick" run with the "-x" or the "--signoff" option used
 to (and more importantly, ought to) clean up the commit log message
 with the --cleanup=space option by default, but this has been
 broken since late 2017.  This has been fixed.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* dr/ref-filter-push-track-fix (2019-04-18) 1 commit
 - ref-filter: use correct branch for %(push:track)

 %(push:track) token used in the --format option to "git
 for-each-ref" and friends was not showing the right branch, which
 has been fixed.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* cc/aix-has-fileno-as-a-macro (2019-04-19) 1 commit
 - Makefile: use fileno macro work around on AIX

 AIX shared the same build issues with other BSDs around fileno(fp),
 which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/prune-optim (2019-04-19) 1 commit
 - t5304: add a test for pruning with bitmaps

 A follow-up test for an earlier "git prune" improvements.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/untracked-cache-more-fixes (2019-04-19) 3 commits
 - untracked-cache: simplify parsing by dropping "len"
 - untracked-cache: simplify parsing by dropping "next"
 - untracked-cache: be defensive about missing NULs in index
 (this branch uses js/untracked-cache-allocfix.)

 Code clean-up.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jt/submodule-repo-is-with-worktree (2019-04-21) 1 commit
 - worktree: update is_bare heuristics

 The logic to tell if a Git repository has a working tree protects
 "git branch -D" from removing the branch that is currently checked
 out by mistake.  The implementation of this logic was broken for
 repositories with unusual name, which unfortunately is the norm for
 submodules these days.  This has been fixed.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* vk/autoconf-gettext (2019-04-19) 1 commit
 - autoconf: #include <libintl.h> when checking for gettext()

 The autoconf generated configure script failed to use the right
 gettext() implementations from -libintl by ignoring useless stub
 implementations shipped in some C library, which has been
 corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* dl/no-extern-in-func-decl (2019-04-21) 4 commits
 - cocci: prevent extern function declarations
 - *.[ch]: manually align parameter lists
 - *.[ch]: remove extern from function declarations using sed
 - *.[ch]: remove extern from function declarations using spatch

 Mechanically and systematically drop "extern" from function
 declarlation.

 This is the kind of code churn patch that causes heavy conflicts
 with multiple topics in flight, which causes conflicts in slightly
 different shape when it gets merged with them in different order.
 I've queued it moderately early in 'pu' for the night, and I am
 reasonably sure the merge of the topic itself is OK, but I do not
 have much confidence in the resolutions of conflicts with other
 topics later merged to 'pu'.


* js/partial-clone-connectivity-check (2019-04-21) 1 commit
 - clone: do faster object check for partial clones

 During an initial "git clone --depth=..." partial clone, it is
 pointless to spend cycles for a large portion of the connectivity
 check that enumerates and skips promisor objects (which by
 definition is all objects fetched from the other side).  This has
 been optimized out.

 Will merge to 'next'.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* nb/branch-show-other-worktrees-head (2019-03-18) 3 commits
 - branch: add worktree info on verbose output
 - branch: update output to include worktree info
 - ref-filter: add worktreepath atom

 "git branch --list" learned to show branches that are checked out
 in other worktrees connected to the same repository prefixed with
 '+', similar to the way the currently checked out branch is shown
 with '*' in front.

 Getting there...

 WIP for allowing a response to "git fetch" to instruct the bulk of
 the pack contents to be instead taken from elsewhere (aka CDN).

 Waiting for the final version.


* js/add-i-coalesce-after-editing-hunk (2018-08-28) 1 commit
 - add -p: coalesce hunks before testing applicability

 Applicability check after a patch is edited in a "git add -i/p"
 session has been improved.

 Will hold.
 cf. <e5b2900a-0558-d3bf-8ea1-d526b078bbc2@talktalk.net>


* ds/midx-expire-repack (2019-01-27) 10 commits

 - midx: simplify computation of pack name lengths
 - multi-pack-index: prepare for 'expire' subcommand
 - Docs: rearrange subcommands for multi-pack-index
 - repack: refactor pack deletion for future use

 "git multi-pack-index expire/repack" are new subcommands that
 consult midx file and are used to drop unused pack files and
 coalesce small pack files that are still in use.

 Comments?


* js/protocol-advertise-multi (2018-12-28) 1 commit
 - protocol: advertise multiple supported versions

 The transport layer has been updated so that the protocol version
 used can be negotiated between the parties, by the initiator
 listing the protocol versions it is willing to talk, and the other
 side choosing from one of them.

 Expecting a reroll.
 cf. <CANq=j3u-zdb_FvNJGPCmygNMScseav63GhVvBX3NcVS4f7TejA@mail.gmail.com>


* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2018-10-15) 1 commit
 - zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".


* dl/remote-save-to-push (2018-12-11) 1 commit
 - remote: add --save-to-push option to git remote set-url

 "git remote set-url" learned a new option that moves existing value
 of the URL field to pushURL field of the remote before replacing
 the URL field with a new value.

 Anybody who wants to champion this topic?
 I am personally not yet quite convinced if this is worth pursuing.

* hs/send-email-transferencoding-fix (2019-04-10) 1 commit
 - send-email: honor transferencoding config option again

 Since "git send-email" learned to take 'auto' as the value for the
 transfer-encoding, it by mistake stopped honoring the values given
 to the configuration variables sendemail.transferencoding and/or
 sendemail.<ident>.transferencoding.  Attempt to correct this.

 Not quite.
 cf. <xmqq8swi34h5.fsf@gitster-ct.c.googlers.com>


* jk/xmalloc (2019-04-12) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-22 at 1a907289fa)
 + progress: use xmalloc/xcalloc
 + xdiff: use xmalloc/xrealloc
 + xdiff: use git-compat-util
 + test-prio-queue: use xmalloc

 The code is updated to check the result of memory allocation before
 it is used in more places, by using xmalloc and/or xcalloc calls.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* js/untracked-cache-allocfix (2019-04-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-22 at 004a544075)
 + untracked cache: fix off-by-one
 (this branch is used by jk/untracked-cache-more-fixes.)

 An underallocation in the code to read the untracked cache
 extension has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* km/t3000-retitle (2019-04-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-22 at 2d5aa01ca6)
 + t3000 (ls-files -o): widen description to reflect current tests

 A test update.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* bc/send-email-qp-cr (2019-04-14) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-22 at 69398b0ea8)
 + send-email: default to quoted-printable when CR is present

 "git send-email" has been taught to use quoted-printable when the
 payload contains carriage-return.  The use of the mechanism is in
 line with the design originally added the codepath that chooses QP
 when the payload has overly long lines.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/gettext-test-fix (2019-04-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-22 at 7c57deeb04)
 + gettext tests: export the restored GIT_TEST_GETTEXT_POISON

 The GETTEXT_POISON test option has been quite broken ever since it
 was made runtime-tunable, which has been fixed.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/fetch-reachability-error-fix (2019-04-15) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-22 at b4ce8375c0)

 Code clean-up and a fix for "git fetch" by an explicit object name
 (as opposed to fetching refs by name).

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/pack-objects-reports-num-objects-to-trace2 (2019-04-12) 1 commit
 - pack-objects: write objects packed to trace2

 The "git pack-objects" command learned to report the number of
 objects it packed via the trace2 mechanism.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* js/iso8895-test-on-apfs (2019-04-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-22 at c2fadead33)

 + macOS: make sure that gettext is found

 Build with gettext breaks on recent macOS w/ Homebrew when
 /usr/local/bin is not on PATH, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 - docs: exclude documentation for commands that have been excluded
 - check-docs: allow command-list.txt to contain excluded commands
 - help -a: do not list commands that are excluded from the build
 - Makefile: drop the NO_INSTALL variable
 - remote-testgit: move it into the support directory for t5801

 "make check-docs", "git help -a", etc. did not account for cases
 where a particular build may deliberately omit some subcommands,
 which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* nd/submodule-foreach-quiet (2019-04-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-22 at bf982bca7b)
 + submodule foreach: fix "<command> --quiet" not being respected

 "git submodule foreach <command> --quiet" did not pass the option
 down correctly, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* bs/sendemail-tighten-anything-by (2019-04-04) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-22 at 0a0680f234)
 + send-email: don't cc *-by lines with '-' prefix

 The recently added feature to add addresses that are on
 anything-by: trailers in 'git send-email' was found to be way too
 eager and considered nonsense strings as if they can be legitimate
 beginning of *-by: trailer.  This has been tightened.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* dl/warn-tagging-a-tag (2019-04-12) 2 commits
 - tag: advise on nested tags
 - tag: fix formatting

 "git tag" learned to give an advice suggesting it might be a
 mistake when creating an annotated or signed tag that points at
 another tag.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jc/format-patch-delay-message-id (2019-04-05) 1 commit
 - format-patch: move message-id and related headers to the end

 The location "git format-patch --thread" adds the Message-Id:
 header in the series of header fields has been moved down, which
 may help working around a suspected bug in GMail MSA, reported at
 <CAHk-=whP1stFZNAaJiMi5eZ9rj0MRt20Y_yHVczZPH+O01d+sA@mail.gmail.com>

 Waiting for feedback to see if it truly helps.

  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-16 at bdc1465128)
 + revision: use a prio_queue to hold rewritten parents

 Performance fix for "rev-list --parents -- pathspec".

 Will merge to 'master'.


* tb/unexpected (2019-04-10) 7 commits
 - rev-list: detect broken root trees
 - rev-list: let traversal die when --missing is not in use
 - get_commit_tree(): return NULL for broken tree
 - list-objects.c: handle unexpected non-tree entries
 - list-objects.c: handle unexpected non-blob entries
 - t: introduce tests for unexpected object types
 - t: move 'hex2oct' into test-lib-functions.sh

 Code tightening against a "wrong" object appearing where an object
 of a different type is expected, instead of blindly assuming that
 the connection between objects are correctly made.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* en/merge-directory-renames (2019-04-08) 15 commits
 - merge-recursive: switch directory rename detection default
 - merge-recursive: give callers of handle_content_merge() access to contents
 - merge-recursive: track information associated with directory renames
 - t6043: fix copied test description to match its purpose
 - merge-recursive: switch from (oid,mode) pairs to a diff_filespec
 - merge-recursive: cleanup handle_rename_* function signatures
 - merge-recursive: track branch where rename occurred in rename struct
 - merge-recursive: remove ren[12]_other fields from rename_conflict_info
 - merge-recursive: shrink rename_conflict_info
 - merge-recursive: move some struct declarations together
 - merge-recursive: use 'ci' for rename_conflict_info variable name
 - merge-recursive: rename locals 'o' and 'a' to 'obuf' and 'abuf'
 - merge-recursive: rename diff_filespec 'one' to 'o'
 - merge-recursive: rename merge_options argument from 'o' to 'opt'
 - Use 'unsigned short' for mode, like diff_filespec does

 "git merge-recursive" backend recently learned a new heuristics to
 infer file movement based on how other files in the same directory
 moved.  As this is inherently less robust heuristics than the one
 based on the content similarity of the file itself (rather than
 based on what its neighbours are doing), it sometimes gives an
 outcome unexpected by the end users.  This has been toned down to
 leave the renamed paths in higher/conflicted stages in the index so
 that the user can examine and confirm the result.

* sg/blame-in-bare-start-at-head (2019-04-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-22 at 159777c280)
 + blame: default to HEAD in a bare repo when no start commit is given

 "git blame -- path" in a non-bare repository starts blaming from

 Two new commands "git switch" and "git restore" are introduced to
 split "checking out a branch to work on advancing its history" and
 "checking out paths out of the index and/or a tree-ish to work on
 advancing the current history" out of the single "git checkout"
 command.

 The "switch" part seems more or less ready for testing.  Perhaps
 we should split this back into two topics and merge it to 'next'.

 When given a tag that points at a commit-ish, "git replace --graft"

 make sense because the old graft mechanism the feature wants to
 mimick only allowed to replace one commit object with another.

 - add: error appropriately on repository with no commits
 - dir: do not traverse repositories with no commits
 - submodule: refuse to add repository with no commits

 Running "git add" on a repository created inside the current
 repository is an explicit indication that the user wants to add it
 as a submodule, but when the HEAD of the inner repository is on an
 unborn branch, it cannot be added as a submodule.  Worse, the files
 in its working tree can be added as if they are a part of the outer
 repository, which is not what the user wants.  These problems are
 being addressed.

 In recent versions of Git, per-worktree refs are exposed in

 + submodule: teach set-branch subcommand
 + submodule--helper: teach config subcommand --unset
 + git-submodule.txt: "--branch <branch>" option defaults to 'master'

 "git submodule" learns "set-branch" subcommand that allows the
 submodule.*.branch settings to be modified.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* dm/some-stdio-functions-are-macro-on-freebsd (2019-02-01) 1 commit
 - http: cast result to FILE *

 Variants of BSD define fileno(fh) as a macro, breaking a program
 that passes a "void *" to it.

 Expecting a reroll.

 effects (as well as their presence) get ignored.

 Expecting a reroll.

* dl/merge-cleanup-scissors-fix (2019-04-19) 10 commits
 - cherry-pick/revert: add scissors line on merge conflict
 - sequencer.c: save and restore cleanup mode
 - merge: add scissors line on merge conflict

 - commit: extract cleanup_mode functions to sequencer
 - t7502: clean up style
 - t7604: clean up style
 - t3507: clean up style
 - t7600: clean up style
 (this branch uses pw/sequencer-cleanup-with-signoff-x-fix.)

 The list of conflicted paths shown in the editor while concluding a
 conflicted merge was shown above the scissors line when the
 clean-up mode is set to "scissors", even though it was commented
 out just like the list of updated paths and other information to
 help the user explain the merge better.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jn/unknown-index-extensions (2018-11-21) 2 commits
 - index: offer advice for unknown index extensions
 - index: do not warn about unrecognized extensions

 A bit too alarming warning given when unknown index extensions
 exist is getting revamped.

 Expecting a reroll.


* ag/sequencer-reduce-rewriting-todo (2019-03-07) 18 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-10 at 7eab7c7800)
 + rebase--interactive: move transform_todo_file()
 + sequencer: use edit_todo_list() in complete_action()
 + rebase-interactive: rewrite edit_todo_list() to handle the initial edit
 + rebase-interactive: append_todo_help() changes
 + rebase-interactive: use todo_list_write_to_file() in edit_todo_list()
 + sequencer: refactor skip_unnecessary_picks() to work on a todo_list
 + rebase--interactive: move rearrange_squash_in_todo_file()
 + rebase--interactive: move sequencer_add_exec_commands()
 + sequencer: change complete_action() to use the refactored functions
 + sequencer: make sequencer_make_script() write its script to a strbuf
 + sequencer: refactor rearrange_squash() to work on a todo_list
 + sequencer: refactor sequencer_add_exec_commands() to work on a todo_list
 + sequencer: refactor check_todo_list() to work on a todo_list
 + sequencer: introduce todo_list_write_to_file()
 + sequencer: refactor transform_todos() to work on a todo_list
 + sequencer: remove the 'arg' field from todo_item
 + sequencer: make the todo_list structure public
 + sequencer: changes in parse_insn_buffer()
 (this branch is used by pw/rebase-i-internal.)

 The scripted version of "git rebase -i" wrote and rewrote the todo
 list many times during a single step of its operation, and the
 recent C-rewrite made a faithful conversion of the logic to C.  The
 implementation has been updated to carry necessary information
 around in-core to avoid rewriting the same file over and over
 unnecessarily.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 . rev-list: exclude promisor objects at walk time

 "git rev-list --exclude-promisor-objects" learned not to bother
 enumerating all promisor objects, and instead filter these objects
 at walk time for performance.

 Discarded; js/partial-clone-connectivity-check replaces this.
