What's cooking in git.git (Jan 2026, #04)
-----------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and
aren't considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL
to a message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity (of course they can be resubmit when new interests
arise).

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-scm/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

Release tarballs are available at:

* yc/histogram-hunk-shift-fix (2025-12-06) 1 commit
 - xdiff: re-diff shifted change groups when using histogram algorithm

 The final clean-up phase of the diff output could turn the result of
 histogram diff algorithm suboptimal, which has been corrected.

* jk/parse-int (2025-11-30) 5 commits
 - fsck: use parse_unsigned_from_buf() for parsing timestamp
 - cache-tree: use parse_int_from_buf()
 - parse: add functions for parsing from non-string buffers
 - parse: prefer bool to int for boolean returns
 - Merge branch 'jk/asan-bonanza' into jk/parse-int

 Introduce a more robust way to parse a decimal integer stored in a
 piece of memory that is not necessarily terminated with NUL (which
 Asan strict-string-check complains even when use of strtol() is
 safe due to varified existence of whitespace after the digits).

 Expecting a reroll.

* pw/replay-drop-empty (2025-12-18) 2 commits
 - replay: drop commits that become empty
 - Merge branch 'ps/history' into pw/replay-drop-empty
 (this branch uses kh/replay-invalid-onto-advance and ps/history.)

 "git replay" is taught to drop commits that become empty (not the
 ones that are empty in the original).

 On hold, until the base topic gains consensus and stabilizes.

* sp/shallow-time-boundary (2025-11-23) 1 commit
 - shallow: set borders which are all reachable after clone shallow since

 The set of shallow boundary "git clone --shallow-since" leaves
 contained commits that are not on the boundary, which has been
 corrected.

* kn/ref-location (2025-12-01) 2 commits
 - refs: add GIT_REF_URI to specify reference backend and directory

 A mechanism to specify what reference backend to use and store
 references in which directory is introduced, which would likely to
 be useful during ref migration.

 - config: keep bailing on unreadable global files
 - config: read global scope via config_sequence
 - config: test home and xdg files in `list --global`
 - cleanup_path: force forward slashes on Windows

 "git config --list --global", unlike "git config --list", did not
 consult both of the two possible per-user sources of the
 configuration files, i.e. $HOME/.gitconfig and the XDG one, which
 has been corrected.

 Expecting a reroll.

* jc/exclude-with-gitignore (2025-11-04) 1 commit
 - dir.c: do not be fooled by :(exclude) pathspec elements

 "git add ':(exclude)foo.o'" is clearly a request not to add 'foo.o',
 but the command complained about listing an ignored path foo.o on
 the command line, which has been corrected.
