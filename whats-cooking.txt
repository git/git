What's cooking in git.git (Jun 2024, #04; Wed, 12)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and
aren't considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL
to a message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity (of course they can be resubmit when new interests
arise).

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-scm/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/

* jk/am-retry (2024-06-06) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2024-06-10 at 4d62361bc7)
 + test-terminal: drop stdin handling
 + am: add explicit "--retry" option

 "git am" has a safety feature to prevent it from starting a new
 session when there already is a session going.  It reliably
 triggers when a mbox is given on the command line, but it has to
 rely on the tty-ness of the standard input.  Add an explicit way to
 opt out of this safety with a command line option.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 Allow a server S that is a lazy clone of another repository X to
 respond to a request by C that is a lazy clone of S in a way that
 it omits objects it itself does not have (and has to be lazily
 fetched from X).

 I would say this is a terribly irresponsive design, especially
 there is no negociation for S to learn if the objects it is going
 to omit is obtainable by C from elsewhere.

* ts/archive-prefix-with-add-virtual-file (2024-05-17) 1 commit
 - archive: make --add-virtual-file honor --prefix

 The "--add-virtual-file" option of "git archive", added primarily
 to help "git diagnose", has always ignored the "--prefix", but
 been documented to honor it.

 Iffy if updating the implementation is the best approach.

 - rebase -i: improve error message when picking merge
 - rebase -i: pass struct replay_opts to parse_insn_line()

 When the user adds to "git rebase -i" instruction to "pick" a merge
 commit, the error experience is not pleasant.  Such an error is now
 caught earlier in the process that parses the todo list.

 Expecting a reroll.
