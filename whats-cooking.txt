What's cooking in git.git (Feb 2016, #02; Fri, 5)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches of the
repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* da/user-useconfigonly (2016-02-05) 2 commits
 - ident: add user.useConfigOnly boolean for when ident shouldn't be guessed
 - fmt_ident: refactor strictness checks

 The "user.useConfigOnly" configuration variable can be used to
 force the user to always set user.email & user.name configuration
 variables, serving as a reminder for those who work on multiple
 projects and do not want to put these in their $HOME/.gitconfig.

[Graduated to "master"]

* dg/subtree-test (2016-01-19) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-01-26 at 81f1356)
 + contrib/subtree: Make testing easier


* dt/unpack-compare-entry-optim (2016-01-22) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-01-26 at 110e053)
 + unpack-trees: fix accidentally quadratic behavior
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-01-20 at 180dccf)
 + do_compare_entry: use already-computed path

 "git checkout $branch" (and other operations that share the same
 underlying machinery) has been optimized.


* dw/subtree-split-do-not-drop-merge (2016-01-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-01-26 at 3cfefef)
 + contrib/subtree: fix "subtree split" skipped-merge bug

 The "split" subcommand of "git subtree" (in contrib/) incorrectly
 skipped merges when it shouldn't, which was corrected.


* jc/peace-with-crlf (2016-01-15) 12 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-01-26 at 08724bc)
 + test-sha1-array: read command stream with strbuf_getline()
 + grep: read -f file with strbuf_getline()
 + send-pack: read list of refs with strbuf_getline()
 + column: read lines with strbuf_getline()
 + cat-file: read batch stream with strbuf_getline()
 + transport-helper: read helper response with strbuf_getline()
 + clone/sha1_file: read info/alternates with strbuf_getline()
 + remote.c: read $GIT_DIR/remotes/* with strbuf_getline()
 + ident.c: read /etc/mailname with strbuf_getline()
 + rev-parse: read parseopt spec with strbuf_getline()
 + revision: read --stdin with strbuf_getline()
 + hash-object: read --stdin-paths with strbuf_getline()

 Many commands that read files that are expected to contain text
 that is generated (or can be edited) by the end user to control
 their behaviour (e.g. "git grep -f <filename>") have been updated
 to be more tolerant to lines that are terminated with CRLF (they
 used to treat such a line to contain payload that ends with CR,
 which is usually not what the users expect).


* jk/completion-rebase (2016-01-25) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-01-26 at def3e0b)
 + completion: add missing git-rebase options


* jk/notes-merge-from-anywhere (2016-01-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-01-26 at c60ac66)
 + notes: allow merging from arbitrary references

 "git notes merge" used to limit the source of the merged notes tree
 to somewhere under refs/notes/ hierarchy, which was too limiting
 when inventing a workflow to exchange notes with remote
 repositories using remote-tracking notes trees (located in e.g.
 refs/remote-notes/ or somesuch).


* jk/ref-cache-non-repository-optim (2016-01-25) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-01-26 at 09057bc)
 + resolve_gitlink_ref: ignore non-repository paths
 + clean: make is_git_repository a public function

 The underlying machinery used by "ls-files -o" and other commands
 have been taught not to create empty submodule ref cache for a
 directory that is not a submodule.  This removes a ton of wasted
 CPU cycles.


* js/dirname-basename (2016-01-25) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-01-26 at b16b2b8)
 + mingw: avoid linking to the C library's isalpha()
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-01-20 at d198512)
 + t0060: loosen overly strict expectations
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-01-12 at c3c970a)
 + t0060: verify that basename() and dirname() work as expected
 + compat/basename.c: provide a dirname() compatibility function
 + compat/basename: make basename() conform to POSIX
 + Refactor skipping DOS drive prefixes

 dirname() emulation has been added, as Msys2 lacks it.


* kf/http-proxy-auth-methods (2016-01-26) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-02-01 at b0956b2)
 + http: use credential API to handle proxy authentication
 + http: allow selection of proxy authentication method

 New http.proxyAuthMethod configuration variable can be used to
 specify what authentication method to use, as a way to work around
 proxies that do not give error response expected by libcurl when
 CURLAUTH_ANY is used.  Also, the codepath for proxy authentication
 has been taught to use credential API to store the authentication
 material in user's keyrings.


* ls/travis-prove-order (2016-01-26) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-01-26 at d8e2a4a)
 + travis-ci: explicity use container-based infrastructure
 + travis-ci: run previously failed tests first, then slowest to fastest

 Automated tests in Travis CI environment has been optimized by
 persisting runtime statistics of previous "prove" run, executing
 tests that take longer before other ones; this reduces the total
 wallclock time.


* lv/add-doc-working-tree (2016-01-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-01-26 at c5b1ab1)
 + git-add doc: do not say working directory when you mean working tree


* mk/asciidoctor-bq-workaround (2016-01-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-01-26 at 19a742a)
 + Documentation: remove unnecessary backslashes


* nd/diff-with-path-params (2016-01-21) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-01-26 at b29a363)
 + diff: make -O and --output work in subdirectory
 + diff-no-index: do not take a redundant prefix argument

 A few options of "git diff" did not work well when the command was
 run from a subdirectory.


* pw/completion-show-branch (2016-01-25) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-01-26 at d0d7735)
 + completion: complete show-branch "--date-order"


* pw/completion-stash (2016-01-26) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-01-26 at e41153c)
 + completion: update completion arguments for stash


* tb/complete-word-diff-regex (2016-01-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-01-26 at a5beecc)
 + completion: complete "diff --word-diff-regex="


* tb/ls-files-eol (2016-01-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-01-26 at bc9246f)
 + ls-files: add eol diagnostics

 "git ls-files" learned a new "--eol" option to help diagnose
 end-of-line problems.


* tg/ls-remote-symref (2016-01-19) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-01-26 at e466ee2)
 + ls-remote: add support for showing symrefs
 + ls-remote: use parse-options api
 + ls-remote: fix synopsis
 + ls-remote: document --refs option
 + ls-remote: document --quiet option

 "ls-remote" learned an option to show which branch the remote
 repository advertises as its primary by pointing its HEAD at.

* ec/annotate-deleted (2015-11-20) 1 commit
 - annotate: skip checking working tree if a revision is provided

 Usability fix for annotate-specific "<file> <rev>" syntax with deleted
 files.

 Waiting for review.


* dg/subtree-rebase-test (2016-01-19) 1 commit
 - contrib/subtree: Add a test for subtree rebase that loses commits

 Reviewed up to v5.
 Will be rerolled.
 ($gmane/284426)


* dk/gc-more-wo-pack (2016-01-13) 4 commits
 - gc: clean garbage .bitmap files from pack dir
 - t5304: ensure non-garbage files are not deleted
 - t5304: test .bitmap garbage files
 - prepare_packed_git(): find more garbage

 Follow-on to dk/gc-idx-wo-pack topic, to clean up stale
 .bitmap and .keep files.

 Waiting for a reroll.
 ($gmane/284368).


* mg/httpd-tests-update-for-apache-2.4 (2015-04-08) 2 commits
 - t/lib-git-svn: check same httpd module dirs as lib-httpd
 - t/lib-httpd: load mod_unixd

 This is the first two commits in a three-patch series $gmane/266962

 Becoming tired of waiting for a reroll.
 with updated log message ($gmane/268061).
 Will discard.


* jc/diff-b-m (2015-02-23) 5 commits
 . WIPWIP
 . WIP: diff-b-m
 - diffcore-rename: allow easier debugging
 - diffcore-rename.c: add locate_rename_src()
 - diffcore-break: allow debugging

 "git diff -B -M" produced incorrect patch when the postimage of a
 completely rewritten file is similar to the preimage of a removed
 file; such a resulting file must not be expressed as a rename from
 other place.

 The fix in this patch is broken, unfortunately.
 Will discard.

* aw/push-force-with-lease-reporting (2016-02-01) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-02-03 at facd28f)
 + push: fix ref status reporting for --force-with-lease

 "git push --force-with-lease" has been taught to report if the push
 needed to force (or fast-forwarded).

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ew/connect-verbose (2016-01-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-02-03 at ceac37e)
 + pass transport verbosity down to git_connect

 There were a few "now I am doing this thing" progress messages in
 the TCP connection code that can be triggered by setting a verbose
 option internally in the code, but "git fetch -v" and friends never
 passed the verbose option down to that codepath.

 There was a brief discussion about the impact on the end-user
 experience by not limiting this to "fetch -v -v", but I think the
 conclusion is that this is OK to enable with a single "-v" as it is
 not too noisy.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ls/clean-smudge-override-in-config (2016-01-29) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-02-03 at 5962354)
 + convert: treat an empty string for clean/smudge filters as "cat"

 Clean/smudge filters defined in a configuration file of lower
 precedence can now be overridden to be a pass-through no-op by
 setting the variable to an empty string.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ah/stripspace-optstring (2016-01-29) 1 commit
 - stripspace: call U+0020 a "space" instead of a "blank"

 Comments?


* dw/mergetool-vim-window-shuffle (2016-01-29) 1 commit
 - mergetool: reorder vim/gvim buffers in three-way diffs

 Comments from real vim/gvim users?


* jk/drop-rsync-transport (2016-02-01) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-02-03 at 08be402)
 + transport: drop support for git-over-rsync

 It turns out "git clone" over rsync transport has been broken when
 the source repository has packed references for a long time, and
 nobody noticed nor complained about it.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/options-cleanup (2016-02-01) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-02-03 at a78d89d)
 + apply, ls-files: simplify "-z" parsing
 + checkout-index: disallow "--no-stage" option
 + checkout-index: handle "--no-index" option
 + checkout-index: handle "--no-prefix" option
 + checkout-index: simplify "-z" option parsing
 + give "nbuf" strbuf a more meaningful name

 Various clean-ups to the command line option parsing.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* dv/http-try-negotiate-at-least-once (2016-02-02) 1 commit
 - remote-curl: don't fall back to Basic auth if we haven't tried Negotiate

 Needs at least an update to the log message.
 ($gmane/285314)


* js/test-lib-windows-emulated-yes (2016-02-02) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-02-03 at bf6b42c)
 + test-lib: limit the output of the yes utility

 The emulated "yes" command used in our test scripts has been
 tweaked not to spend too much time generating unnecessary output
 that is not used, to help those who test on Windows where it would
 not stop until it fills the pipe buffer due to lack of SIGPIPE.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* sb/submodule-parallel-update (2016-01-12) 8 commits
 - clone: allow an explicit argument for parallel submodule clones
 - submodule update: expose parallelism to the user
 - git submodule update: have a dedicated helper for cloning
 - fetching submodules: respect `submodule.fetchJobs` config option
 - submodule-config: introduce parse_generic_submodule_config
 - submodule-config: remove name_and_item_from_var
 - submodule-config: drop check against NULL
 - submodule-config: keep update strategy around
 (this branch is used by dt/refs-backend-lmdb and sb/submodule-init.)

 Builds on top of the "fetch --recurse-submodules" work to introduce
 parallel downloading into multiple submodules for "submodule update".

 Needs review.
 ($gmane/285285)


* dt/refs-backend-lmdb (2016-02-02) 21 commits
 . refs: tests for lmdb backend
 . refs: add LMDB refs backend
 . svn: learn ref-storage argument
 . refs: allow ref backend to be set for clone
 . refs: check submodules ref storage config
 . init: allow alternate backends to be set for new repos

 . refs: add do_for_each_per_worktree_ref
 . refs: add methods for the ref iterators
 . refs: add methods for misc ref operations
 . refs: add a backend method structure with transaction functions
 . Merge branch 'sb/submodule-parallel-update' into dt/refs-backend-lmdb
 (this branch uses sb/submodule-parallel-update; is tangled with sb/submodule-init.)

 Building on top of a few refs-backend preparatory series, LMDB
 based refs backend has been plugged into the system.

 This can now be reviewed and polished as it no longer depends on
 too many topics in flight.  I haven't picked the latest one posted
 apart to queue it as a topic properly, as the patches sent to the
 list were done on top of some version of 'pu'.


* js/mingw-tests (2016-01-28) 20 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-02-03 at ace7624)
 + mingw: do not bother to test funny file names
 + mingw: skip a test in t9130 that cannot pass on Windows
 + mingw: handle the missing POSIXPERM prereq in t9124
 + mingw: avoid illegal filename in t9118

 + mingw: factor out Windows specific environment setup
 + Git.pm: stop assuming that absolute paths start with a slash
 + mingw: do not trust MSYS2's MinGW gettext.sh
 + mingw: let's use gettext with MSYS2

 Test scripts have been updated to remove assumptions that are not
 portable between Git for POSIX and Git for Windows, or to skip ones
 with expectations that are not satisfiable on Git for Windows.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* js/xmerge-marker-eol (2016-01-27) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-02-01 at 05d91a4)
 + merge-file: ensure that conflict sections match eol style
 + merge-file: let conflict markers match end-of-line style of the context

 The low-level merge machinery has been taught to use CRLF line
 termination when inserting conflict markers to merged contents that
 are themselves CRLF line-terminated.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* nd/clear-gitenv-upon-use-of-alias (2016-02-02) 4 commits
 - restore_env(): free the saved environment variable once we are done
 - git: simplify environment save/restore logic
 - git: protect against unbalanced calls to {save,restore}_env()
 - git: remove an early return from save_env_before_alias()

 The automatic typo correction applied to an alias was broken
 with a recent change already in 'master'.

 Needs review.


* nd/do-not-move-worktree-manually (2016-01-22) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-01-26 at c539221)
 + worktree: stop supporting moving worktrees manually
 + worktree.c: fix indentation

 "git worktree" had a broken code that attempted to auto-fix
 possible inconsistency that results from end-users moving a
 worktree to different places without telling Git (the original
 repository needs to maintain backpointers to its worktrees, but
 "mv" run by end-users who are not familiar with that fact will
 obviously not adjust them), which actually made things worse
 when triggered.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* sb/submodule-init (2016-01-28) 2 commits
 - submodule: port init from shell to C
 - submodule: port resolve_relative_url from shell to C
 (this branch uses sb/submodule-parallel-update; is tangled with dt/refs-backend-lmdb.)

 Major part of "git submodule init" has been ported to C.

 Will have to wait for 'sb/submodule-parallel-update'.


* wp/sha1-name-negative-match (2016-02-01) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-02-03 at 89fa5ef)
 + object name: introduce '^{/!-<negative pattern>}' notation
 + test for '!' handling in rev-parse's named commits

 A new "<branch>^{/!-<pattern>}" notation can be used to name a
 commit that is reachable from <branch> that does not match the
 given <pattern>.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* cc/untracked (2016-01-27) 11 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-02-01 at 8203631)
 + t7063: add tests for core.untrackedCache
 + test-dump-untracked-cache: don't modify the untracked cache
 + config: add core.untrackedCache
 + dir: simplify untracked cache "ident" field
 + dir: add remove_untracked_cache()
 + dir: add {new,add}_untracked_cache()
 + update-index: move 'uc' var declaration
 + update-index: add untracked cache notifications
 + update-index: add --test-untracked-cache
 + update-index: use enum for untracked cache options
 + dir: free untracked cache when removing it

 Update the untracked cache subsystem and change its primary UI from
 "git update-index" to "git config".

 Will merge to 'master'.


* kn/ref-filter-atom-parsing (2016-02-02) 12 commits
 - ref-filter: introduce objectname_atom_parser()
 - ref-filter: introduce contents_atom_parser()
 - ref-filter: introduce remote_ref_atom_parser()
 - ref-filter: align: introduce long-form syntax
 - ref-filter: introduce align_atom_parser()
 - ref-filter: introduce parse_align_position()
 - ref-filter: introduce color_atom_parser()
 - ref-filter: introduce parsing functions for each valid atom
 - ref-filter: introduce struct used_atom
 - ref-filter: bump 'used_atom' and related code to the top
 - ref-filter: use strbuf_split_str_omit_term()
 - strbuf: introduce strbuf_split_str_omit_term()

 Refactoring of ref-filter's format-parsing code, in preparation
 for "branch --format" and friends.

 ($gmane/285158)


* js/am-3-merge-recursive-direct (2015-10-12) 2 commits
 - am: make a direct call to merge_recursive
 - merge_recursive_options: introduce the "gently" flag

 The merge_recursive_generic() function has been made a bit safer to
 call from inside a process.  "git am -3" was taught to make a direct
 call to the function when falling back to three-way merge.

 Being able to make a direct call would be good in general, but as a
 performance thing, the change needs to be backed up by numbers.

 Needs review.

 I haven't gone through the "gently" change with fine toothed comb;
 I can see that the change avoids calling die(), but I haven't made
 sure that the program states (e.g. what's in the in-core index) are
 adjusted sensibly when it returns to the caller instead of dying,
 or the codepaths that used to die() are free of resource leaks.
 The original code certainly did not care the program states at the
 point of dying exactly because it knew it is going to exit, but now
 they have to care, and they need to be audited.


* ad/cygwin-wants-rename (2015-08-07) 1 commit
 - config.mak.uname: Cygwin needs OBJECT_CREATION_USES_RENAMES

 Will hold.
 ($gmane/275680).


* jc/rerere-multi (2016-01-21) 7 commits
 - rerere: do use multiple variants
 - t4200: rerere a merge with two identical conflicts
 - rerere: allow multiple variants to exist
 - rerere: delay the recording of preimage
 - rerere: handle leftover rr-cache/$ID directory and postimage files
 - rerere: scan $GIT_DIR/rr-cache/$ID when instantiating a rerere_id
 - rerere: split conflict ID further

 "git rerere" can encounter two or more files with the same conflict
 signature that have to be resolved in different ways, but there was
 no way to record these separate resolutions.

 Needs further work on forget/gc.


* jc/merge-drop-old-syntax (2015-04-29) 1 commit
 - merge: drop 'git merge <message> HEAD <commit>' syntax

 Stop supporting "git merge <message> HEAD <commit>" syntax that has
 been deprecated since October 2007.  It has been reported that
 git-gui still uses the deprecated syntax, which needs to be fixed
 before this final step can proceed.
