What's cooking in git.git (Oct 2018, #02; Sat, 13)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

Quite a lot of topics have been merged to 'next'.  Let's see how
well they fare.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* ab/gc-doc-update (2018-10-11) 1 commit
 - gc doc: mention the commit-graph in the intro

 The documentation of "git gc" has been updated to mention that it
 is no longer limited to "pruning away crufts" but also updates
 ancillary files like commit-graph as a part of repository
 optimization.

 Waiting for reactions.

 The author seems to feel that this might be controversial.


* du/branch-show-current (2018-10-12) 2 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - branch: introduce --show-current display option

 "git branch" learned a new subcommand "--show-current".


* du/rev-parse-is-plumbing (2018-10-11) 1 commit
 - doc: move git-rev-parse from porcelain to plumbing

 Doc update.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* mm/doc-no-dashed-git (2018-10-11) 1 commit
 - doc: fix a typo and clarify a sentence

 Doc update.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ot/ref-filter-plug-leaks (2018-10-11) 3 commits
 . ref-filter: free item->value and item->value->s
 . ls-remote: release memory instead of UNLEAK
 . ref-filter: free memory from used_atom

 Plugging a handful of memory leaks in the ref-filter codepath.

 Seems to break t6300 standalone and when merged to 'pu'.


* rv/send-email-cc-misc-by (2018-10-11) 3 commits
 - send-email: also pick up cc addresses from -by trailers
 - send-email: only consider lines containing @ or <> for automatic Cc'ing
 - Documentation/git-send-email.txt: style fixes

 "git send-email" learned to grab address-looking string on any
 trailer whose name ends with "-by"; --suppress-cc=misc-by on the
 command line, or setting sendemail.suppresscc configuration
 variable to "misc-by", can be used to disable this behaviour.

 This is a backward-incompatible change that may surprise existing
 users.


* du/cherry-is-plumbing (2018-10-12) 1 commit
 - doc: move git-cherry to plumbing

 Doc update to mark "git cherry" as a plumbing command.


* du/get-tar-commit-id-is-plumbing (2018-10-12) 1 commit
 - doc: move git-get-tar-commit-id to plumbing

 Doc update to mark "git get-tar-commit-id" as a plumbing command.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* lm/range-diff-submodule-fix (2018-10-12) 1 commit
 - range-diff: allow to diff files regardless submodule

 "git range-diff" did not work well when the compared ranges had
 changes in submodules and the "--submodule=log" was used.

 Will merge to 'next'.

* lt/date-human (2018-07-09) 1 commit
 - Add 'human' date format

 A new date format "--date=human" that morphs its output depending
 on how far the time is from the current time has been introduced.
 "--date=auto" can be used to use this new format when the output is
 goint to the pager or to the terminal and otherwise the default
 format.

* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2018-10-12) 1 commit
 - zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".


* ds/reachable-final-cleanup (2018-09-25) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-12 at 32c6d5f55a)
 + commit-reach: cleanups in can_all_from_reach...

 Code already in 'master' is further cleaned-up by this patch.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* dz/credential-doc-url-matching-rules (2018-09-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-12 at 4547952530)
 + doc: clarify gitcredentials path component matching

 Doc update.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* en/status-multiple-renames-to-the-same-target-fix (2018-09-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-12 at 4976fc61a0)
 + commit: fix erroneous BUG, 'multiple renames on the same target? how?'

 The code in "git status" sometimes hit an assertion failure.  This
 was caused by a structure that was reused without cleaning the data
 used for the first run, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/how-to-document-api (2018-09-29) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-12 at 7c9bd82285)
 + CodingGuidelines: document the API in *.h files

 Doc update.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/rebase-in-c-5-test-typofix (2018-10-11) 1 commit
 - rebase: fix typoes in error messages
 (this branch uses pk/rebase-in-c, pk/rebase-in-c-2-basic, pk/rebase-in-c-3-acts, pk/rebase-in-c-4-opts and pk/rebase-in-c-5-test; is tangled with js/rebase-in-c-5.5-work-with-rebase-i-in-c and pk/rebase-in-c-6-final.)

 Typofix.

 Will merge to 'next' together with pk/rebase-i-in-c-6-final.


* jc/war-on-string-list (2018-09-28) 1 commit
 - fetch: replace string-list used as a look-up table with a hashmap

 Replace two string-list instances used as look-up tables in "git
 fetch" with a pair of hashmaps.  WIP as there is another such use
 of string-list nearby that should be converted at the same time.


* jk/check-everything-connected-is-long-gone (2018-09-25) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-12 at 4ce30c9a30)
 + receive-pack: update comment with check_everything_connected

 Comment fix.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/oideq-hasheq-cleanup (2018-10-04) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-12 at 7c9b5681da)
 + more oideq/hasheq conversions

 Code clean-up.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* js/mingw-wants-vista-or-above (2018-10-04) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-12 at 3a174c3d43)
 + mingw: bump the minimum Windows version to Vista
 + mingw: set _WIN32_WINNT explicitly for Git for Windows
 + compat/poll: prepare for targeting Windows Vista

 The minimum version of Windows supported by Windows port fo Git is
 now set to Vista.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* js/rebase-i-break (2018-10-12) 2 commits
 - rebase -i: introduce the 'break' command
 - rebase -i: clarify what happens on a failed `exec`
 (this branch uses ag/rebase-i-in-c; is tangled with ag/sequencer-reduce-rewriting-todo, js/rebase-in-c-5.5-work-with-rebase-i-in-c and pk/rebase-in-c-6-final.)

 "git rebase -i" learned a new insn, 'break', that the user can
 insert in the to-do list.  Upon hitting it, the command returns
 control back to the user.

 Will merge to 'next' after 'pk/rebase-in-c-6-final'.


* js/remote-archive-v2 (2018-09-28) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-12 at 5f34377f60)
 + archive: allow archive over HTTP(S) with proto v2
 + archive: implement protocol v2 archive command
 + archive: use packet_reader for communications
 + archive: follow test standards around assertions

 The original implementation of "git archive --remote" more or less
 bypassed the transport layer and did not work over http(s).  The
 version 2 of the protocol is defined to allow going over http(s) as
 well as Git native transport.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jt/non-blob-lazy-fetch (2018-10-04) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-12 at 7466c6bd7d)
 + fetch-pack: exclude blobs when lazy-fetching trees
 + fetch-pack: avoid object flags if no_dependents

 A partial clone that is configured to lazily fetch missing objects
 will on-demand issue a "git fetch" request to the originating
 repository to fill not-yet-obtained objects.  The request has been
 optimized for requesting a tree object (and not the leaf blob
 objects contained in it) by telling the originating repository that
 no blobs are needed.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ma/commit-graph-docs (2018-09-27) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-12 at eafaf79b5a)
 + Doc: refer to the "commit-graph file" with dash
 + git-commit-graph.txt: refer to "*commit*-graph file"
 + git-commit-graph.txt: typeset more in monospace
 + git-commit-graph.txt: fix bullet lists

 Doc update.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 Doc update.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ma/t1400-undebug-test (2018-09-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-12 at d736f83435)
 + t1400: drop debug `echo` to actually execute `test`

 Test fix.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ma/t7005-bash-workaround (2018-09-28) 1 commit
 - t7005-editor: quote filename to fix whitespace-issue

 Test fix.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* nd/help-commands-verbose-by-default (2018-10-03) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-12 at 32de8f53e0)
 + help -a: improve and make --verbose default

 "git help -a" and "git help -av" give different pieces of
 information, and generally the "verbose" version is more friendly
 to the new users.  "git help -a" by default now uses the more
 verbose output (with "--no-verbose", you can go back to the
 original).  Also "git help -av" now lists aliases and external
 commands, which it did not used to.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* nd/packobjectshook-doc-fix (2018-09-29) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-12 at 85d75f5219)
 + config.txt: correct the note about uploadpack.packObjectsHook

 Doc update.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* pw/diff-color-moved-ws-fix (2018-10-04) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-12 at 73badc83fe)
 + diff --color-moved: fix a memory leak
 + diff --color-moved-ws: fix another memory leak
 + diff --color-moved-ws: fix a memory leak
 + diff --color-moved-ws: fix out of bounds string access
 + diff --color-moved-ws: fix double free crash

 Various fixes to "diff --color-moved-ws".

 Will merge to 'master'.


* rs/grep-no-recursive (2018-10-03) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-12 at 1499dc98ba)
 + grep: add -r/--[no-]recursive

 Unlike "grep", "git grep" by default recurses to the whole tree.
 The command learned "git grep --recursive" option, so that "git
 grep --no-recursive" can serve as a synonym to setting the
 max-depth to 0.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* rs/oidset-on-khash (2018-10-04) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-12 at 8bb0152b3f)
 + oidset: uninline oidset_init()
 + oidset: use khash
 + khash: factor out kh_release_*
 + fetch-pack: load tip_oids eagerly iff needed
 + fetch-pack: factor out is_unmatched_ref()

 The oidset API was built on top of the oidmap API which in turn is
 on the hashmap API.  Replace the implementation to build on top of
 the khash API and gain performance.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* rs/sequencer-oidset-insert-avoids-dups (2018-10-03) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-12 at b294394711)
 + sequencer: use return value of oidset_insert()

 Code clean-up.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* rt/rebase-typofix (2018-09-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-12 at 58691d20df)
 + git-rebase.sh: fix typos in error messages

 Typofix.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* rv/alias-help (2018-10-11) 3 commits
 - git-help.txt: document "git help cmd" vs "git cmd --help" for aliases
 - git.c: handle_alias: prepend alias info when first argument is -h
 - help: redirect to aliased commands for "git cmd --help"

 "git cmd --help" when "cmd" is aliased used to only say "cmd is
 aliased to ...".  Now it shows that to the standard error stream
 and runs "git $cmd --help" where $cmd is the first word of the
 alias expansion.  This could be misleading for those who alias a
 command with options (e.g. with "[alias] cpn = cherry-pick -n",
 "git cpn --help" would show the manual of "cherry-pick", and the
 reader would not be told to pay close attention to the part that
 describes the "--no-commit" option until closing the pager that
 showed the contents of the manual, if the pager is configured to
 restore the original screen, or would not be told at all, if the
 pager simply makes the message on the standard error scroll away.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sb/strbuf-h-update (2018-09-29) 1 commit
 - strbuf.h: format according to coding guidelines

 Code clean-up to serve as a BCP example.

 What's the status of this one after the discussion thread stopped here?
 cf. <CAGZ79kbV6QjsFKcD2uG_P9j1AvzSNQSi-_jXGQ9w0YU9fjhEGg@mail.gmail.com>


* sg/split-index-racefix (2018-10-12) 7 commits
 - split-index: BUG() when cache entry refers to non-existing shared entry
 - split-index: smudge and add racily clean cache entries to split index
 - split-index: don't compare cached data of entries already marked for split index
 - split-index: count the number of deleted entries
 - t1700-split-index: date back files to avoid racy situations
 - split-index: add tests to demonstrate the racy split index problem
 - t1700-split-index: document why FSMONITOR is disabled in this test script

 The codepath to support the experimental split-index mode had
 remaining "racily clean" issues fixed.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sm/show-superproject-while-conflicted (2018-09-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-12 at 0334353131)
 + rev-parse: --show-superproject-working-tree should work during a merge

 A corner-case bugfix.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ag/sequencer-reduce-rewriting-todo (2018-10-09) 16 commits
 - rebase--interactive: move transform_todo_file() to rebase--interactive.c
 - sequencer: fix a call to error() in transform_todo_file()
 - sequencer: use edit_todo_list() in complete_action()
 - rebase-interactive: rewrite edit_todo_list() to handle the initial edit
 - rebase-interactive: append_todo_help() changes
 - rebase-interactive: use todo_list_transform() in edit_todo_list()
 - sequencer: refactor skip_unnecessary_picks() to work on a todo_list
 - sequencer: change complete_action() to use the refactored functions
 - sequencer: make sequencer_make_script() write its script to a strbuf
 - sequencer: refactor transform_todos() to work on a todo_list
 - sequencer: refactor rearrange_squash() to work on a todo_list
 - sequencer: refactor sequencer_add_exec_commands() to work on a todo_list
 - sequencer: refactor check_todo_list() to work on a todo_list
 - sequencer: make the todo_list structure public
 - sequencer: clear the number of items of a todo_list before parsing
 - Merge branch 'ag/rebase-i-in-c' into ag/sequencer-reduce-rewriting-todo
 (this branch uses ag/rebase-i-in-c; is tangled with js/rebase-i-break, js/rebase-in-c-5.5-work-with-rebase-i-in-c and pk/rebase-in-c-6-final.)

 The scripted version of "git rebase -i" wrote and rewrote the todo
 list many times during a single step of its operation, and the
 recent C-rewrite made a faithful conversion of the logic to C.  The
 implementation has been updated to carry necessary information
 around in-core to avoid rewriting the same file over and over
 unnecessarily.

 Will hold, waiting for the "rebase-in-c" and "rebase-i-in-c" topics.


* bc/editorconfig (2018-10-09) 2 commits
 - editorconfig: indicate settings should be kept in sync
 - editorconfig: provide editor settings for Git developers

 To help developers, an EditorConfig file that attempts to follow
 the project convention has been added.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* bc/hash-transition-part-15 (2018-10-09) 14 commits
 - rerere: convert to use the_hash_algo
 - submodule: make zero-oid comparison hash function agnostic
 - apply: rename new_sha1_prefix and old_sha1_prefix
 - apply: replace hard-coded constants
 - tag: express constant in terms of the_hash_algo
 - transport: use parse_oid_hex instead of a constant
 - upload-pack: express constants in terms of the_hash_algo
 - refs/packed-backend: express constants using the_hash_algo
 - packfile: express constants in terms of the_hash_algo
 - pack-revindex: express constants in terms of the_hash_algo
 - builtin/fetch-pack: remove constants with parse_oid_hex
 - builtin/mktree: remove hard-coded constant
 - builtin/repack: replace hard-coded constant
 - pack-bitmap-write: use GIT_MAX_RAWSZ for allocation

 More codepaths are moving away from hardcoded hash sizes.


* ch/subtree-build (2018-10-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-12 at 4ed9ff6300)
 + subtree: add build targets 'man' and 'html'

 Build update for "git subtree" (in contrib/) documentation pages.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ds/commit-graph-leakfix (2018-10-07) 3 commits

 + commit-graph: reduce initial oid allocation
 + builtin/commit-graph.c: UNLEAK variables
 + commit-graph: clean up leaked memory during write
 (this branch uses ab/commit-graph-progress.)

 Code clean-up.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ds/test-multi-pack-index (2018-10-09) 3 commits
 - multi-pack-index: define GIT_TEST_MULTI_PACK_INDEX
 - midx: close multi-pack-index on repack

 Tests for the recently introduced multi-pack index machinery.

 Expecting a reroll.

* js/fuzzer (2018-10-10) 2 commits
 - fuzz: add fuzz testing for packfile indices
 - fuzz: add basic fuzz testing target

 An experiment to fuzz test a few areas, hopefully we can gain more
 coverage to various areas.


* jt/avoid-ls-refs (2018-10-07) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-12 at 5775aabbc1)
 + fetch: do not list refs if fetching only hashes
 + transport: list refs before fetch if necessary
 + transport: do not list refs if possible
 + transport: allow skipping of ref listing

 Over some transports, fetching objects with an exact commit object
 name can be done without first seeing the ref advertisements.  The
 code has been optimized to exploit this.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jt/cache-tree-allow-missing-object-in-partial-clone (2018-10-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-12 at 152ad8e336)
 + cache-tree: skip some blob checks in partial clone

 In a partial clone that will lazily be hydrated from the
 originating repository, we generally want to avoid "does this
 object exist (locally)?" on objects that we deliberately omitted
 when we created the clone.  The cache-tree codepath (which is used
 to write a tree object out of the index) however insisted that the
 object exists, even for paths that are outside of the partial
 checkout area.  The code has been updated to avoid such a check.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* mw/doc-typofixes (2018-10-07) 3 commits

 Typofixes.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* nd/per-worktree-ref-iteration (2018-10-07) 9 commits
 . SQUASH???
 . reflog expire: cover reflog from all worktrees
 . fsck: check HEAD and reflog from other worktrees
 . fsck: Move fsck_head_link() to get_default_heads() to avoid some globals
 . revision.c: better error reporting on ref from different worktrees
 . revision.c: correct a parameter name
 . refs: new ref types to make per-worktree refs visible to all worktrees
 . Add a place for (not) sharing stuff between worktrees
 . refs.c: indent with tabs, not spaces

 Ejected for now, as it seems to break t2025 when in 'pu'.


* np/log-graph-octopus-fix (2018-10-12) 1 commit
 - log: fix coloring of certain octopus merge shapes

 "git log --graph" showing an octopus merge sometimes miscounted the
 number of display columns it is consuming to show the merge and its
 parent commits, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* rs/subtree-fixes (2018-10-12) 5 commits
 - subtree: performance improvement for finding unexpected parent commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-12 at 2b47258e04)
 + subtree: improve decision on merges kept in split
 + subtree: use commits before rejoins for splits
 + subtree: make --ignore-joins pay attention to adds
 + subtree: refactor split of a commit into standalone method

 Various subtree fixes.

 Will merge to 'master'.
 Unless somebody objects, that is.


* sf/complete-stash-list (2018-10-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-12 at ff0e9a0805)
 + git-completion.bash: add completion for stash list

 The completion script (in contrib/) lerned to complete a handful of
 options "git stash list" command takes.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* tb/filter-alternate-refs (2018-10-09) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-12 at 21c14722f1)
 + transport.c: introduce core.alternateRefsPrefixes
 + transport.c: introduce core.alternateRefsCommand
 + transport.c: extract 'fill_alternate_refs_command'
 + transport: drop refnames from for_each_alternate_ref

 When pushing into a repository that borrows its objects from an
 alternate object store, "git receive-pack" that responds to the
 push request on the other side lists the tips of refs in the
 alternate to reduce the amount of objects transferred.  This
 sometimes is detrimental when the number of refs in the alternate
 is absurdly large, in which case the bandwidth saved in potentially
 fewer objects transferred is wasted in excessively large ref
 advertisement.  The alternate refs that are advertised are now
 configurable with a pair of configuration variables.

  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-10 at f78e14123c)
 + completion: support "git fetch --multiple"

 Teach bash completion that "git fetch --multiple" only takes remote
 names as arguments and no refspecs.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jt/fetch-tips-in-partial-clone (2018-09-21) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-12 at 521b3fb44d)
 + fetch: in partial clone, check presence of targets
 + connected: document connectivity in partial clones

 "git fetch $repo $object" in a partial clone did not correctly
 fetch the asked-for object that is referenced by an object in
 promisor packfile, which has been fixed.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 incompatible features are in use in the repository.

  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-10 at 9f0f1f770e)
 + gc: do not return error for prior errors in daemonized mode
 (this branch uses jn/gc-auto-prep.)

 "gc --auto" ended up calling exit(-1) upon error, which has been
 corrected to use exit(1).  Also the error reporting behaviour when
 daemonized has been updated to exit with zero status when stopping
 due to a previously discovered error (which implies there is no
 point running gc to improve the situation); we used to exit with
 failure in such a case.
