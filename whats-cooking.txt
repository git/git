What's cooking in git.git (May 2021, #01; Thu, 6)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'seen' (formerly 'pu'---proposed updates) while commits prefixed
with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

Release tarballs are available at:

[Graduated to 'master']

* ab/pathname-encoding-doc (2021-04-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-04-20 at a90562c59f)
 + doc: clarify the filename encoding in git diff

 Clarify that pathnames recorded in Git trees are most often (but
 not necessarily) encoded in UTF-8.


* ds/maintenance-prefetch-fix (2021-04-16) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-04-16 at 0a1818e235)
 + maintenance: respect remote.*.skipFetchAll
 + maintenance: use 'git fetch --prefetch'
 + fetch: add --prefetch option
 + maintenance: simplify prefetch logic

 The prefetch task in "git maintenance" assumed that "git fetch"
 from any remote would fetch all its local branches, which would
 fetch too much if the user is interested in only a subset of
 branches there.


* ds/sparse-index (2021-03-30) 21 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-04-07 at f1290a7929)
 + p2000: add sparse-index repos
 + sparse-index: loose integration with cache_tree_verify()
 + cache-tree: integrate with sparse directory entries
 + sparse-checkout: disable sparse-index
 + sparse-checkout: toggle sparse index from builtin
 + sparse-index: add index.sparse config option
 + sparse-index: check index conversion happens
 + unpack-trees: allow sparse directories
 + submodule: sparse-index should not collapse links
 + sparse-index: convert from full to sparse
 + sparse-index: add 'sdir' index extension
 + sparse-checkout: hold pattern list in index

 + sparse-index: add guard to ensure full index
 + t1092: clean up script quoting
 + t/perf: add performance test for sparse operations
 + sparse-index: design doc and format update
 (this branch is used by ds/sparse-index-protections and ds/status-with-sparse-index.)

 Both in-core and on-disk index has been updated to optionally omit
 individual entries and replace them with the tree object that
 corresponds to the directory that contains them when the "cone"
 mode of sparse checkout is in use.


* ds/sparse-index-protections (2021-04-14) 26 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-04-17 at f1c40f89ba)
 + name-hash: use expand_to_path()
 + sparse-index: expand_to_path()
 + name-hash: don't add directories to name_hash
 + revision: ensure full index
 + resolve-undo: ensure full index
 + read-cache: ensure full index
 + pathspec: ensure full index
 + merge-recursive: ensure full index
 + entry: ensure full index
 + dir: ensure full index
 + update-index: ensure full index
 + stash: ensure full index
 + rm: ensure full index

 + read-cache: expand on query into sparse-directory entry
 + *: remove 'const' qualifier for struct index_state
 + sparse-index: API protection strategy
 (this branch is used by ds/status-with-sparse-index; uses ds/sparse-index.)

 Builds on top of the sparse-index infrastructure to mark operations
 that are not ready to mark with the sparse index, causing them to
 fall back on fully-populated index that they always have worked with.


* hn/refs-trace-errno (2021-04-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-04-20 at 0816e49d22)
 + refs: print errno for read_raw_ref if GIT_TRACE_REFS is set

 Show errno in the trace output in the error codepath that calls
 read_raw_ref method.


* jk/promisor-optim (2021-04-13) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-04-15 at 41f303ef9b)
 + revision: avoid parsing with --exclude-promisor-objects
 + lookup_unknown_object(): take a repository argument
 + is_promisor_object(): free tree buffer after parsing
 (this branch is used by rs/repack-without-loosening-promised-objects.)

 Handling of "promisor packs" that allows certain objects to be
 missing and lazily retrievable has been optimized (a bit).


* mt/parallel-checkout-part-2 (2021-04-19) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-04-20 at d4779b8864)

 + parallel-checkout: support progress displaying
 + parallel-checkout: add configuration options
 + parallel-checkout: make it truly parallel

 (this branch is used by mt/parallel-checkout-part-3.)

 The checkout machinery has been taught to perform the actual
 write-out of the files in parallel when able.


* mt/pkt-write-errors (2021-04-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-04-16 at 4a82d89ff3)
 + pkt-line: do not report packet write errors twice

 When packet_write() fails, we gave an extra error message
 unnecessarily, which has been corrected.


* ow/push-quiet-set-upstream (2021-04-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-04-16 at 9466d4ef38)
 + transport: respect verbosity when setting upstream

 "git push --quiet --set-upstream" was not quiet when setting the
 upstream branch configuration, which has been corrected.


* so/log-diff-merge (2021-04-16) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-04-17 at 6c1eba8ee3)
 + doc/diff-options: document new --diff-merges features
 + diff-merges: introduce log.diffMerges config variable
 + diff-merges: adapt -m to enable default diff format
 + diff-merges: refactor set_diff_merges()
 + diff-merges: introduce --diff-merges=on

 "git log" learned "--diff-merges=<style>" option, with an
 associated configuration variable log.diffMerges.


* vs/completion-with-set-u (2021-04-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-04-20 at 179933f961)
 + completion: avoid aliased command lookup error in nounset mode

 Effort to make the command line completion (in contrib/) safe with
 "set -u" continues.

 + t5316: check behavior of pack-objects --depth=0
 + pack-objects: clamp negative window size to 0
 + t5300: check that we produced expected number of deltas

  (merged to 'next' on 2021-05-04 at 09bed89b60)

 "git submodule update --quiet" did not propagate the quiet option
 down to underlying "git fetch", which has been corrected.

 When we swapped the order of --3way fallback, we forgot to adjust
 the message we give when the first method fails and the second
 method is attempted (which used to be "direct application failed
 hence we try 3way", now it is the other way around).

 "git fast-export" offers a way to control how signed tags are
 handled; the mechanism has been extended to allow specifying how
 signed commits are handled as well.

 - git-p4: do not decode data from perforce by default
 - git-p4: avoid decoding more data from perforce

 "git p4" in Python-2 days used to accept a lot more kinds of data
 from Perforce server as uninterrupted byte sequence, but after
 switching to Python-3, too many things are expected to be in UTF-8,
 which broke traditional use cases.

 + config: allow overriding of global and system configuration
 + config: unify code paths to get global config paths
 + config: rename `git_etc_config()`

 Replace GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM mechanism to decline from reading the
 system-wide configuration file with GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM that lets
 users specify from which file to read the system-wide configuration
 (setting it to an empty file would essentially be the same as
 setting NOSYSTEM), and introduce GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL to override the
 per-user configuration in $HOME/.gitconfig.

  (merged to 'next' on 2021-05-04 at fb677877f7)
 + trailer: add new .cmd config option
 + docs: correct descript of trailer.<token>.command

 The way the command line specified by the trailer.<token>.command
 configuration variable receives the end-user supplied value was
 both error prone and misleading.  An alternative to achieve the
 same goal in a safer and more intuitive way has been added, as
 the trailer.<token>.cmd configuration variable, to replace it.
