What's cooking in git.git (May 2012, #05; Sun, 20)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.

I haven't tagged 1.7.11-rc0 as some of the late "fixup" patches still
haven't settled yet, but hopefully we can go directly to rc1 by the end of
the week.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches of the
repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* hv/submodule-alt-odb (2012-05-14) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-05-18 at 2f17ac8)
 + teach add_submodule_odb() to look for alternates

When peeking into object stores of submodules, the code forgot that they
might borrow objects from alternate object stores on their own.

* jk/ident-gecos-strbuf (2012-05-20) 13 commits
 - format-patch: refactor get_patch_filename
 - ident: use a dynamic strbuf in fmt_ident
 - ident: use full dns names to generate email addresses
 - ident: report passwd errors with a more friendly message
 - drop length limitations on gecos-derived names and emails
 - ident: don't write fallback username into git_default_name
 - fmt_ident: drop IDENT_WARN_ON_NO_NAME code
 - format-patch: use default email for generating message ids
 - fmt-merge-msg: don't use static buffer in record_person
 - move git_default_* variables to ident.c
 - move identity config parsing to ident.c
 - http-push: do not access git_default_email directly
 - ident: split setup_ident into separate functions

Fixes quite a lot of brokenness when ident information needs to be taken
from the system and cleans up the code.  The series seem to break tests
here and there along the way but at the end everything balances out ;-)

There is a late fix-up that still need to be merged for backward
compatibility for external users of the unpublished internal API.

from the latter.

[Stalled]

 - completion: respect $GIT_DIR
 - completion: use __gitdir() in _git_log()
 - tests: add tests for the bash prompt functions in the completion script

This is only the "correction" bits taken from the beginning of a larger
series that is to be rerolled.

* jc/apply-3way (2012-05-16) 12 commits
 - WIP: the message is bogus in apply:::check_patch()
 - apply: refactor "previous patch" logic
 - apply: a bit more comments on PATH_TO_BE_DELETED
 - apply: document --3way option
 - apply: allow rerere() upon --3way results
 - apply: register conflicted stages to the index
 - apply: plug the three-way merge logic in
 - apply: fall back on three-way merge
 - apply: accept -3/--3way command line option
 - apply: split load_preimage() helper function out
 - apply: refactor read_file_or_gitlink()
 - apply: clear_image() clears things a bit more
 (this branch is tangled with jc/wip-apply-3way.)

"git apply" learns to wiggle the base version and perform three-way merge
when a patch does not exactly apply to the version you have.

It turns out that it is somewhat unpleasant to handle add/add conflicts in
this code, but it seems necessary if we want to use "apply -3" to replace
the use of "apply --build-fake-ancestor" followed by the slow "merge" in
"am -3".

* jc/maint-push-refs-all (2012-05-04) 2 commits
 - get_fetch_map(): tighten checks on dest refs
 - fetch/push: allow refs/*:refs/*

Allows pushing and fetching refs/stash.
Not ready.
There still seem to be other bugs hiding (e.g. try pushing twice).

* jc/run-hook-env-1 (2012-03-11) 1 commit
 - run_hook(): enhance the interface to pass arbitrary environment

Not urgent.

Updates run_hook() API to be much less specific to "commit".  It would
only be useful if people start doing more interesting things with hooks.

* jc/split-blob (2012-04-03) 6 commits
 - chunked-object: streaming checkout
 - chunked-object: fallback checkout codepaths
 - bulk-checkin: support chunked-object encoding
 - bulk-checkin: allow the same data to be multiply hashed
 - new representation types in the packstream
 - packfile: use varint functions

Not ready.

I finished the streaming checkout codepath, but as explained in
127b177 (bulk-checkin: support chunked-object encoding, 2011-11-30),
these are still early steps of a long and painful journey. At least
pack-objects and fsck need to learn the new encoding for the series
to be usable locally, and then index-pack/unpack-objects needs to
learn it to be used remotely.

Given that I heard a lot of noise that people want large files, and
that I was asked by somebody at GitTogether'11 privately for an
advice on how to pay developers (not me) to help adding necessary
support, I am somewhat dissapointed that the original patch series
that was sent almost two months ago still remains here without much
comments and updates from the developer community. I even made the
interface to the logic that decides where to split chunks easily
replaceable, and I deliberately made the logic in the original patch
extremely stupid to entice others, especially the "bup" fanboys, to
come up with a better logic, thinking that giving people an easy
target to shoot for, they may be encouraged to help out. The plan is
not working :-(.

[Cooking]

* rs/dir-strbuf-read-recursive-fix (2012-05-11) 2 commits
 - dir: simplify fill_directory()
 - dir: respect string length argument of read_directory_recursive()

* nl/http-proxy-more (2012-05-11) 2 commits
 - http: rename HTTP_REAUTH to HTTP_AUTH_RETRY
 - http: Avoid limit of retrying request only twice

I queued only the later two patches from this series, even though they do
not make much sense without the first one that seems to need a bit more
work, so that we won't forget.

* mm/push-default-switch-warning (2012-04-26) 2 commits
 - t5541: warning message is given even with --quiet
 - push: start warning upcoming default change for push.default

Will squash the two, but this has to wait for a few release cycles.

[Discarded]

* cb/daemon-test-race-fix (2012-04-27) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-04-27 at 84bbcf8)
 + Revert "git-daemon wrapper to wait until daemon is ready"
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-04-24 at d5c30be)
 + git-daemon wrapper to wait until daemon is ready

Reverted from 'next' to replace it with js/daemon-test-race-fix.
