What's cooking in git.git (May 2024, #08; Mon, 20)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and
aren't considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL
to a message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity (of course they can be resubmit when new interests
arise).

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-scm/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

Release tarballs are available at:

[New Topics]

* es/chainlint-ncores-fix (2024-05-20) 3 commits
 - chainlint.pl: latch CPU count directly reported by /proc/cpuinfo
 - chainlint.pl: fix incorrect CPU count on Linux SPARC
 - chainlint.pl: make CPU count computation more robust

 The chainlint script (invoked during "make test") did nothing when
 it failed to detect the number of available CPUs.  It now falls
 back to 1 CPU to avoid the problem.

 the wrong order almost consistently, which has been corrected.

 - Merge branch 'ps/undecided-is-not-necessarily-sha1' into jc/undecided-is-not-necessarily-sha1-fix
 (this branch uses ps/undecided-is-not-necessarily-sha1.)

 The base topic started to make it an error for a command to leave
 the hash algorithm unspecified, which revealed a few commands that
 were not ready for the change.  Give users a knob to revert back to
 the "default is sha-1" behaviour as an escape hatch, and start
 fixing these breakages.

* tb/path-filter-fix (2024-01-31) 16 commits
 - bloom: introduce `deinit_bloom_filters()`
 - commit-graph: reuse existing Bloom filters where possible
 - object.h: fix mis-aligned flag bits table
 - commit-graph: new Bloom filter version that fixes murmur3
 - commit-graph: unconditionally load Bloom filters
 - bloom: prepare to discard incompatible Bloom filters
 - bloom: annotate filters with hash version
 - repo-settings: introduce commitgraph.changedPathsVersion
 - t4216: test changed path filters with high bit paths
 - t/helper/test-read-graph: implement `bloom-filters` mode
 - bloom.h: make `load_bloom_filter_from_graph()` public
 - t/helper/test-read-graph.c: extract `dump_graph_info()`
 - gitformat-commit-graph: describe version 2 of BDAT
 - commit-graph: ensure Bloom filters are read with consistent settings
 - revision.c: consult Bloom filters for root commits
 - t/t4216-log-bloom.sh: harden `test_bloom_filters_not_used()`

 The Bloom filter used for path limited history traversal was broken
 on systems whose "char" is unsigned; update the implementation and
 bump the format version to 2.

 Waiting for a final ack?

 . ewah: implement `ewah_bitmap_is_subset()`
 . Documentation/technical: describe pseudo-merge bitmaps format

 The pack-bitmap machinery learned to write pseudo-merge bitmaps,
 which act as imaginary octopus merges covering un-bitmapped
 reference tips. This enhances bitmap coverage, and thus,
 performance, for repositories with many references using bitmaps.
