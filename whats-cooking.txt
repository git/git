What's cooking in git.git (Apr 2017, #05; Tue, 25)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* jh/verify-index-checksum-only-in-fsck (2017-04-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-04-19 at a089b97d34)
 + read-cache: force_verify_index_checksum

 The index file has a trailing SHA-1 checksum to detect file
 corruption, and historically we checked it every time the index
 file is used.  Omit the validation during normal use, and instead
 verify only in "git fsck".

 There is an update to the test script as a follow-up.


* bw/submodule-with-bs-path (2017-04-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-04-19 at 692775477b)
 + submodule: prevent backslash expantion in submodule names

 "git submodule" script does not work well with strange pathnames.
 Protect it from a path with slashes in them, at least.


* dt/http-postbuffer-can-be-large (2017-04-13) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-04-19 at dc9de26fc9)
 + http.postbuffer: allow full range of ssize_t values

 Allow the http.postbuffer configuration variable to be set to a
 size that can be expressed in size_t, which can be larger than
 ulong on some platforms.


* dt/xgethostname-nul-termination (2017-04-18) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-04-19 at 4035f442cc)
 + xgethostname: handle long hostnames
 + use HOST_NAME_MAX to size buffers for gethostname(2)

 gethostname(2) may not NUL terminate the buffer if hostname does
 not fit; unfortunately there is no easy way to see if our buffer
 was too small, but at least this will make sure we will not end up
 using garbage past the end of the buffer.


* jh/string-list-micro-optim (2017-04-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-04-19 at 2a5e339df9)
 + string-list: use ALLOC_GROW macro when reallocing string_list

 The string-list API used a custom reallocation strategy that was
 very inefficient, instead of using the usual ALLOC_GROW() macro,
 which has been fixed.


* jh/unpack-trees-micro-optim (2017-04-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-04-19 at 970c47a2f9)
 + unpack-trees: avoid duplicate ODB lookups during checkout

 In a 2- and 3-way merge of trees, more than one source trees often
 end up sharing an identical subtree; optimize by not reading the
 same tree multiple times in such a case.


* jk/loose-object-fsck (2017-04-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-04-19 at 0cc7810018)
 + sha1_file: remove an used fd variable

 Code cleanup.


* jk/ls-files-recurse-submodules-fix (2017-04-18) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-04-19 at d4682ceaae)
 + ls-files: fix path used when recursing into submodules
 + ls-files: fix recurse-submodules with nested submodules

 "ls-files --recurse-submodules" did not quite work well in a
 project with nested submodules.


* jk/quarantine-received-objects (2017-04-16) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-04-19 at 2c6fcf1d6d)
 + refs: reject ref updates while GIT_QUARANTINE_PATH is set
 + receive-pack: document user-visible quarantine effects
 + receive-pack: drop tmp_objdir_env from run_update_hook

 Add finishing touches to a recent topic.


* jk/snprintf-cleanups (2017-04-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-04-19 at 4a18ea9971)
 + replace: plug a memory leak

 Hotfix for a topic that is already in 'master'.


* jt/fetch-pack-error-reporting (2017-04-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-04-19 at 6da61f7236)
 + fetch-pack: show clearer error message upon ERR

 "git fetch-pack" was not prepared to accept ERR packet that the
 upload-pack can send with a human-readable error message.  It
 showed the packet contents with ERR prefix, so there was no data
 loss, but it was redundant to say "ERR" in an error message.


* km/t1400-modernization (2017-04-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-04-19 at 7490be39bf)
 + t1400: use consistent style for test_expect_success calls

 Code cleanup.


* nd/conditional-config-include (2017-04-14) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-04-19 at 2e94c40b46)
 + config: resolve symlinks in conditional include's patterns
 + path.c: and an option to call real_path() in expand_user_path()

 $GIT_DIR may in some cases be normalized with all symlinks resolved
 while "gitdir" path expansion in the pattern does not receive the
 same treatment, leading to incorrect mismatch.  This has been fixed.


* rs/misc-cppcheck-fixes (2017-04-17) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-04-19 at e8fca7f593)
 + server-info: avoid calling fclose(3) twice in update_info_file()
 + files_for_each_reflog_ent_reverse(): close stream and free strbuf on error
 + am: close stream on error, but not stdin

 Various small fixes.


* sb/checkout-recurse-submodules (2017-04-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-04-19 at 414e18fd9b)
 + submodule: remove a superfluous second check for the "new" variable

 Code cleanup.


* sr/http-proxy-configuration-fix (2017-04-13) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-04-19 at d8f507e951)
 + http: fix the silent ignoring of proxy misconfiguraion
 + http: honor empty http.proxy option to bypass proxy

 "http.proxy" set to an empty string is used to disable the usage of
 proxy.  We broke this early last year.


* tb/doc-eol-normalization (2017-04-13) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-04-19 at fe15d04d0a)
 + gitattributes.txt: document how to normalize the line endings

 Doc update.


* xy/format-patch-base (2017-04-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-04-19 at c10723d486)
 + doc: trivial typo in git-format-patch.txt

 Doc cleanup.

[New Topics]

* jh/verify-index-checksum-only-in-fsck (2017-04-25) 1 commit
 - t1450: avoid use of "sed" on the index, which is a binary file

 Update an unportable constructin a new test.

 Will merge to 'next' and then to 'master'.


* dt/gc-ignore-old-gc-logs (2017-04-24) 3 commits
 - test-lib: retire $remove_trash variable
 - test-lib.sh: do not barf under --debug at the end of the test
 - test-lib: abort when can't remove trash directory

 An attempt to allow us notice "fishy" situation where we fail to
 remove the temporary directory used during the test.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/war-on-git-path (2017-04-20) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-04-23 at 212e0a58ff)
 + am: drop "dir" parameter from am_state_init
 + replace strbuf_addstr(git_path()) with git_path_buf()
 + replace xstrdup(git_path(...)) with git_pathdup(...)
 + use git_path_* helper functions
 + branch: add edit_description() helper
 + bisect: add git_path_bisect_terms helper

 While handy, "git_path()" is a dangerous function to use as a
 callsite that uses it safely one day can be broken by changes
 to other code that calls it.  Reduction of its use continues.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* nd/fopen-errors (2017-04-23) 17 commits
 - warn_failure_to_open_read_optional_path(): a new helper
 - t1308: add a test case on open a config directory
 - config.c: handle error on failing to fopen()
 - xdiff-interface.c: report errno on failure to stat() or fopen()
 - wt-status.c: report error on failure to fopen()
 - server-info: report error on failure to fopen()
 - sequencer.c: report error on failure to fopen()
 - rerere.c: report correct errno
 - rerere.c: report error on failure to fopen()
 - remote.c: report error on failure to fopen()
 - commit.c: report error on failure to fopen() the graft file
 - log: report errno on failure to fopen() a file
 - clone: use xfopen() instead of fopen()
 - blame: report error on open if graft_file is a directory
 - bisect: report on fopen() error
 - config.mak.uname: set FREAD_READS_DIRECTORIES for Linux and FreeBSD
 - git_fopen: fix a sparse 'not declared' warning

 We often try to open a file for reading whose existence is
 optional, and silently ignore errors from open/fopen; report such
 errors if they are not due to missing files.

 Expecting a reroll that would be much simplified thanks to a higher
 level helper.

* dt/raise-core-packed-git-limit (2017-04-20) 1 commit
 - Increase core.packedGitLimit

 Raise the default packed-git limit value on larger platforms to
 avoid "git fetch" from a (recoverable) failure while "gc" is
 running in parallel.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/complete-checkout-sans-dwim-remote (2017-04-23) 1 commit
 - completion: optionally disable checkout DWIM

 Completion for "git checkout <branch>" that auto-creates the branch
 out of a remote tracking branch can now be disabled, as this
 completion often gets in the way when completing to checkout an
 existing local branch that happens to share the same prefix with
 bunch of remote tracking branches.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/update-links-in-docs (2017-04-20) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-04-23 at f64249bbdf)
 + docs/bisect-lk2009: update java code conventions link
 + docs/bisect-lk2009: update nist report link
 + docs/archimport: quote sourcecontrol.net reference
 + gitcore-tutorial: update broken link
 + doc: replace or.cz gitwiki link with git.wiki.kernel.org
 + doc: use https links to avoid http redirect

 Many stale HTTP(s) links have been updated in our documentation.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* js/larger-timestamps (2017-04-24) 8 commits
 - use uintmax_t for timestamps
 - date.c: abort if the system time cannot handle one of our timestamps
 - timestamp_t: introduce a new data type for timestamps
 - PRItime: introduce a new "printf format" for timestamps
 - parse_timestamp(): specify explicitly where we parse timestamps
 - t0006 & t5000: skip "far in the future" test when time_t is too limited
 - t0006 & t5000: prepare for 64-bit timestamps
 - ref-filter: avoid using `unsigned long` for catch-all data type

 Some platforms have ulong that is smaller than time_t, and our
 historical use of ulong for timestamp would mean they cannot
 represent some timestamp that the platform allows.  Invent a
 separate and dedicated timestamp_t (so that we can distingiuish
 timestamps and a vanilla ulongs, which along is already a good
 move), and then declare uintmax_t is the type to be used as the
 timestamp_t

 At v5.

* sf/putty-w-args (2017-04-20) 1 commit

 Plug a memleak.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ab/align-perf-descriptions (2017-04-23) 1 commit
 - t/perf: correctly align non-ASCII descriptions in output

 Output from perf tests have been updated to align their titles.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 - grep & rev-list doc: stop promising libpcre for --perl-regexp
 - log: add -P as a synonym for --perl-regexp
 - log: add exhaustive tests for pattern style options & config
 - grep: add a test for backreferences in PCRE patterns
 - Makefile & configure: reword outdated comment about PCRE
 - grep: remove redundant `regflags &= ~REG_EXTENDED` assignments
 - grep: remove redundant regflags assignment under PCRE
 - grep: submodule-related case statements should die if new fields are added
 - grep: add tests for grep pattern types being passed to submodules
 - grep: amend submodule recursion test in preparation for rx engine testing

 PCRE2, which has an API different from and incompatible with PCRE,
 can now be chosen to support "grep -P -e '<pattern>'" and friends.

* sh/grep-tree-obj-tweak-output (2017-01-20) 2 commits
 - grep: use '/' delimiter for paths
 - grep: only add delimiter if there isn't one already

 "git grep", when fed a tree-ish as an input, shows each hit
 prefixed with "<tree-ish>:<path>:<lineno>:".  As <tree-ish> is
 almost always either a commit or a tag that points at a commit, the
 early part of the output "<tree-ish>:<path>" can be used as the
 name of the blob and given to "git show".  When <tree-ish> is a
 tree given in the extended SHA-1 syntax (e.g. "<commit>:", or
 "<commit>:<dir>"), however, this results in a string that does not
 name a blob (e.g. "<commit>::<path>" or "<commit>:<dir>:<path>").
 "git grep" has been taught to be a bit more intelligent about these
 cases and omit a colon (in the former case) or use slash (in the
 latter case) to produce "<commit>:<path>" and
 "<commit>:<dir>/<path>" that can be used as the name of a blob.

 Expecting a reroll?  Is this good enough with known limitations?


* jc/diff-b-m (2015-02-23) 5 commits
 . WIPWIP
 . WIP: diff-b-m
 - diffcore-rename: allow easier debugging
 - diffcore-rename.c: add locate_rename_src()
 - diffcore-break: allow debugging

 "git diff -B -M" produced incorrect patch when the postimage of a
 completely rewritten file is similar to the preimage of a removed
 file; such a resulting file must not be expressed as a rename from
 other place.

 The fix in this patch is broken, unfortunately.

 Will discard.

* jk/parse-options-no-no-no (2017-04-19) 2 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - parse-options: disallow double-negations of options starting with no-

 Command line options that begin with "--no-" (e.g. "--no-checkout"
 option of "git clone") can be negated by removing "--no-"; we
 historically also allowed prefixing an extra "no" to the option
 (e.g. "--no-no-checkout"), which made the command line look ugly
 and unusual.  This proposes to forbid it.

 While I agree there is no need to support "--no-no-checkout", this
 looks more like "if it looks ugly and unusual, you do not have to
 use it".  Perhaps we can drop it?

  (merged to 'next' on 2017-04-23 at b5c28345a9)
 + t2027: avoid using pipes

 Having a git command on the upstream side of a pipe in a test
 script will hide the exit status from the command, which may cause
 us to fail to notice a breakage; rewrite tests in a script to avoid
 this issue.

* mg/name-rev-debug (2017-03-31) 4 commits
 - describe: pass --debug down to name-rev
 - name-rev: provide debug output
 - name-rev: favor describing with tags and use committer date to tiebreak

 "git describe --debug --contains" did not add any meaningful
 information, even though without "--contains" it did.

 Expecting a reroll of the tip two.

* nd/prune-in-worktree (2017-04-24) 12 commits
 - rev-list: expose and document --single-worktree

 - files-backend: make reflog iterator go through per-worktree reflog
 - revision.c: --all adds HEAD from all worktrees
 - refs: remove dead for_each_*_submodule()
 - revision.c: use refs_for_each*() instead of for_each_*_submodule()
 - refs: add refs_head_ref()
 - refs: move submodule slash stripping code to get_submodule_ref_store

 - revision.c: refactor add_index_objects_to_pending()
 - revision.h: new flag in struct rev_info wrt. worktree-related refs
 (this branch uses nd/worktree-kill-parse-ref.)

 "git gc" and friends when multiple worktrees are used off of a
 single repository did not consider the index and per-worktree refs
 of other worktrees as the root for reachability traversal, making
 objects that are in use only in other worktrees to be subject to
 garbage collection.

 Expecting a reroll.
 Waiting for nd/worktree-kill-parse-ref to settle.

 - bundle v3: the beginning
 - bundle: keep a copy of bundle file name in the in-core bundle header
 - bundle: plug resource leak
 - bundle doc: 'verify' is not about verifying the bundle

 The beginning of "split bundle", which could be one of the
 ingredients to allow "git clone" traffic off of the core server
 network to CDN.
