What's cooking in git.git (Sep 2022, #05; Mon, 19)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a future
release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and aren't
considered "accepted" at all.  A topic without enough support may be
discarded after a long period of no activity.

A few more topics have been merged to the 'master' branch.  We plan
to tag -rc1 in a few days (but expect no movement on 'master' or
'next' tomorrow).  There are a few topics that are marked with the
"Merge to 'next'?"  marker, which can use your help ;-)  After -rc1
gets tagged, the 'master' branch will go in the "regression fixes
only" mode (cf. https://tinyurl.com/gitCal).

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

Release tarballs are available at:
