What's cooking in git.git (Sep 2023, #08; Mon, 25)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and
aren't considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL
to a message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity (of course they can be resubmit when new interests
arise).

With Contributors' Summit happening this week, the early part of
the week may be slower than usual (my response time will certainly
be longer).

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

Release tarballs are available at:

* ps/revision-cmdline-stdin-not (2023-09-25) 1 commit
 - revision: make pseudo-opt flags read via stdin behave consistently

 "git rev-list --stdin" learned to take non-revisions (like "--not")
 recently from the standard input, but the way such a "--not" was
 handled was quite confusing, which has been rethought.  This is
 potentially a change that breaks backward compatibility.

  (merged to 'next' on 2023-09-22 at 1d069e900b)

 The command line completion script (in contrib/) can be told to
 complete aliases by including ": git <cmd> ;" in the alias to tell
 it that the alias should be completed similar to how "git <cmd>" is
 completed.  The parsing code for the alias as been loosened to
 allow ';' without an extra space before it.

* kn/rev-list-ignore-missing-links (2023-09-20) 1 commit
 - revision: add `--ignore-missing-links` user option

 Surface the .ignore_missing_links bit that stops the revision
 traversal from stopping and dying when encountering a missing
 object to a new command line option of "git rev-list", so that the
 objects that are required but are missing can be enumerated.

* so/diff-merges-d (2023-09-11) 2 commits
 - diff-merges: introduce '-d' option
 - diff-merges: improve --diff-merges documentation

 Teach a new "-d" option that shows the patch against the first
 parent for merge commits (which is "--diff-merges=first-parent -p").

 Letting a less useful combination of options squat on short-and-sweet "-d" feels dubious.

* pw/rebase-sigint (2023-09-07) 1 commit
 - rebase -i: ignore signals when forking subprocesses

 If the commit log editor or other external programs (spawned via
 "exec" insn in the todo list) receive internactive signal during
 "git rebase -i", it caused not just the spawned program but the
 "Git" process that spawned them, which is often not what the end
 user intended.  "git" learned to ignore SIGINT and SIGQUIT while
 waiting for these subprocesses.

 Expecting a reroll.
