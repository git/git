What's cooking in git.git (May 2022, #05; Mon, 16)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen',
and aren't considered "accepted" at all.

There are too many topics that are marked as "Will merge to next?"
that can use a gentle reminder like "no, the issue raised at $URL
hasn't been resolved yet for that" or "yes, we have discussed it
long and poked at it hard enough and there is no holes".

This cycle will conclude in early July (https://tinyurl.com/gitCal);
we are in week #4 of the cycle.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

Release tarballs are available at:

 corrected.

* ab/hooks-regression-fix (2022-04-21) 6 commits
 - hook API: fix v2.36.0 regression: hooks should be connected to a TTY
 - hook API: don't redundantly re-set "no_stdin" and "stdout_to_stderr"

 - run-command: add an "ungroup" option to run_process_parallel()
 - run-command tests: test stdout of run_command_parallel()
 - run-command API: replace run_processes_parallel_tr2() with opts struct

 In Git 2.36 we revamped the way how hooks are invoked.  One change
 that is end-user visible is that the output of a hook is no longer
 directly connected to the standard output of "git" that spawns the
 hook, which was noticed post release.  This is getting corrected.

 - push: default to single remote even when not named origin
 - branch: new autosetupmerge option 'simple' for matching branches

 "git -c branch.autosetupmerge=simple branch $A $B" will set the $B
 as $A's upstream only when $A and $B shares the same name, and "git
 -c push.default=simple" on branch $A would push to update the
 branch $A at the remote $B came from.  Also more places use the
 sole remote, if exists, before defaulting to 'origin'.
