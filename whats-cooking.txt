What's cooking in git.git (Nov 2024, #03; Mon, 4)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and
aren't considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL
to a message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity (of course they can be resubmit when new interests
arise).

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-scm/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/

 - doc: correct misleading descriptions for --shallow-exclude
 - upload-pack: fix ambiguous error message

 The "--shallow-exclude=<ref>" option to various history transfer
 commands takes a ref, not an arbitrary revision.

* ds/full-name-hash (2024-11-04) 7 commits
 - test-tool: add helper for name-hash values
 - pack-objects: disable --full-name-hash when shallow
 - p5313: add size comparison test
 - git-repack: update usage to match docs
 - pack-objects: add GIT_TEST_FULL_NAME_HASH

 "git pack-objects" and its wrapper "git repack" learned an option
 to use an alternative path-hash function to improve delta-base
 selection to produce a packfile with deeper history than window
 size.

* jt/repack-local-promisor (2024-11-03) 5 commits
 - fixup! index-pack: repack local links into promisor packs
 - index-pack: repack local links into promisor packs
 - t5300: move --window clamp test next to unclamped
 - t0410: use from-scratch server
 - t0410: make test description clearer

 "git gc" discards any objects that are outside promisor packs that
 are referred to by an object in a promisor pack, and we do not
 refetch them from the promisor at runtime, resulting an unusable
 repository.  Work it around by including these objects in the
 referring promisor pack at the receiving end of the fetch.

 Needs review.
 Breaks CI (with a known fix).

* cc/promisor-remote-capability (2024-09-10) 4 commits
 - promisor-remote: check advertised name or URL
 - Add 'promisor-remote' capability to protocol v2
 - strbuf: refactor strbuf_trim_trailing_ch()
 - version: refactor strbuf_sanitize()

 The v2 protocol learned to allow the server to advertise possible
 promisor remotes, and the client to respond with what promissor
 remotes it uses, so that the server side can omit objects that the
 client can lazily obtain from these other promissor remotes.

 Comments?  I got an impression that this is premature without
 finishing the discussion on a larger picture.

 "git fsck" learned to issue warnings on "curiously formatted" ref
 contents that have always been taken valid but something Git
