What's cooking in git.git (May 2022, #04; Thu, 12)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen',
and aren't considered "accepted" at all.

There unfortunately are still a few regressions whose fixes have
been reviewed but not yet rerolled.

 - hooks no longer is connected directly to the standard output.
   cf. <CA+dzEBn108QoMA28f0nC8K21XT+Afua0V2Qv8XkR8rAeqUCCZw@mail.gmail.com>

 - "sudo make install" does not work out-of-the-box.
   cf. <4ef9287b-6260-9538-7c89-cffb611520ee@maurel.de>

With these fixed soon, a new maintenance release needs to follow.

The tip of 'next' has been rewound and rebuilt, after the remaining
topics that have been cooking in 'next' from the previous cycle have
been flushed to 'master'.

This cycle will conclude in early July (https://tinyurl.com/gitCal);
we are in week #3 of the cycle.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

* ab/hooks-regression-fix (2022-04-21) 6 commits
 - hook API: fix v2.36.0 regression: hooks should be connected to a TTY
 - hook API: don't redundantly re-set "no_stdin" and "stdout_to_stderr"
 - hook tests: fix redirection logic error in 96e7225b310

 - run-command tests: test stdout of run_command_parallel()
 - run-command API: replace run_processes_parallel_tr2() with opts struct

 In Git 2.36 we revamped the way how hooks are invoked.  One change
 that is end-user visible is that the output of a hook is no longer
 directly connected to the standard output of "git" that spawns the
 hook, which was noticed post release.  This is getting corrected.

  (merged to 'next' on 2022-05-12 at dc93e4e93a)
 + log: "--since-as-filter" option is a non-terminating "--since" variant

 "git log --since=X" will stop traversal upon seeing a commit that
 is older than X, but there may be commits behind it that is younger
 than X when the commit was created with a faulty clock.  A new
 option is added to keep digging without stopping, and instead
 filter out commits with timestamp older than X.

 - push: new config option "push.autoSetupRemote" supports "simple" push
 - push: default to single remote even when not named origin
 - branch: new autosetupmerge option 'simple' for matching branches

 "git -c branch.autosetupmerge=simple branch $A $B" will set the $B
 as $A's upstream only when $A and $B shares the same name, and "git
 -c push.default=simple" on branch $A would push to update the
 branch $A at the remote $B came from.  Also more places use the
 sole remote, if exists, before defaulting to 'origin'.
