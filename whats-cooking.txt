What's cooking in git.git (Dec 2010, #01; Sat, 4)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones
marked with '.' do not appear in any of the integration branches, but I am
still holding onto them.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* aa/status-hilite-branch (2010-11-18) 1 commit
 - status: show branchname with a configurable color

I am indifferent/uninterested; I don't see anything wrong with it, but I
do not find coloring the field particularly useful myself.

* ef/help-cmd-prefix (2010-11-26) 2 commits
 - (jc) review comments
 - help: always suggest common-cmds if prefix of cmd

Reroll, or squash?

* jn/fast-import-blob-access (2010-12-03) 5 commits
 - t9300: remove unnecessary use of /dev/stdin
 - fast-import: Allow cat-blob requests at arbitrary points in stream
 - fast-import: let importers retrieve blobs
 - fast-import: clarify documentation of "feature" command
 - fast-import: stricter parsing of integer options

Will merge to 'next' soon.

 - gitweb: document $per_request_config better
 - gitweb: selectable configurations that change with each request

Will merge to 'next' soon.

* kb/diff-C-M-synonym (2010-11-29) 1 commit
 - diff: add --detect-copies-harder as a synonym for --find-copies-harder

 - cvsimport.txt: document the mapping between config and options
 - cvsimport: fix the parsing of uppercase config options
 - cvsimport: partial whitespace cleanup

I was being lazy and said "Ok" to "cvsimport.capital-r" but luckily other
people injected sanity to the discussion.  Weatherbaloon patch sent, but
not queued here.

* mz/maint-rebase-stat-config (2010-11-09) 1 commit
 - rebase: only show stat if configured to true

Will merge to 'next' soon.

Debian specific addition, can wait (or just left for the distro).

* nd/index-doc (2010-09-06) 1 commit
 - doc: technical details about the index file format

Half-written but it is a good start.  I may need to give some help in
describing more recent index extensions.

* cb/ignored-paths-are-precious (2010-08-21) 1 commit
 - checkout/merge: optionally fail operation when ignored files need to be overwritten

This needs tests; also we know of longstanding bugs in related area that
needs to be addressed---they do not have to be part of this series but
their reproduction recipe would belong to the test script for this topic.

It would hurt users to make the new feature on by default, especially the
ones with subdirectories that come and go.

 - Why is "git tag --contains" so slow?
 - default core.clockskew variable to one day
 - limit "contains" traversals based on commit timestamp
 - tag: speed up --contains calculation

The idea of the bottom one is probably Ok, except that the use of object
flags needs to be rethought, or at least the helper needs to be moved to
builtin/tag.c to make it clear that it should not be used outside the
current usage context.

* tr/config-doc (2010-10-24) 2 commits
 . Documentation: complete config list from other manpages
 . Documentation: Move variables from config.txt to separate file

This unfortunately heavily conflicts with patches in flight...
