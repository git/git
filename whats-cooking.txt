What's cooking in git.git (Sep 2023, #05; Fri, 15)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and
aren't considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL
to a message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity (of course they can be resubmit when new interests
arise).

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

Release tarballs are available at:

 If the commit log editor or other external programs (spawned via

 "git rebase -i", it caused not just the spawned program but the
 "Git" process that spawned them, which is often not what the end
 user intended.  "git" learned to ignore SIGINT and SIGQUIT while
 waiting for these subprocesses.

* jc/update-index-show-index-version (2023-09-12) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2023-09-13 at b754554df8)
 + test-tool: retire "index-version"
 + update-index: add --show-index-version
 + update-index doc: v4 is OK with JGit and libgit2

 "git update-index" learns "--show-index-version" to inspect
 the index format version used by the on-disk index file.

 Will merge to 'master'.

* jc/unresolve-removal (2023-07-31) 7 commits
 - checkout: allow "checkout -m path" to unmerge removed paths
 - checkout/restore: add basic tests for --merge
 - checkout/restore: refuse unmerging paths unless checking out of the index
 - update-index: remove stale fallback code for "--unresolve"
 - update-index: use unmerge_index_entry() to support removal
 - resolve-undo: allow resurrecting conflicted state that resolved to deletion
 - update-index: do not read HEAD and MERGE_HEAD unconditionally
 (this branch is used by jc/rerere-cleanup.)

 "checkout --merge -- path" and "update-index --unresolve path" did
 not resurrect conflicted state that was resolved to remove path,
 but now they do.

 Needs review.

* rj/status-bisect-while-rebase (2023-08-01) 1 commit
 - status: fix branch shown when not only bisecting

 "git status" is taught to show both the branch being bisected and
 being rebased when both are in effect at the same time.

 Needs review.
