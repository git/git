What's cooking in git.git (Feb 2024, #01; Fri, 2)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and
aren't considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL
to a message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity (of course they can be resubmit when new interests
arise).

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/

  (merged to 'next' on 2024-01-24 at e77b796e11)
 + setup: allow cwd=.git w/ bareRepository=explicit

 The "disable repository discovery of a bare repository" check,
 triggered by setting safe.bareRepository configuration variable to
 'explicit', has been loosened to exclude the ".git/" directory inside
 a non-bare repository from the check.  So you can do "cd .git &&
 git cmd" to run a Git command that works on a bare repository without
 explicitly specifying $GIT_DIR now.

  (merged to 'next' on 2024-01-30 at 376b9c9c1b)
 + t: mark tests regarding git-pack-refs(1) to be backend specific
 + t5526: break test submodule differently
 + t1419: mark test suite as files-backend specific
 + t1302: make tests more robust with new extensions
 + t1301: mark test for `core.sharedRepository` as reffiles specific
 + t1300: make tests more robust with non-default ref backends
 (this branch is used by ps/reftable-backend.)

 Prepare existing tests on refs to work better with non-default
 backends.

* cp/apply-core-filemode (2023-12-26) 3 commits
 - apply: code simplification
 - apply: correctly reverse patch's pre- and post-image mode bits
 - apply: ignore working tree filemode when !core.filemode

 "git apply" on a filesystem without filemode support have learned
 to take a hint from what is in the index for the path, even when
 not working with the "--index" or "--cached" option, when checking
 the executable bit match what is required by the preimage in the
 patch.
