What's cooking in git.git (Jul 2017, #06; Thu, 20)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

Tagging of -rc1 is delayed, waiting for a resolution on the l10n
issues around '"%"PRItime' custome format specifier, which naturally
cannot be handled by gettext(1) suite nicely.  I think what is queued
on 'pu' based on Dscho's suggestion is a usable workaround, and I
plan to use it unless I hear better ideas in the comint 10+ hours.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

[Graduated to "master"]

* ew/fd-cloexec-fix (2017-07-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-18 at a3de1b1998)
 + set FD_CLOEXEC properly when O_CLOEXEC is not supported

 Portability/fallback fix.


* jk/build-with-asan (2017-07-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-18 at f92636c616)
 + Makefile: allow combining UBSan with other sanitizers

 A recent update made it easier to use "-fsanitize=" option while
 compiling but supported only one sanitize option.  Allow more than
 one to be combined, joined with a comma, like "make SANITIZE=foo,bar".


* jk/test-copy-bytes-fix (2017-07-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-18 at c32c264e96)
 + t: handle EOF in test_copy_bytes()

 A test fix.


* js/alias-case-sensitivity (2017-07-17) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-18 at 31641a39f2)
 + alias: compare alias name *case-insensitively*
 + t1300: demonstrate that CamelCased aliases regressed

 A recent update broke an alias that contained an uppercase letter.


* mt/p4-parse-G-output (2017-07-13) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-18 at e065b689d4)
 + git-p4: filter for {'code':'info'} in p4CmdList
 + git-p4: parse marshal output "p4 -G" in p4 changes
 + git-p4: git-p4 tests with p4 triggers

 Use "p4 -G" to make "p4 changes" output more Python-friendly
 to parse.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* bw/push-options-recursively-to-submodules (2017-07-20) 1 commit
 - submodule--helper: teach push-check to handle HEAD

 "git push --recurse-submodules $there HEAD:$target" was not
 propagated down to the submodules, but now it is.

 Will merge to and cook in 'next'.


* jc/http-sslkey-and-ssl-cert-are-paths (2017-07-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-20 at 5489304b99)
 + http.c: http.sslcert and http.sslkey are both pathnames

 The http.{sslkey,sslCert} configuration variables are to be
 interpreted as a pathname that honors "~[username]/" prefix, but
 weren't, which has been fixed.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* jc/po-pritime-fix (2017-07-20) 1 commit
 - Makefile: help gettext tools to cope with our custom PRItime format

 We started using "%" PRItime, imitating "%" PRIuMAX and friends, as
 a way to format the internal timestamp value, but this does not
 play well with gettext(1) i18n framework, and causes "make pot"
 that is run by the l10n coordinator to create a broken po/git.pot
 file.  This is a possible workaround for that problem.

 Will fast-track to 2.14-rc1 once we hear positive result.


* jt/fsck-code-cleanup (2017-07-20) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-20 at f7045a8c47)
 + object: remove "used" field from struct object
 + fsck: remove redundant parse_tree() invocation

 Code clean-up.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* rs/pack-objects-pbase-cleanup (2017-07-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-20 at a6b618559b)
 + pack-objects: remove unnecessary NULL check

 Code clean-up.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* st/lib-gpg-kill-stray-agent (2017-07-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-20 at 8ea68c483f)
 + t: lib-gpg: flush gpg agent on startup

 Some versions of GnuPG fails to kill gpg-agent it auto-spawned
 and such a left-over agent can interfere with a test.  Work it
 around by attempting to kill one before starting a new test.

* mg/status-in-progress-info (2017-05-10) 2 commits
 - status --short --inprogress: spell it as --in-progress
 - status: show in-progress info for short status

 "git status" learns an option to report various operations
 (e.g. "merging") that the user is in the middle of.

* sg/clone-refspec-from-command-line-config (2017-06-16) 2 commits
 - Documentation/clone: document ignored configuration variables
 - clone: respect additional configured fetch refspecs during initial fetch
 (this branch is used by sg/remote-no-string-refspecs.)

 "git clone -c var=val" is a way to set configuration variables in
 the resulting repository, but it is more useful to also make these
 variables take effect while the initial clone is happening,
 e.g. these configuration variables could be fetch refspecs.

 Waiting for a response.

* ks/commit-abort-on-empty-message-fix (2017-07-17) 1 commit
 - commit: check for empty message before the check for untouched template

 "git commit" when seeing an totally empty message said "you did not
 edit the message", which is clearly wrong.  The message has been
 corrected.

 Code clean-up.

* hb/gitweb-project-list (2017-07-18) 1 commit
 - gitweb: skip unreadable subdirectories

 When a directory is not readable, "gitweb" fails to build the
 project list.  Work this around by skipping such a directory.

 Undecided.

 It might end up hiding a problem under the rug and a better
 solution might be to loudly complain to the administrator pointing
 out the problematic directory, but this will at least make it
 "work".


* jk/ref-filter-colors (2017-07-13) 15 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-18 at 75d4eb7ecf)
 + ref-filter: consult want_color() before emitting colors
 + pretty: respect color settings for %C placeholders
 + rev-list: pass diffopt->use_colors through to pretty-print
 + for-each-ref: load config earlier
 + color: check color.ui in git_default_config()
 + ref-filter: pass ref_format struct to atom parsers
 + ref-filter: factor out the parsing of sorting atoms
 + ref-filter: make parse_ref_filter_atom a private function
 + ref-filter: provide a function for parsing sort options
 + ref-filter: move need_color_reset_at_eol into ref_format
 + ref-filter: abstract ref format into its own struct
 + ref-filter: simplify automatic color reset
 + t: use test_decode_color rather than literal ANSI codes
 + docs/for-each-ref: update pointer to color syntax
 + check return value of verify_ref_format()

 "%C(color name)" in the pretty print format always produced ANSI
 color escape codes, which was an early design mistake.  They now
 honor the configuration (e.g. "color.ui = never") and also tty-ness
 of the output medium.

  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-18 at 48d9650a30)
 + hook: add a simple first example
 + hook: add sign-off using "interpret-trailers"
 + hook: name the positional variables
 + hook: cleanup script

 Remove an example that is now obsolete from a sample hook,
 and improve an old example in it that added a sign-off manually
 to use the interpret-trailers command.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* jc/allow-lazy-cas (2017-07-06) 1 commit
 - push: disable lazy --force-with-lease by default

 Because "git push --force-with-lease[=<ref>]" that relies on the
 stability of remote-tracking branches is unsafe when something
 fetches into the repository behind user's back, it is now disabled
 by default.  A new configuration variable can be used to enable it
 by users who know what they are doing.  This would pave the way to
 possibly turn `--force` into `--force-with-lease`.

 Undecided.

 Independent from disabling the feature by default, this stirred up
 a discussion to replace the DWIM heuristics with a better one, which
 deserves to be its own topic.

* jk/reflog-walk (2017-07-09) 9 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-09 at 7449e964c6)

 + reflog-walk: stop using fake parents
 + rev-list: check reflog_info before showing usage

 + log: do not free parents when walking reflog
 + log: clarify comment about reflog cycles
 + revision: disallow reflog walking with revs->limited
 + t1414: document some reflog-walk oddities
 + Merge branch 'jk/reflog-walk-maint' into jk/reflog-walk

 Numerous bugs in walking of reflogs via "log -g" and friends have
 been fixed.

* sb/hashmap-cleanup (2017-07-05) 10 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-12 at ce31d06165)
 + t/helper/test-hashmap: use custom data instead of duplicate cmp functions
 + name-hash.c: drop hashmap_cmp_fn cast
 + submodule-config.c: drop hashmap_cmp_fn cast
 + remote.c: drop hashmap_cmp_fn cast
 + patch-ids.c: drop hashmap_cmp_fn cast
 + convert/sub-process: drop cast to hashmap_cmp_fn
 + config.c: drop hashmap_cmp_fn cast
 + builtin/describe: drop hashmap_cmp_fn cast
 + builtin/difftool.c: drop hashmap_cmp_fn cast
 + attr.c: drop hashmap_cmp_fn cast

 Many uses of comparision callback function the hashmap API uses
 cast the callback function type when registering it to
 hashmap_init(), which defeats the compile time type checking when
 the callback interface changes (e.g. gaining more parameters).
 The callback implementations have been updated to take "void *"
 pointers and cast them to the type they expect instead.

* ex/deprecate-empty-pathspec-as-match-all (2017-06-23) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-06-26 at d026281517)
 + pathspec: die on empty strings as pathspec
 + t0027: do not use an empty string as a pathspec element

 The final step to make an empty string as a pathspec element
 illegal.  We started this by first deprecating and warning a
 pathspec that has such an element in 2.11 (Nov 2016).

 Hopefully we can merge this down to the 'master' by the end of the
 year?  A deprecation warning period that is about 1 year does not
 sound too bad.

* mh/packed-ref-store (2017-07-03) 30 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-05 at 6c68c603cc)

 + branch: add a --copy (-c) option to go with --move (-m)
 + branch: add test for -m renaming multiple config sections
 + config: create a function to format section headers

 "git branch" learned "-c/-C" to create and switch to a new branch
 by copying an existing one.

 Will cook in 'next'.

 I personally do not think "branch --copy master backup" while on
 "master" that switches to "backup" is a good UI, and I *will* say
 "I told you so" when users complain after we merge this down to
 'master'.

 + convert: add "status=delayed" to filter process protocol

 + convert: put the flags field before the flag itself for consistent style
 + t0021: write "OUT <size>" only on success

 lines.

 objects that are in use only in other worktrees to be subject to
 garbage collection.
