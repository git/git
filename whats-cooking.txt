What's cooking in git.git (Sep 2017, #03; Fri, 15)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

We are at week #6 of this cycle.  It seems that people had a
productive week while I was away, which I am reasonably happy about
;-)  Quite a many topics that have been in 'master' are now also
merged to 'maint', so perhaps I should tag 2.14.2 soonish.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* cc/subprocess-handshake-missing-capabilities (2017-09-11) 1 commit
 - subprocess: loudly die when subprocess asks for an unsupported capability

 Finishing touches to a topic already in 'master'.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* bw/protocol-v1 (2017-09-14) 8 commits
 - i5700: add interop test for protocol transition
 - http: tell server that the client understands v1
 - connect: tell server that the client understands v1
 - connect: teach client to recognize v1 server response
 - upload-pack, receive-pack: introduce protocol version 1
 - daemon: recognize hidden request arguments
 - protocol: introduce protocol extention mechanisms
 - pkt-line: add packet_write function

 A new mechanism to upgrade the wire protocol in place is proposed
 and demonstrated that it works with the older versions of Git
 without harming them.


* ez/doc-duplicated-words-fix (2017-09-14) 1 commit
 - doc: fix minor typos (extra/duplicated words)

 Typofix.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/write-in-full-fix (2017-09-14) 8 commits
 - read_pack_header: handle signed/unsigned comparison in read result
 - config: flip return value of store_write_*()
 - notes-merge: use ssize_t for write_in_full() return value
 - pkt-line: check write_in_full() errors against "< 0"
 - convert less-trivial versions of "write_in_full() != len"
 - avoid "write_in_full(fd, buf, len) != len" pattern
 - get-tar-commit-id: check write_in_full() return against 0
 - config: avoid "write_in_full(fd, buf, len) < len" pattern

 Many codepaths did not diagnose write failures correctly when disks
 go full, due to their misuse of write_in_full() helper function,
 which have been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jn/per-repo-object-store-fixes (2017-09-14) 3 commits
 - replace-objects: evaluate replacement refs without using the object store
 - push, fetch: error out for submodule entries not pointing to commits
 - pack: make packed_git_mru global a value instead of a pointer

 Step #0 of a planned & larger series.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ks/commit-do-not-touch-cut-line (2017-09-15) 1 commit
 - commit-template: change a message to be more intuitive

 The explanation of the cut-line in the commit log editor has been
 slightly tweaked.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ks/help-alias-label (2017-09-14) 1 commit
 - help: change a message to be more precise

 "git help co" now says "co is aliased to ...", not "git co is".

 Will merge to 'next'.


* mh/mmap-packed-refs (2017-09-14) 20 commits
 - packed-backend.c: rename a bunch of things and update comments
 - mmapped_ref_iterator: inline into `packed_ref_iterator`
 - ref_cache: remove support for storing peeled values
 - packed_ref_store: get rid of the `ref_cache` entirely
 - ref_store: implement `refs_peel_ref()` generically
 - packed_read_raw_ref(): read the reference from the mmapped buffer
 - packed_ref_iterator_begin(): iterate using `mmapped_ref_iterator`
 - read_packed_refs(): ensure that references are ordered when read
 - packed_ref_cache: keep the `packed-refs` file open and mmapped
 - mmapped_ref_iterator_advance(): no peeled value for broken refs
 - mmapped_ref_iterator: add iterator over a packed-refs file
 - packed_ref_cache: remember the file-wide peeling state
 - read_packed_refs(): read references with minimal copying
 - read_packed_refs(): make parsing of the header line more robust
 - read_packed_refs(): only check for a header at the top of the file
 - read_packed_refs(): use mmap to read the `packed-refs` file
 - die_unterminated_line(), die_invalid_line(): new functions
 - packed_ref_cache: add a backlink to the associated `packed_ref_store`
 - prefix_ref_iterator: break when we leave the prefix
 - ref_iterator: keep track of whether the iterator output is ordered
 (this branch uses mh/packed-ref-transactions.)

 Operations that do not touch (majority of) packed refs have been
 optimized by making accesses to packed-refs file lazy; we no longer
 pre-parse everything, and an access to a single ref in the
 packed-refs does not touch majority of irrelevant refs, either.

 Expecting a rework to also work on Windows.


* nm/imap-send-with-curl (2017-09-15) 4 commits
 - imap-send: use curl by default when possible
 - imap_send: setup_curl: retreive credentials if not set in config file
 - imap-send: add wrapper to get server credentials if needed
 - imap-send: return with error if curl failed

 "git imap-send" has our own implementation of the protocol and also
 can use more recent libCurl with the imap protocol support.  Update
 the latter so that it can use the credential subsystem, and then
 make it the default option to use, so that we can eventually
 deprecate and remove the former.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* rj/test-ulimit-on-windows (2017-09-15) 1 commit
 - test-lib: don't use ulimit in test prerequisites on cygwin
 (this branch uses mg/name-rev-tests-with-short-stack.)

 On Cygwin, "ulimit -s" does not report failure but it does not work
 at all, which causes an unexpected success of some tests that
 expect failures under a limited stack situation.  This has been
 fixed.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* rs/archive-excluded-directory (2017-09-14) 1 commit
 - archive: don't add empty directories to archives

 "git archive", especially when used with pathspec, stored an empty
 directory in its output, even though Git itself never does so.
 This has been fixed.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* tg/refs-allowed-flags (2017-09-14) 1 commit
 - refs: strip out not allowed flags from ref_transaction_update

 API error-proofing which happens to also squelch warnings from GCC.

 Will merge to 'next'.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* mg/status-in-progress-info (2017-05-10) 2 commits
 - status --short --inprogress: spell it as --in-progress
 - status: show in-progress info for short status

 "git status" learns an option to report various operations
 (e.g. "merging") that the user is in the middle of.

 cf. <xmqqmvakcdqw.fsf@gitster.mtv.corp.google.com>


* nd/worktree-move (2017-04-20) 6 commits
 - worktree remove: new command
 - worktree move: refuse to move worktrees with submodules
 - worktree move: accept destination as directory
 - worktree move: new command
 - worktree.c: add update_worktree_location()
 - worktree.c: add validate_worktree()

 "git worktree" learned move and remove subcommands.

 Expecting a reroll.

* sg/clone-refspec-from-command-line-config (2017-06-16) 2 commits
 - Documentation/clone: document ignored configuration variables
 - clone: respect additional configured fetch refspecs during initial fetch
 (this branch is used by sg/remote-no-string-refspecs.)

 "git clone -c var=val" is a way to set configuration variables in
 the resulting repository, but it is more useful to also make these
 variables take effect while the initial clone is happening,
 e.g. these configuration variables could be fetch refspecs.

 Waiting for a response.

 - rebase -i: remove useless indentation
 - rebase -i: generate the script via rebase--helper
 - t3415: verify that an empty instructionFormat is handled as before

 The final batch to "git rebase -i" updates to move more code from
 the shell script to C.

 Expecting a reroll.


* bp/fsmonitor (2017-06-12) 6 commits
 - fsmonitor: add a sample query-fsmonitor hook script for Watchman
 - fsmonitor: add documentation for the fsmonitor extension.
 - fsmonitor: add test cases for fsmonitor extension
 - fsmonitor: teach git to optionally utilize a file system monitor to speed up detecting new or changed files.
 - dir: make lookup_untracked() available outside of dir.c
 - bswap: add 64 bit endianness helper get_be64

 We learned to talk to watchman to speed up "git status".

 Expecting a reroll.

* bb/doc-eol-dirty (2017-09-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-09-14 at 2f0cb688c6)
 + Documentation: mention that `eol` can change the dirty status of paths

 Doc update.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jh/hashmap-disable-counting (2017-09-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-09-14 at bbc08f4222)
 + hashmap: add API to disable item counting when threaded

 Our hashmap implementation in hashmap.[ch] is not thread-safe when
 adding a new item needs to expand the hashtable by rehashing; add
 an API to disable the automatic rehashing to work it around.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/incore-lockfile-removal (2017-09-06) 20 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-09-14 at 603dae7fb2)
 + stop leaking lock structs in some simple cases
 + ref_lock: stop leaking lock_files
 + lockfile: update lifetime requirements in documentation
 + tempfile: auto-allocate tempfiles on heap
 + tempfile: remove deactivated list entries
 + tempfile: use list.h for linked list
 + tempfile: release deactivated strbufs instead of resetting
 + tempfile: robustify cleanup handler
 + tempfile: factor out deactivation
 + tempfile: factor out activation
 + tempfile: replace die("BUG") with BUG()
 + tempfile: handle NULL tempfile pointers gracefully
 + tempfile: prefer is_tempfile_active to bare access
 + lockfile: do not rollback lock on failed close
 + tempfile: do not delete tempfile on failed close
 + always check return value of close_tempfile
 + verify_signed_buffer: prefer close_tempfile() to close()
 + setup_temporary_shallow: move tempfile struct into function
 + setup_temporary_shallow: avoid using inactive tempfile
 + write_index_as_tree: cleanup tempfile on error

 The long-standing rule that an in-core lockfile instance, once it
 is used, must not be freed, has been lifted and the lockfile and
 tempfile APIs have been updated to reduce the chance of programming
 errors.

* jk/leak-checkers (2017-09-08) 10 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-09-14 at 906ed9f590)
 + add UNLEAK annotation for reducing leak false positives
 + set_git_dir: handle feeding gitdir to itself
 + repository: free fields before overwriting them
 + reset: free allocated tree buffers
 + reset: make tree counting less confusing
 + config: plug user_config leak
 + update-index: fix cache entry leak in add_one_file()
 + add: free leaked pathspec after add_files_to_cache()
 + test-lib: set LSAN_OPTIONS to abort by default
 + test-lib: --valgrind should not override --verbose-log

 Many of our programs consider that it is OK to release dynamic
 storage that is used throughout the life of the program by simply
 exiting, but this makes it harder to leak detection tools to avoid
 reporting false positives.  Plug many existing leaks and introduce
 a mechanism for developers to mark that the region of memory
 pointed by a pointer is not lost/leaking to help these tools.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/system-path-cleanup (2017-09-07) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-09-14 at c6faaf8858)

* nm/pull-submodule-recurse-config (2017-09-07) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-09-14 at 38bf2c88e0)
 + pull: honor submodule.recurse config option

* rk/commit-tree-make-F-verbatim (2017-09-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-09-14 at 3d40c900f3)
 + commit-tree: do not complete line in -F input

 Unlike "git commit-tree < file", "git commit-tree -F file" did not
 pass the contents of the file verbatim and instead completed an
 incomplete line at the end, if exists.  The latter has been updated
 to match the behaviour of the former.

 As "git commit" to conclude a conflicted "git merge" honors the
 commit-msg hook, "git merge" that recoreds a merge commit that
 cleanly auto-merges should, but it didn't.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 "git gc" and friends when multiple worktrees are used off of a
 single repository did not consider the index and per-worktree refs
 of other worktrees as the root for reachability traversal, making
 objects that are in use only in other worktrees to be subject to
 garbage collection.

 . diff-delta: fix encoding size that would not fit in "unsigned int"

 The machinery to create xdelta used in pack files received the
 sizes of the data in size_t, but lost the higher bits of them by
 storing them in "unsigned int" during the computation, which is
 fixed.

 Dropped, as it was rerolled for review as part of a larger series.

* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2017-08-10) 1 commit
 . zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

 Dropped, as it was rerolled for review as part of a larger series.

 . diff-delta: do not allow delta offset truncation

 The delta format used in the packfile cannot reference data at
 offset larger than what can be expressed in 4-byte, but the
 generator for the data failed to make sure the offset does not
 overflow.  This has been corrected.

 Dropped, as it was rerolled for review as part of a larger series.

* sb/submodule-recursive-checkout-detach-head (2017-07-28) 2 commits
 - Documentation/checkout: clarify submodule HEADs to be detached
 - recursive submodules: detach HEAD from new state

 "git checkout --recursive" may overwrite and rewind the history of
 the branch that happens to be checked out in submodule
 repositories, which might not be desirable.  Detach the HEAD but
 still allow the recursive checkout to succeed in such a case.

 Undecided.
 This needs justification in a larger picture; it is unclear why
 this is better than rejecting recursive checkout, for example.


* ti/external-sha1dc (2017-08-16) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-26 at a0fb4e91a5)
 + sha1dc: allow building with the external sha1dc library
 + sha1dc: build git plumbing code more explicitly

 Platforms that ship with a separate sha1 with collision detection
 library can link to it instead of using the copy we ship as part of
 our source tree.

 Will merge to 'master'.

* jc/allow-lazy-cas (2017-07-06) 1 commit
 - push: disable lazy --force-with-lease by default

 Because "git push --force-with-lease[=<ref>]" that relies on the
 stability of remote-tracking branches is unsafe when something
 fetches into the repository behind user's back, it is now disabled
 by default.  A new configuration variable can be used to enable it
 by users who know what they are doing.  This would pave the way to
 possibly turn `--force` into `--force-with-lease`.

 Will discard.
 Independent from disabling the feature by default, this stirred up
 a discussion to replace the DWIM heuristics with a better one, which
 deserves to be its own topic.

* ex/deprecate-empty-pathspec-as-match-all (2017-06-23) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-14 at 24db08a6e8)
 + pathspec: die on empty strings as pathspec
 + t0027: do not use an empty string as a pathspec element

 The final step to make an empty string as a pathspec element
 illegal.  We started this by first deprecating and warning a
 pathspec that has such an element in 2.11 (Nov 2016).

 Hopefully we can merge this down to the 'master' by the end of the
 year?  A deprecation warning period that is about 1 year does not
 sound too bad.

 Will cook in 'next'.
 As the draft RelNotes says, let's merge this to 'master' after
 this release cycle.


* sd/branch-copy (2017-06-18) 3 commits
 - branch: add a --copy (-c) option to go with --move (-m)
 - branch: add test for -m renaming multiple config sections
 - config: create a function to format section headers

 "git branch" learned "-c/-C" to create and switch to a new branch
 by copying an existing one.

 I personally do not think "branch --copy master backup" while on
 "master" that switches to "backup" is a good UI, and I *will* say
 "I told you so" when users complain after we merge this down to
 'master'.
