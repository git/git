What's cooking in git.git (Feb 2018, #01; Wed, 7)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

Many new topics appeared and are not yet marked with "Will do what"
labels.  Except for some large ones, I think most are already in
good shape, but I'd want to double check by re-reading them.

I am migrating my build and integration environment to a different
machine; if you notice anything out of ordinary, please let me know
before I decomission and reimage my usual environment ;-)

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

* bp/untracked-cache-noflush (2018-02-05) 1 commit
 - dir.c: don't flag the index as dirty for changes to the untracked cache

 Writing out the index file when the only thing that changed in it
 is the untracked cache information is often wasteful, and this has
 been optimized out.

 Waiting for the discussion to finish.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jc/blame-missing-path (2018-02-07) 1 commit
 - blame: tighten command line parser

 "git blame HEAD COPYING" in a bare repository failed to run, while
 "git blame HEAD -- COPYING" run just fine.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jt/binsearch-with-fanout (2018-02-02) 2 commits
 - packfile: refactor hash search with fanout table
 - packfile: remove GIT_DEBUG_LOOKUP log statements

 Refactor the code to binary search starting from a fan-out table
 (which is how the packfile is indexed with object names) into a
 reusable helper.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* lw/daemon-log-destination (2018-02-05) 1 commit
 - daemon: add --log-destination=(stderr|syslog|none)

 The log from "git daemon" can be redirected with a new option; one
 relevant use case is to send the log to standard error (instead of
 syslog) when running it from inetd.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* tg/reset-hard-show-head-with-pretty (2018-02-02) 1 commit
 - reset --hard: make use of the pretty machinery

 The way "git reset --hard" reports the commit the updated HEAD
 points at is made consistent with the way how the commit title is
 generated by the other parts of the system.  This matters when the
 title is spread across physically multiple lines.

 Will merge to 'next'.

* dj/runtime-prefix (2017-12-05) 4 commits
 . exec_cmd: RUNTIME_PREFIX on some POSIX systems
 . Makefile: add Perl runtime prefix support
 . Makefile: add support for "perllibdir"
 . Makefile: generate Perl header from template file

 A build-time option has been added to allow Git to be told to refer
 to its associated files relative to the main binary, in the same
 way that has been possible on Windows for quite some time, for
 Linux, BSDs and Darwin.

 Tentatively kicked out of 'next' to see how well another topic
 ab/simplify-perl-makefile that heavily conflicts with this fares.


* mk/http-backend-content-length (2017-11-27) 4 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - t5560-http-backend-noserver.sh: add CONTENT_LENGTH cases
 - SQUASH???
 - http-backend: respect CONTENT_LENGTH as specified by rfc3875

 The http-backend (used for smart-http transport) used to slurp the
 whole input until EOF, without paying attention to CONTENT_LENGTH
 that is supplied in the environment and instead expecting the Web
 server to close the input stream.  This has been fixed.

 Expecting a reroll.
 Suggested fixes to be used when rerolling is queued, but I'd
 prefer _not_ squashing them myself.

 Also, it may be too complex solution for the problem.

* cc/require-tcl-tk-for-build (2017-11-29) 2 commits
 - travis-ci: avoid new tcl/tk build requirement
 - Makefile: check that tcl/tk is installed

 A first-time builder of Git may have installed neither tclsh nor
 msgfmt, in which case git-gui and gitk part will fail and break the
 build.  As a workaround, refuse to run a build when tclsh is not
 installed and NO_TCLTK is not set.

 Undecided.
 I still feel that requring tclsh to be installed, with or without
 "escape hatch" for experts, may be too heavy-handed.


* mg/merge-base-fork-point (2017-09-17) 3 commits
 - merge-base: find fork-point outside partial reflog
 - merge-base: return fork-point outside reflog
 - t6010: test actual test output

 "merge-base --fork-point $branch $commit" is used to guess on which
 commit among the commits that were once at the tip of the $branch the
 $commit was built on top of, and it learns these historical tips from
 the reflog of the $branch.  When the true fork-point is lost due to
 pruning of old reflog entries, the command does not give any output,
 because it has no way to guess correctly and does not want to mislead
 the user with a wrong guess.

 The command has been updated to give the best but not known to be
 correct guess, based on a hope that a merge-base between $commit and a
 virtual merge across all the reflog entries that still are available
 for $branch may still be a closer to the true fork-point than the
 merge-base between $commit and the current tip of the $branch.

 This may have to be offered by an additional option, to allow the
 users that are prepared to see a potentially incorrect guess to opt
 into the feature, without affecting the current callers that may not
 be prepared to accept a guess that is not known to be correct.

 What's the doneness of this one?


* jk/drop-ancient-curl (2017-08-09) 5 commits
 - http: #error on too-old curl
 - curl: remove ifdef'd code never used with curl >=7.19.4
 - http: drop support for curl < 7.19.4
 - http: drop support for curl < 7.16.0
 - http: drop support for curl < 7.11.1

 Some code in http.c that has bitrot is being removed.

 Expecting a reroll.


* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2017-08-10) 1 commit
 . zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

 Needs resurrecting by making sure the fix is good and still applies
 (or adjusted to today's codebase).


* mg/status-in-progress-info (2017-05-10) 2 commits
 - status --short --inprogress: spell it as --in-progress
 - status: show in-progress info for short status

 "git status" learns an option to report various operations
 (e.g. "merging") that the user is in the middle of.

 - fetch: don't redundantly NULL something calloc() gave us

 Clarify how configured fetch refspecs interact with the "--prune"
 option of "git fetch", and also add a handy short-hand for getting
 rid of stale tags that are locally held.

 Expecting a reroll.

* gs/retire-mru (2018-01-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-07 at 4b2e893911)
 + mru: Replace mru.[ch] with list.h implementation
 (this branch uses ot/mru-on-list.)

 Retire mru API as it does not give enough abstraction over
 underlying list API to be worth it.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ot/mru-on-list (2017-10-01) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-07 at ee1ee4ac79)

 I do not mind refraining from using these keywords in a foreign
 language in our codebase too much, but at the same time, renaming
 must be done a bit more thoughtfully.  When the original uses 'new'
 together with and in contrast to 'old', renaming 'new' must be done
 while preserving the pairing (which may involve renaming 'old' as
 well), for example.

 Backburnered, i.e. will drop if other topics start to conflict with
 it, but will accept rerolls.

 unnecessarily hard to reason about, but it should do.

* js/rebase-recreate-merge (2018-01-30) 10 commits
 - rebase -i: introduce --recreate-merges=[no-]rebase-cousins
 - pull: accept --rebase=recreate to recreate the branch topology
 - sequencer: handle autosquash and post-rewrite for merge commands
 - sequencer: make refs generated by the `label` command worktree-local

 - sequencer: fast-forward merge commits, if possible
 - sequencer: introduce the `merge` command
 - sequencer: introduce new commands to reset the revision
 - git-rebase--interactive: clarify arguments

 "git rebase" learned "--recreate-merges" to transplant the whole
 topology of commit graph elsewhere.

 Not learning anything other than the parent info from an existing
 merge was found unsatisfactory by some.  It is something that can
 be fixed incrementally without breaking end-user experience, I
 would think, by doing the same cherry-pick 3-way merge.

* np/send-email-header-parsing (2017-12-15) 1 commit
 - send-email: extract email-parsing code into a subroutine

 Code refactoring.

 Undecided but inclined to drop.  A "refactor" without the code that
 benefit from the refactoring is hard to tell from code churn whose
 only effect is potential to introduce bugs.

 (this branch uses en/merge-recursive-fixes.)

 Rename detection logic in "diff" family that is used in "merge" has
 learned to guess when all of x/a, x/b and x/c have moved to z/a,
 z/b and z/c, it is likely that x/d added in the meantime would also
 want to move to z/d by taking the hint that the entire directory
 'x' moved to 'z'.


* pw/sequencer-in-process-commit (2018-01-24) 14 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-07 at ab5961edd9)

 + commit: move post-rewrite code to libgit
 + Add a function to update HEAD after creating a commit
 + commit: move empty message checks to libgit
 + t3404: check intermediate squash messages

 The sequencer infrastructure is shared across "git cherry-pick",
 "git rebase -i", etc., and has always spawned "git commit" when it
 needs to create a commit.  It has been taught to do so internally,
 when able, by reusing the codepath "git commit" itself uses, which
 gives performance boost for a few tens of percents in some sample
 scenarios.

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2018-01-17

 In preparation for implementing narrow/partial clone, the machinery
 for checking object connectivity used by gc and fsck has been
 taught that a missing object is OK when it is referenced by a
 packfile specially marked as coming from trusted repository that
 promises to make them available on-demand and lazily.

 (this branch uses jh/fsck-promisors.)

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2018-01-17

 The machinery to clone & fetch, which in turn involves packing and
 unpacking objects, have been told how to omit certain objects using
 the filtering mechanism introduced by the jh/object-filtering
 topic, and also mark the resulting pack as a promisor pack to
 tolerate missing objects, taking advantage of the mechanism
 introduced by the jh/fsck-promisors topic.
