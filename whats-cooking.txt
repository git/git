What's cooking in git.git (Jun 2020, #01; Wed, 3)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

Git 2.27 has been tagged, and the first batch of topics (including
the "throw protocol v2 to the experimental group of features" thing)
have been merged to the 'master' branch.  I'm planning to rewind the
tip of 'next' in a not-so-distant future.

Seeing a handful of regression reports [*] immediately after a
feature release is made gives me a mixed feeling: people are eager
enough to help by reporting issues they encounter, but there are not
enough people who are eager enough to help by testing the tip of
'master' before the release.  Are there things we can do to help
them become early adopters so that they do not have to scramble
after the release?

* an/merge-single-strategy-optim (2020-05-19) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-05-20 at 8d5cacc8d1)
 + merge: optimization to skip evaluate_result for single strategy

 Code optimization for a common case.


* bk/p4-prepare-p4-only-fix (2020-05-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-05-24 at c1b4644b04)
 + git-p4.py: fix --prepare-p4-only error with multiple commits

 The "--prepare-p4-only" option is supposed to stop after replaying
 one changeset, but kept going (by mistake?)

* cb/t5608-cleanup (2020-05-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-05-24 at 2bfa581890)
 + t5608: avoid say() and use "skip_all" instead for consistency

 Test fixup.


* en/fast-import-looser-date (2020-05-31) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-05-31 at 49de9c07c5)
 + fast-import: add new --date-format=raw-permissive format

 Some repositories in the wild have commits that record nonsense
 committer timezone (e.g. rails.git); "git fast-import" learned an
 option to pass these nonsense timestamps intact to allow recreating
 existing repositories as-is.


* jn/experimental-opts-into-proto-v2 (2020-05-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-05-24 at 53cd664dfe)
 + config: let feature.experimental imply protocol.version=2

 "feature.experimental" configuration variable is to let volunteers
 easily opt into a set of newer features, which use of the v2
 transport protocol is now a part of.


* jx/pkt-line-doc-count-fix (2020-05-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-05-24 at 7115240db4)

 Docfix.


* la/diff-relative-config (2020-05-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-05-26 at b4604e6abc)
 + diff: add config option relative

 The commands in the "diff" family learned to honor "diff.relative"
 configuration variable.


* lo/sparse-universal-zero-init (2020-05-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-05-24 at 1f4ea6b348)
 + sparse: allow '{ 0 }' to be used without warnings

 We've adopted a convention that any on-stack structure can be
 initialized to have zero values in all fields with "= { 0 }", even
 when the first field happens to be a pointer, but sparse complained
 that a null pointer should be spelled NULL for a long time.  Start
 using -Wno-universal-initializer option to squelch it.


* mt/zsh-completion-optim (2020-05-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-05-31 at f5d02a5498)
 + completion: use native ZSH array pattern matching

 Command line completion (incontrib/) update.


* rs/checkout-b-track-error (2020-05-24) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-05-26 at 9220e43203)
 + checkout: improve error messages for -b with extra argument
 + checkout: add tests for -b and --track

 The error message from "git checkout -b foo -t bar baz" was
 confusing.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* jk/diff-memuse-optim-with-stat-unmatch (2020-06-02) 1 commit
 - diff: discard blob data from stat-unmatched pairs

 Reduce memory usage during "diff --quiet" in a worktree with too
 many stat-unmatched paths.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* js/reflog-anonymize-for-clone-and-fetch (2020-06-02) 1 commit
 - clone/fetch: anonymize URLs in the reflog

 The reflog entries for "git clone" and "git fetch" did not
 anonymize the URL they operated on.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* tb/t5318-cleanup (2020-06-02) 2 commits
 - t5318: test that '--stdin-commits' respects '--[no-]progress'

* dr/push-remoteref-fix (2020-04-23) 1 commit
 - remote.c: fix handling of %(push:remoteref)

 The "%(push:remoteref)" placeholder in the "--format=" argument of
 "git format-patch" (and friends) only showed what got explicitly
 configured, not what ref at the receiving end would be updated when
 "git push" was used, as it ignored the default behaviour (e.g. update
 the same ref as the source).

 Expecting a reroll.

 - lib-submodule-update: prepend "git" to $command
 - lib-submodule-update: consolidate --recurse-submodules
 - lib-submodule-update: add space after function name

 The effort to avoid using test_must_fail on non-git command continues.

 Expecting a reroll.

 The command line completion (in contrib/) learned to complete
 options that the "git switch" command takes.


* en/sparse-with-submodule-doc (2020-05-25) 1 commit
 - git-sparse-checkout: clarify interactions with submodules

 The effect of sparse checkout settings on submodules is documented.

 Needs review.

 The check in "git fsck" to ensure that the tree objects are sorted
 still had corner cases it missed unsorted entries.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ss/submodule-set-branch-in-c (2020-06-02) 1 commit
 - submodule: port subcommand 'set-branch' from shell to C

 Rewrite of parts of the scripted "git submodule" Porcelain command
 continues; this time it is "git submodule set-branch" subcommand's
 turn.

 Almost there.

* vs/complete-stash-show-p-fix (2020-05-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-05-24 at fcbff29a0f)
 + completion: don't override given stash subcommand with -p

 The command line completion script (in contrib/) tried to complete
 "git stash -p" as if it were "git stash push -p", but it was too
 aggressive and also affected "git stash show -p", which has been
 corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 prematurely throws an error and disconnects.  The communication has
 been updated to make it more robust.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 + t/helper: teach test-regex to report pattern errors (like REG_ILLSEQ)

 As FreeBSD is not the only platform whose regexp library reports
 a REG_ILLSEQ error when fed invalid UTF-8, add logic to detect that
 automatically and skip the affected tests.

 Will merge to 'master'.

* hn/refs-cleanup (2020-05-27) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-05-27 at aada2199e1)
 + reftable doc: use link: and urlencode to avoid dead links

 + reftable: file format documentation
 + refs: improve documentation for ref iterator
 + t: use update-ref and show-ref to reading/writing refs
 + refs.h: clarify reflog iteration order
 (this branch is used by hn/reftable.)

 Preliminary clean-ups around refs API, plus file format
 specification documentation for the reftable backend.

 Will merge to 'master' after squashing the fix in.
 We probably would want to squash the fix at the tip to an earlier
 step when we rewind the 'next' branch.


* hn/reftable (2020-05-28) 13 commits
 . Add reftable testing infrastructure
 . vcxproj: adjust for the reftable changes
 . Add GIT_DEBUG_REFS debugging mechanism
 . Reftable support for git-core
 . Add reftable library
 . Add .gitattributes for the reftable/ directory
 . Iterate over the "refs/" namespace in for_each_[raw]ref
 . Move REF_LOG_ONLY to refs-internal.h
 . Treat REVERT_HEAD as a pseudo ref
 . Treat CHERRY_PICK_HEAD as a pseudo ref
 . Treat BISECT_HEAD as a pseudo ref
 . Make refs_ref_exists public
 . Write pseudorefs through ref backends.
 (this branch uses hn/refs-cleanup.)

 A new refs backend "reftable" to replace the traditional
 combination of packed-refs files and one-file-per-ref loose refs
 has been implemented and integrated for improved performance and
 atomicity.

 Not quite--does not pass tests by itself.
