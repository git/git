What's cooking in git.git (Sep 2014, #03; Thu, 11)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.

The third batch of topics have graduated to 'master'.  There are too
many topics waiting to be in 'next' but without comments and reviews
on the list, which is somewhat disturbing.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

[Graduated to "master"]

* br/http-init-fix (2014-08-21) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-03 at 6d42f5e)
 + http: style fixes for curl_multi_init error check
 + http.c: die if curl_*_init fails

 Code clean-up.


* br/imap-send-simplify-tunnel-child-process (2014-09-02) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-04 at a182987)
 + imap-send: simplify v_issue_imap_cmd() and get_cmd_result() using starts_with()
 + imap-send.c: imap_folder -> imap_server_conf.folder
 + git-imap-send: simplify tunnel construction

 Code clean-up.


* dt/cache-tree-repair (2014-09-03) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-03 at 1c8ff65)
 + cache-tree: do not try to use an invalidated subtree info to build a tree
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-08-26 at 6faccdb)
 + cache-tree: Write updated cache-tree after commit
 + cache-tree: subdirectory tests
 + test-dump-cache-tree: invalid trees are not errors
 + cache-tree: create/update cache-tree on checkout

 Add a few more places in "commit" and "checkout" that make sure
 that the cache-tree is fully populated in the index.


* et/spell-poll-infinite-with-minus-one-only (2014-08-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-03 at 5be5957)
 + upload-pack: keep poll(2)'s timeout to -1

 We used to pass -1000 to poll(2), expecting it to also mean "no
 timeout", which should be spelled as -1.


* jk/contrib-subtree-make-all (2014-08-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-03 at 919d889)
 + subtree: make "all" default target of Makefile


* jk/fast-import-fixes (2014-08-25) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-04 at 74838e5)
 + fast-import: fix buffer overflow in dump_tags
 + fast-import: clean up pack_data pointer in end_packfile

 With sufficiently long refnames, fast-import could have overflown
 an on-stack buffer.


* jk/make-simplify-dependencies (2014-08-26) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-03 at 820a600)
 + Makefile: drop CHECK_HEADER_DEPENDENCIES code
 + Makefile: use `find` to determine static header dependencies
 + i18n: treat "make pot" as an explicitly-invoked target

 Admit that keeping LIB_H up-to-date, only for those that do not use
 the automatically generated dependencies, is a losing battle, and
 make it conservative by making everything depend on anything.


* jk/name-decoration-alloc (2014-08-27) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-04 at 05f0d29)
 + log-tree: use FLEX_ARRAY in name_decoration
 + log-tree: make name_decoration hash static
 + log-tree: make add_name_decoration a public function

 The API to allocate the structure to keep track of commit
 decoration was cumbersome to use, inviting lazy code to
 overallocate memory.


* jk/prune-top-level-refs-after-packing (2014-08-25) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-04 at bfe3873)
 + pack-refs: prune top-level refs like "refs/foo"

 After "pack-refs --prune" packed refs at the top-level, it failed
 to prune them.


* jn/unpack-trees-checkout-m-carry-deletion (2014-08-25) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-04 at e15803a)
 + checkout -m: attempt merge when deletion of path was staged
 + unpack-trees: use 'cuddled' style for if-else cascade
 + unpack-trees: simplify 'all other failures' case

 "git checkout -m" did not switch to another branch while carrying
 the local changes forward when a path was deleted from the index.


* mm/discourage-commit-a-to-finish-conflict-resolution (2014-08-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-03 at e3f872f)

* nd/fetch-pass-quiet-to-gc-child-process (2014-08-18) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-04 at 028cd42)
 + fetch: silence git-gc if --quiet is given
 + fetch: convert argv_gc_auto to struct argv_array

 Progress output from "git gc --auto" was visible in "git fetch -q".


* nd/large-blobs (2014-08-18) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-04 at 16d7c62)
 + diff: shortcut for diff'ing two binary SHA-1 objects
 + diff --stat: mark any file larger than core.bigfilethreshold binary
 + diff.c: allow to pass more flags to diff_populate_filespec
 + sha1_file.c: do not die failing to malloc in unpack_compressed_entry
 + wrapper.c: introduce gentle xmallocz that does not die()

 Teach a few codepaths to punt (instead of dying) when large blobs
 that would not fit in core are involved in the operation.


* nd/mv-code-cleaning (2014-09-03) 8 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-03 at 4315447)
 + mv: no SP between function name and the first opening parenthese
 + mv: combine two if(s)
 + mv: unindent one level for directory move code
 + mv: move index search code out
 + mv: remove an "if" that's always true
 + mv: split submodule move preparation code out
 + mv: flatten error handling code block
 + mv: mark strings for translations

 Code clean-up.


* rs/child-process-init (2014-08-20) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-03 at c17c06c)
 + run-command: inline prepare_run_command_v_opt()
 + run-command: call run_command_v_opt_cd_env() instead of duplicating it
 + run-command: introduce child_process_init()
 + run-command: introduce CHILD_PROCESS_INIT

 Code clean-up.


* rs/list-optim (2014-08-25) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-04 at eecaf99)
 + walker: avoid quadratic list insertion in mark_complete
 + sha1_name: avoid quadratic list insertion in handle_one_ref

 Fix a couple of "accumulate into a sorted list" to "accumulate and
 then sort the list".

* ta/config-set-1 (2014-08-07) 8 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-03 at 184b2ef)

[New Topics]

* jc/hash-object (2014-09-11) 3 commits
 - hash-object: add --literally option
 - hash-object: pass 'write_object' as a flag
 - hash-object: reduce file-scope statics
 (this branch is used by jc/hash-object-fsck-tag.)

 "hash-object" learned a new "--literally" option to hash any random
 garbage into a loose object, to allow us to create a test data for
 mechanisms to catch corrupt objects.

 (this branch uses jc/hash-object and js/fsck-tag-validation.)

 Using "hash-object --literally", test one of the new breakages
 js/fsck-tag-validation topic teaches "fsck" to catch is caught.


* jk/fsck-exit-code-fix (2014-09-10) 1 commit
 - fsck: exit with non-zero status upon error from fsck_obj()

 "git fsck" failed to report that it found corrupt objects via its
 exit status in some cases.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 (this branch is used by jc/hash-object-fsck-tag.)

 Teach "git fsck" to inspect the contents of annotated tag objects.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 - remote.c: use a transaction for deleting refs
 - refs.c: write updates to packed refs when a transaction has more than one ref
 - refs.c: move reflog updates into its own function
 - ### rs/ref-transaction-rename
 (this branch uses rs/ref-transaction, rs/ref-transaction-reflog and rs/ref-transaction-rename.)

 Follow-up on rs/ref-transaction series to use the packed-ref to
 achieve atomicity when multiple refs are involved.

 It appears that rs/ref-transaction series is being rerolled, so
 these will be rerolled as well.

 - ### rs/ref-transaction-reflog
 (this branch is used by rs/ref-transaction-multi; uses rs/ref-transaction and rs/ref-transaction-reflog.)

 Follow-up on rs/ref-transaction series to make renaming a ref
 transactional (i.e. "delete old and create new" should not leave
 an in-between state behind when it fails).

 It appears that rs/ref-transaction series is being rerolled, so
 these will be rerolled as well.


* rs/ref-transaction-reflog (2014-09-03) 16 commits
 - refs.c: allow deleting refs with a broken sha1
 - refs.c: remove lock_any_ref_for_update

 - refs.c: add a function to append a reflog entry to a fd
 - refs.c: add a new update_type field to ref_update
 - refs.c: rename the transaction functions
 - refs.c: make ref_transaction_delete a wrapper for ref_transaction_update
 - refs.c: make ref_transaction_create a wrapper to ref_transaction_update
 - ### rs/ref-transaction
 (this branch is used by rs/ref-transaction-multi and rs/ref-transaction-rename; uses rs/ref-transaction.)

 Cover updates to reflog with the same transaction mechanism as used
 for reflog manipulations.

 It appears that rs/ref-transaction series is being rerolled, so
 these will be rerolled as well.

 shared with the "mergetool" to reduce one shell dependency.

 Will be rerolled.

 - userdiff: support Java try keyword
 - userdiff: support C# async methods and correct C# keywords

 Reviews sent; waiting for a response.


* bg/rebase-off-of-previous-branch (2014-04-16) 1 commit
 - git-rebase: print name of rev when using shorthand

 Teach "git rebase -" to report the concrete name of the branch
 (i.e. the previous one).

 But it stops short and does not do the same for "git rebase @{-1}".
 Expecting a reroll.


* jk/makefile (2014-02-05) 16 commits
 . FIXUP
 . move LESS/LV pager environment to Makefile
 . Makefile: teach scripts to include make variables
 . FIXUP

 Simplify the Makefile rules and macros that exist primarily for
 quoting purposes, and make it easier to robustly express the
 dependency rules.

 Expecting a reroll.


* po/everyday-doc (2014-01-27) 1 commit
 - Make 'git help everyday' work

 This may make the said command to emit something, but the source is
 not meant to be formatted into a manual pages to begin with, and
 also its contents are a bit stale.  It may be a good first step in
 the right direction, but needs more work to at least get the
 mark-up right before public consumption.

 Waiting for a reroll (thread ending at $gmane/254746)


* rb/merge-prepare-commit-msg-hook (2014-01-10) 4 commits
 - merge: drop unused arg from abort_commit method signature
 - merge: make prepare_to_commit responsible for write_merge_state
 - t7505: ensure cleanup after hook blocks merge
 - t7505: add missing &&

 Expose more merge states (e.g. $GIT_DIR/MERGE_MODE) to hooks that
 run during "git merge".  The log message stresses too much on one
 hook, prepare-commit-msg, but it would equally apply to other hooks
 like post-merge, I think.

 Waiting for a reroll.


* jc/graph-post-root-gap (2013-12-30) 3 commits
 - WIP: document what we want at the end
 - graph: remove unused code a bit
 - graph: stuff the current commit into graph->columns[]

 - show-branch: use commit slab to represent bitflags of arbitrary width
 - show-branch.c: remove "all_mask"

 "log -p" output learns a new way to let users inspect a merge
 commit by showing the differences between the automerged result
 with conflicts the person who recorded the merge would have seen
 and the final conflict resolution that was recorded in the merge.

* bb/date-iso-strict (2014-08-29) 1 commit
 - pretty: provide a strict ISO 8601 date format

 "log --date=iso" uses a slight variant of ISO 8601 format that is
 made more human readable.  A new "--date=iso-strict" option gives
 datetime output that is more strictly conformant.

 - determine_author_info(): copy getenv output
 - determine_author_info(): reuse parsing functions
 - date: use strbufs in date-formatting functions

* jk/fast-export-anonymize (2014-08-28) 2 commits
 - docs/fast-export: explain --anonymize more completely
 - teach fast-export an --anonymize option

 Sometimes users want to report a bug they experience on their
 repository, but they are not at liberty to share the contents of
 the repository.  "fast-export" was taught an "--anonymize" option
 to replace blob contents, names of people and paths and log
 messages with bland and simple strings to help them.

* jk/index-pack-threading-races (2014-08-29) 1 commit
 - index-pack: fix race condition with duplicate bases

 When receiving an invalid pack stream that records the same object
 twice, multiple threads got confused due to a race.  We should
 reject or correct such a stream upon receiving, but that will be a
 larger change.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/send-pack-many-refspecs (2014-08-26) 1 commit
 - send-pack: take refspecs over stdin

 The number of refs that can be pushed at once over smart HTTP was
 limited by the command line length.  The limitation has been lifted
 by passing these refs from the standard input of send-pack.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jp/index-with-corrupt-stages (2014-08-29) 2 commits
 - read_index_unmerged(): remove unnecessary loop index adjustment
 - read_index_from(): catch out of order entries when reading an index file

 A broken reimplementation of Git could write an invalid index that
 records both stage #0 and higher stage entries for the same path.
 Notice and reject such an index, as there is no sensible fallback
 (we do not know if the broken tool wanted to resolve and forgot to
 remove higher stage entries, or if it wanted to unresolve and
 forgot to remove the stage#0 entry).

* mb/fast-import-delete-root (2014-08-29) 2 commits
 - fast-import: fix segfault in store_tree()
 - t9300: test filedelete command

 An attempt to remove the entire tree in the "git fast-import" input
 stream caused it to misbehave.

 Allow "git push" request to be signed, so that it can be verified
 audited, using the GPG signature of the person who pushed, that the
 tips of branches at a public repository really point the commits
 the pusher wanted to, without having to "trust" the server.

* mt/patch-id-stable (2014-06-10) 1 commit
 - patch-id: change default to stable

 Teaches "git patch-id" to compute the patch ID that does not change
 when the files in a single patch is reordered. As this new algorithm
 is backward incompatible, the last bit to flip it to be the default
 is left out of 'master' for now.

 Nobody seems to be jumping up & down requesting this last step.
 Perhaps will drop.
