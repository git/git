What's cooking in git.git (Dec 2020, #03; Fri, 18)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'seen' (formerly 'pu'---proposed updates) while commits prefixed
with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

A release candidate 2.30-rc1 has been tagged; there are too many
topics in flight, sadly many of which haven't been adequately
reviewed.  I think there are a couple of topics left in 'next' that
are obvious candidates for the final, but it would be lovely if we
can figure out how to get topics in 'seen' that haven't got enough
love unstuck.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/

[New Topics]

* jc/config-pretend-gitdir (2020-12-15) 1 commit
 - config: --pretend-git-dir for includeIf:gitdir

 WIP


* jc/deprecate-pack-redundant (2020-12-15) 1 commit
 - pack-redundant: gauge the usage before proposing its removal

 Warn loudly when the "pack-redundant" command, which has been left
 stale with almost unusable performance issues, gets used, as we no
 longer want to recommend its use (instead just "repack -d" instead).


* en/merge-ort-recursive (2020-12-16) 4 commits
 - merge-ort: implement merge_incore_recursive()
 - merge-ort: make clear_internal_opts() aware of partial clearing
 - merge-ort: copy a few small helper functions from merge-recursive.c
 - commit: move reverse_commit_list() from merge-recursive
 (this branch uses en/merge-ort-2 and en/merge-ort-impl; is tangled with en/merge-ort-3.)

 The ORT merge strategy learned to synthesize virtual ancestor tree
 by recursively merging multiple merge bases together, just like the
 recursive backend has done for years.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 which has been corrected.

* mt/rm-sparse-checkout (2020-12-08) 1 commit
 - rm: honor sparse checkout patterns
 (this branch uses mt/grep-sparse-checkout.)

 "git rm" follows suit to "git grep" to ignore paths outside the
 sparsity pattern when the sparse checkout feature is in use.

 Need to wait for how these fit in larger picture.

* jk/symlinked-dotgitx-files (2020-10-23) 9 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-10-26 at c1dd37b024)
 + docs: document symlink restrictions for .git* files
 + fsck: complain when .gitattributes or .gitignore is a symlink
 + verify_path(): disallow symlinks in .gitattributes and .gitignore
 + t0060: test obscured .gitattributes and .gitignore matching
 + t7450: test .gitmodules symlink matching against obscured names
 + t7450: test verify_path() handling of gitmodules
 + t7415: rename to expand scope
 + fsck_tree(): wrap some long lines
 + fsck_tree(): fix shadowed variable

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2020-10-23

 "git fsck" and the corresponding check done during the transport
 learned to ensure that in-tree files like `.gitignore` and
 `.gitattributes` are not symbolic links.

 It seems that there are real projects with .gitignore recorded as
 symlinks, which may need to loosen the fsck setting.  Do we need to
 introduce a class that is separate from symlinked .gitmodules that
 probably is with potential consequences that is more/less grave?


* sm/curl-retry (2020-10-13) 3 commits

 may reasonably be retried.

 - remote.c: fix handling of %(push:remoteref)

 The "%(push:remoteref)" placeholder in the "--format=" argument of
 "git format-patch" (and friends) only showed what got explicitly
 configured, not what ref at the receiving end would be updated when
 "git push" was used, as it ignored the default behaviour (e.g. update
 the same ref as the source).

 Discard for now.

* jk/disambiguate-equal-in-config-param (2020-12-09) 3 commits
 - config: store "git -c" variables using more robust format
 - config: parse more robust format in GIT_CONFIG_PARAMETERS
 - quote: make sq_dequote_step() a public function
 (this branch uses ps/config-env-pairs.)

 The quoting rules used to pass "git -c var=val" configuration
 across processes have been updated in a backward compatible way, so
 that the value read from an environment variable can contain an
 equal sign when using the "git --config-env var=env" feature.

 We may want to make this just a middle part of the
 ps/config-env-pairs topic with a bit of patch shuffling.

 - config: allow specifying config entries via envvar pairs

 via environment variables.

 The merge backend "done right" starts to emerge.

* ab/mktag (2020-12-09) 11 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - mktag: allow turning off fsck.extraHeaderEntry
 - fsck: make fsck_config() re-usable
 - mktag doc: update to explain why to use this
 - mktag: use fsck instead of custom verify_tag()
 - mktag tests: improve verify_object() test coverage
 - mktag tests: remove needless SHA-1 hardcoding
 - mktag tests: don't needlessly use a subshell
 - mktag: remove redundant braces in one-line body "if"
 - mktag: use default strbuf_read() hint
 - mktag doc: say <hash> not <sha1>

 "git mktag" validates its input using its own rules before writing
 a tag object---it has been updated to share the logic with "git
 fsck".

 Expecting a reroll, but it seems getting closer.


* ab/trailers-extra-format (2020-12-09) 5 commits

 The "--format=%(trailers)" mechanism gets enhanced to make it
 easier to design output for machine consumption.

 Will cook in 'next'.

* fc/pull-merge-rebase (2020-12-15) 5 commits
 - pull: display default warning only when non-ff
 - pull: correct condition to trigger non-ff advice
 - pull: get rid of unnecessary global variable
 - pull: give the advice for choosing rebase/merge much later
 - pull: refactor fast-forward check

 When a user does not tell "git pull" to use rebase or merge, the
 command gives a loud message telling a user to choose between
 rebase or merge but creates a merge anyway, forcing users who would
 want to rebase to redo the operation.  Fix an early part of this
 problem by tightening the condition to give the message---there is
 no reason to stop or force the user to choose between rebase or
 merge if the history fast-forwards.

 "git stash" did not work well in a sparsely checked out working

 Follow-up on the "maintenance part-3" which introduced scheduled
 maintenance tasks to support platforms whose native scheduling
 methods are not 'cron'.


* sj/untracked-files-in-submodule-directory-is-not-dirty (2020-12-08) 1 commit
 - diff: do not show submodule with untracked files as "-dirty"

 "git diff" showed a submodule working tree with untracked cruft as
 "Submodule commit <objectname>-dirty", but a natural expectation is
 that the "-dirty" indicator would align with "git describe --dirty",
 which does not consider having untracked files in the working tree
 as source of dirtiness.  The inconsistency has been fixed.
