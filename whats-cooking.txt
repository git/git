What's cooking in git.git (Oct 2011, #04; Wed, 12)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.

As reported earlier, 'next' has been rebuilt with some topics kicked back
to 'pu'.  Also, k.org is back.

The second wave of topics are starting to graduate to 'master'.

Here are the repositories that have my integration branches:

With maint, master, next, pu, todo, html and man:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git
	https://code.google.com/p/git-core/
	https://github.com/git/git

With only maint, master, html and man:

	git://git.sourceforge.jp/gitroot/git-core/git.git
	git://git-core.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/git-core/git-core

With all the topics and integration branches but not todo, html or man:

A re-roll already being discussed.

* js/merge-edit-option (2011-10-10) 2 commits
 - fixup! 0f6adfe2a26287c5c13366975f621c818bb3214d
 - Teach merge the '[-e|--edit]' option

The part to tweak builtin/merge.c in the fix-up should be removed but
otherwise ready to be squashed into one and merged to 'next'.

* mm/maint-config-explicit-bool-display (2011-10-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-10-11 at 795939f)
 + config: display key_delim for config --bool --get-regexp

 - fixup! 82d520bd
 - revert: Simplify passing command-line arguments around
 - revert: Allow mixed pick and revert instructions
 - revert: Make commit descriptions in insn sheet optional

* rs/diff-whole-function (2011-10-10) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-10-11 at 6196752)
 + diff: add option to show whole functions as context
 + xdiff: factor out get_func_line()

* rs/pickaxe (2011-10-07) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-10-11 at 27d02b2)

 + pickaxe: pass diff_options to contains and has_changes
 + pickaxe: factor out has_changes
 + pickaxe: plug regex/kws leak
 + pickaxe: plug regex leak
 + pickaxe: plug diff filespec leak with empty needle

* sc/difftool-skip (2011-10-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-10-11 at 38d7e84)
 + git-difftool: allow skipping file by typing 'n' at prompt

* sg/completion (2011-10-10) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-10-11 at 4724640)
 + completion: unite --format and --pretty for 'log' and 'show'
 + completion: unite --reuse-message and --reedit-message for 'notes'

 + fetch: plug two leaks on error exit in store_updated_refs

 - Restrict ref-like names immediately below $GIT_DIR
 - refs.c: move dwim_ref()/dwim_log() from sha1_name.c

An attempt to fix-up unfortunate side effect of mh/check-ref-format-3
topic. "git show -s config" is never meant to refer to $GIT_DIR/config
and treat it as a file that records an object name.

* jc/maint-remove-renamed-ref (2011-10-12) 1 commit
 - branch -m/-M: remove undocumented RENAMED-REF

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* cb/common-prefix-unification (2011-09-12) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-10-06 at 8349bca)
 + rename pathspec_prefix() to common_prefix() and move to dir.[ch]
 + consolidate pathspec_prefix and common_prefix
 + remove prefix argument from pathspec_prefix

Originally merged to 'next' on 2011-09-14.

* dm/tree-walk (2011-09-28) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-10-06 at 76e90c3)
 + tree-walk: micro-optimization in tree_entry_interesting
 + tree-walk: drop unused parameter from match_dir_prefix

Originally merged to 'next' on 2011-10-05.

* fg/submodule-git-file-git-dir (2011-08-22) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-10-06 at 3526bb9)
 + Move git-dir for submodules
 + rev-parse: add option --resolve-git-dir <path>

Originally merged to 'next' on 2011-08-23.

* hv/submodule-update-none (2011-08-11) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-10-06 at 4c105df)
 + add update 'none' flag to disable update of submodule by default
 + submodule: move update configuration variable further up

Originally merged to 'next' on 2011-08-24.

* jc/maint-diffstat-numstat-context (2011-09-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-10-06 at 36c972d)
 + diff: teach --stat/--numstat to honor -U$num

"diff" is allowed to match the common lines differently depending on how
many context lines it is showing, so running --(num)stat with 0 lines of
context internally gives a result that may be surprising to some people.

Originally merged to 'next' on 2011-09-26.

* jm/mergetool-pathspec (2011-09-26) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-10-06 at b8e830f)
 + mergetool: no longer need to save standard input
 + mergetool: Use args as pathspec to unmerged files

Originally merged to 'next' on 2011-09-26.

* jn/maint-http-error-message (2011-09-06) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-10-06 at 668a706)
 + http: avoid empty error messages for some curl errors
 + http: remove extra newline in error message

Originally merged to 'next' on 2011-09-12.

* jp/get-ref-dir-unsorted (2011-09-30) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-10-06 at 69fe65d)
 + refs: Use binary search to lookup refs faster
 + Don't sort ref_list too early

* mh/check-ref-format-3 (2011-10-05) 23 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-10-06 at c277498)
 + add_ref(): verify that the refname is formatted correctly
 + resolve_ref(): expand documentation
 + resolve_ref(): also treat a too-long SHA1 as invalid
 + resolve_ref(): emit warnings for improperly-formatted references
 + resolve_ref(): verify that the input refname has the right format
 + remote: avoid passing NULL to read_ref()
 + remote: use xstrdup() instead of strdup()
 + resolve_ref(): do not follow incorrectly-formatted symbolic refs
 + resolve_ref(): extract a function get_packed_ref()
 + resolve_ref(): turn buffer into a proper string as soon as possible
 + resolve_ref(): only follow a symlink that contains a valid, normalized refname
 + resolve_ref(): use prefixcmp()
 + resolve_ref(): explicitly fail if a symlink is not readable
 + Change check_refname_format() to reject unnormalized refnames
 + Inline function refname_format_print()
 + Make collapse_slashes() allocate memory for its result
 + Do not allow ".lock" at the end of any refname component
 + Refactor check_refname_format()
 + Change check_ref_format() to take a flags argument
 + Change bad_ref_char() to return a boolean value
 + git check-ref-format: add options --allow-onelevel and --refspec-pattern
 + t1402: add some more tests
 + get_sha1_hex(): do not read past a NUL character

An unpleasant minor side effect was discovered with this one. If you try
"git show -s config", the code warns that $GIT_DIR/config is not formatted
correctly as a ref, which is technically correct but totally unwarranted.

* mh/iterate-refs (2011-09-11) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-10-06 at c7a33e5)
 + refs.c: make create_cached_refs() static

 + Allocate cached_refs objects dynamically

 - url: decode buffers that are not NUL-terminated
 (this branch is used by js/cred-macos-x-keychain-2.)

Kicked back to 'pu' to allow design level discussions to continue.

* js/cred-macos-x-keychain-2 (2011-10-06) 1 commit
 - contrib: add a pair of credential helpers for Mac OS X's keychain
 (this branch uses jk/http-auth-keyring.)

Kicked back to 'pu' to allow design level discussions to continue.

* hv/submodule-merge-search (2011-08-26) 5 commits
 - submodule: Search for merges only at end of recursive merge
 - allow multiple calls to submodule merge search for the same path
 - submodule: Demonstrate known breakage during recursive merge
 - push: Don't push a repository with unpushed submodules
 - push: teach --recurse-submodules the on-demand option
 (this branch is tangled with fg/submodule-auto-push.)

The second from the bottom one needs to be replaced with a properly
written commit log message.

* fg/submodule-auto-push (2011-09-11) 2 commits
 - submodule.c: make two functions static
 - push: teach --recurse-submodules the on-demand option
 (this branch is tangled with hv/submodule-merge-search.)

What the topic aims to achieve may make sense, but the implementation
looked somewhat suboptimal.

* sr/transport-helper-fix-rfc (2011-07-19) 2 commits
 - t5800: point out that deleting branches does not work
 - t5800: document inability to push new branch with old content

Perhaps 281eee4 (revision: keep track of the end-user input from the
command line, 2011-08-25) would help.

* bc/attr-ignore-case (2011-10-11) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-10-11 at daa6b51)
 + attr.c: respect core.ignorecase when matching attribute patterns
 + attr: read core.attributesfile from git_default_core_config

* jc/lookup-object-hash (2011-08-11) 6 commits
 - object hash: replace linear probing with 4-way cuckoo hashing
 - object hash: we know the table size is a power of two
 - object hash: next_size() helper for readability
 - pack-objects --count-only
 - object.c: remove duplicated code for object hashing
 - object.c: code movement for readability

I do not think there is anything fundamentally wrong with this series, but
the risk of breakage far outweighs observed performance gain in one
particular workload. Will keep it in 'next' at least for one cycle.
