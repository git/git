What's cooking in git.git (Jun 2021, #05; Tue, 15)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen' while commits prefixed with '+'
are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of the
integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.  Generally,
being in 'next' is a sign that a topic is stable enough to be used
and are candidate to be in a future release, while being in 'seen'
means nothing more than that the maintainer has found it interesting
for some reason (like "it may have hard-to-resolve conflicts with
another topic already in flight" or "this may turn out to be
useful")---do not read too much into a topic being in (or not in)
'seen'.

With two batches of topics graduated from it, 'next' is now empty,
and I plan to rewind and rebuild it for this cycle soonish.  Please
stop me if you know any of the topics expected to be merged to
'next' in this issue of the report is premature.  Also accumulated
on 'seen' are too many topics that are expecting an update but have
been stalled for too long.  I expect I'll discard those that haven't
seen activity for more than a month, unless there are some updates
by the end of this month.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/

 + t: use configured TAR instead of tar

 Test portability fix.


* ds/write-index-with-hashfile-api (2021-05-19) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-05-28 at f0c51ddf7c)
 + read-cache: delete unused hashing methods
 + read-cache: use hashfile instead of git_hash_ctx
 + csum-file.h: increase hashfile buffer size
 + hashfile: use write_in_full()

 Use the hashfile API in the codepath that writes the index file to

* en/ort-perf-batch-11 (2021-05-20) 13 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-05-28 at 58a8b85d6a)

* fc/doc-build-cleanup (2021-05-24) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-05-31 at af103e12f4)
 + doc: avoid using rm directly
 + doc: simplify Makefile using .DELETE_ON_ERROR
 + doc: remove unnecessary rm instances
 + doc: improve asciidoc dependencies
 + doc: refactor common asciidoc dependencies

 Preparatory build procedure clean-up for documentation.


* ga/send-email-sendmail-cmd (2021-05-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-05-22 at 755df67f0e)
 + git-send-email: add option to specify sendmail command

 "git send-email" learned the "--sendmail-cmd" command line option
 and the "sendemail.sendmailCmd" configuration variable, which is a
 more sensible approach than the current way of repurposing the
 "smtp-server" that is meant to name the server to instead name the
 command to talk to the server.


* jk/clone-clean-upon-transport-error (2021-05-19) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-05-22 at 464b1f187c)
 + clone: clean up directory after transport_fetch_refs() failure

 Recent "git clone" left a temporary directory behind when the
 transport layer returned an failure.


* jk/fetch-pack-v2-half-close-early (2021-05-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-05-28 at 56e97ec2df)
 + fetch-pack: signal v2 server that we are done making requests

 "git fetch" over protocol v2 left its side of the socket open after
 it finished speaking, which unnecessarily wasted the resource on
 the other side.


* ps/rev-list-object-type-filter (2021-05-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-05-28 at f22e938f3e)
 + help: fix small typo in error message

 Message update.


* so/log-m-implies-p (2021-05-21) 10 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-05-28 at 2733ec2409)
 + diff-merges: let "-m" imply "-p"
 + diff-merges: rename "combined_imply_patch" to "merges_imply_patch"
 + stash list: stop passing "-m" to "git log"
 + git-svn: stop passing "-m" to "git rev-list"
 + diff-merges: move specific diff-index "-m" handling to diff-index
 + t4013: test "git diff-index -m"
 + t4013: test "git diff-tree -m"
 + t4013: test "git log -m --stat"
 + t4013: test "git log -m --raw"
 + t4013: test that "-m" alone has no effect in "git log"

 The "-m" option in "git log -m" that does not specify which format,
 if any, of diff is desired did not have any visible effect; it now
 implies some form of diff (by default "--patch") is produced.


* zh/ref-filter-atom-type (2021-05-14) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-05-16 at 48fd717185)
 + ref-filter: introduce enum atom_type
 + ref-filter: add objectsize to used_atom
 (this branch is used by zh/ref-filter-raw-data.)

 The code to handle the "--format" option in "for-each-ref" and
 friends made too many string comparisons on %(atom)s used in the
 format string, which has been corrected by converting them into
 enum when the format string is parsed.

 - git-p4: do not decode data from perforce by default
 - git-p4: avoid decoding more data from perforce

 "git p4" in Python-2 days used to accept a lot more kinds of data
