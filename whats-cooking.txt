What's cooking in git.git (Mar 2021, #08; Tue, 30)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'seen' (formerly 'pu'---proposed updates) while commits prefixed
with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

Release tarballs are available at:

 "git commit --fixup=<commit>", which was to tweak the changes made

 did not to fall back to the basic authentication with the
 credential material embedded in the URL after the "Negotiate"
 authentication failed.  Now we do.

  (merged to 'next' on 2021-03-22 at efbda3a7ce)
 + t: annotate !PTHREADS tests with !FAIL_PREREQS

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2021-03-19

 GIT_TEST_FAIL_PREREQS is a mechanism to skip test pieces with
 prerequisites to catch broken tests that depend on the side effects
 of optional pieces, but did not work at all when negative
 prerequisites were involved.

 When "git checkout" removes a path that does not exist in the

  (merged to 'next' on 2021-03-24 at 84079a6e0f)

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2021-03-08

 "git repack" so far has been only capable of repacking everything
 under the sun into a single pack (or split by size).  A cleverer
 strategy to reduce the cost of repacking a repository has been
 introduced.


* tb/push-simple-uses-branch-merge-config (2021-03-13) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-03-22 at bec0a72090)

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* zh/commit-trailer (2021-03-23) 1 commit
 - commit: add --trailer option

 "git commit" learned "--trailer <key>[=<value>]" option; together
 with the interpret-trailers command, this will make it easier to
 support custom trailers.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 area.

 A reroll promised "at some point".

* ds/clarify-hashwrite (2021-03-26) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-03-30 at 701f5c0696)
 + csum-file: make hashwrite() more readable

 The hashwrite() API always resulted in a call to write(2), even
 when writing a small amount of bytes that would still fit in the
 internal buffer held by the hashfile struct.  It has been updated
 to delay the writing until the buffer is filled or the hashfile
 concluded for performance.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 mode of sparse checkout is in use.


* en/ort-perf-batch-10 (2021-03-18) 8 commits
 - diffcore-rename: determine which relevant_sources are no longer relevant

 (this branch is used by en/ort-perf-batch-11 and en/ort-readiness; uses en/ort-perf-batch-9.)

 I made a mistake of picking these up before they got sufficient
 exposure to the reviewers and ended up a source of potential mess
 when it turns out that any of the earlier ones need rewriting (I
 probably should stop picking up nested series that exceeds reviewer
 bandwidth), but how ready is this and subsequent topics?


* mt/add-rm-in-sparse-checkout (2021-03-18) 7 commits
 - rm: honor sparse checkout patterns
 - add: warn when asked to update SKIP_WORKTREE entries
 - refresh_index(): add REFRESH_DONT_MARK_SPARSE_MATCHES flag

 - add: make --chmod and --renormalize honor sparse checkouts
 - t3705: add tests for `git add` in sparse checkouts
 - add: include magic part of pathspec on --refresh error

 "git add" and "git rm" learned not to touch those paths that are
 outside of sparse checkout.

 Expecting a reroll.

 ... we would be much better off to say something like "somebody
 expected X to be a commit, but now somebody else expects it to be a
 blob", which is all that we can reliably say.
