What's cooking in git.git (Feb 2024, #06; Thu, 15)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and
aren't considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL
to a message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity (of course they can be resubmit when new interests
arise).

Git 2.44-rc1 has been tagged.  This round, let's try having just one
release candidate before the final, which is expected to be tagged
on or around 20th.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

 corrected.

 backends of the credential subsystem do.

 + unit-tests: do show relative file paths on non-Windows, too

 The mechanism to report the filename in the source code, used by
 the unit-test machinery, assumed that the compiler expanded __FILE__

 give full path, breaking the output.  This has been corrected.

 The sequencer machinery does not use the ref API and instead
 records names of certain objects it needs for its correct operation
 in temporary files, which makes these objects susceptible to loss
 by garbage collection.  These temporary files have been added as
 starting points for reachability analysis to fix this.

 - Merge branch 'ps/reftable-backend' into kn/for-all-refs
