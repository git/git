What's cooking in git.git (Aug 2014, #02; Fri, 8)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.

The second release candidate snapshot is out.  Hopefully after a
week of a calm pre-release "bugfix-only" period, we can do the 2.1
final late next week.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* ta/doc-config (2014-07-30) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-07-31 at ec577fa)
 + add documentation for writing config files


* tf/maint-doc-push (2014-07-31) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-07-31 at 6a8ef70)
 + git-push: fix link in man page

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* tf/imap-send-create (2014-08-01) 3 commits
 - SQUASH??? varargs form of issue-imap-cmd is no longer used
 - imap-send: create target mailbox if it is missing
 - imap-send: clarify CRAM-MD5 vs LOGIN documentation

 Will merge to 'next' after dealing with the SQUASH??? fix-up.


* bc/archive-pax-header-mode (2014-08-04) 1 commit
 - archive: honor tar.umask even for pax headers

 Implementations of "tar" that do not understand an extended pax
 header would extract the contents of it in a regular file; make
 sure the permission bits of this file follows the same tar.umask
 configuration setting.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* bc/imap-send-doc (2014-08-05) 1 commit
 - imap-send doc: omit confusing "to use imap-send" modifier

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jc/apply-ws-prefix (2014-08-07) 3 commits
 - apply: omit ws check for excluded paths
 - apply: hoist use_patch() helper for path exclusion up
 - apply: use the right attribute for paths in non-Git patches

 Applying a patch not generated by Git in a subdirectory used to
 check the whitespace breakage using the attributes for incorrect
 paths. Also whitespace checks were performed even for paths
 excluded via "git apply --exclude=<path>" mechanism.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/command-line-config-empty-string (2014-08-05) 1 commit
 - config: teach "git -c" to recognize an empty string

 "git -c section.var command" and "git -c section.var= command"
 should pass the configuration differently (the former should be
 a boolean true, the latter should be an empty string).

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/pack-bitmap (2014-08-04) 1 commit
 - pack-bitmap: do not use gcc packed attribute

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/pretty-empty-format (2014-07-30) 3 commits
 - pretty: make empty userformats truly empty
 - pretty: treat "--format=" as an empty userformat
 - revision: drop useless string offset when parsing "--pretty"

 "git log --pretty/format=" with an empty format string did not mean
 the more obvious "No output whatsoever" but "Use default format",
 which was counterintuitive.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 Ejected from 'pu' to unclutter.
 Expecting a reroll.


* bg/rebase-off-of-previous-branch (2014-04-16) 1 commit
 - git-rebase: print name of rev when using shorthand

 Teach "git rebase -" to report the concrete name of the branch
 (i.e. the previous one).

 But it stops short and does not do the same for "git rebase @{-1}".
 Expecting a reroll.


* tr/merge-recursive-index-only (2014-02-05) 3 commits
 - merge-recursive: -Xindex-only to leave worktree unchanged
 - merge-recursive: internal flag to avoid touching the worktree
 - merge-recursive: remove dead conditional in update_stages()

 . log --remerge-diff: show what the conflict resolution changed
 . name-hash: allow dir hashing even when !ignore_case
 . merge-recursive: allow storing conflict hunks in index

 (this branch uses tr/merge-recursive-index-only.)

 "log -p" output learns a new way to let users inspect a merge
 commit by showing the differences between the automerged result
 with conflicts the person who recorded the merge would have seen
 and the final conflict resolution that was recorded in the merge.

 Needs to be rebased, now kb/fast-hashmap topic is in.


* jk/makefile (2014-02-05) 16 commits
 . FIXUP
 . move LESS/LV pager environment to Makefile
 . Makefile: teach scripts to include make variables
 . FIXUP

 . Makefile: use tempfile/mv strategy for GIT-*
 . Makefile: introduce make-var helper function
 . Makefile: fix git-instaweb dependency on gitweb
 . Makefile: drop USE_GETTEXT_SCHEME from GIT-CFLAGS

 Simplify the Makefile rules and macros that exist primarily for
 quoting purposes, and make it easier to robustly express the
 dependency rules.

 Expecting a reroll.


* po/everyday-doc (2014-01-27) 1 commit
 - Make 'git help everyday' work

 This may make the said command to emit something, but the source is
 not meant to be formatted into a manual pages to begin with, and
 also its contents are a bit stale.  It may be a good first step in
 the right direction, but needs more work to at least get the
 mark-up right before public consumption.

 Will hold.


* rb/merge-prepare-commit-msg-hook (2014-01-10) 4 commits
 - merge: drop unused arg from abort_commit method signature
 - merge: make prepare_to_commit responsible for write_merge_state
 - t7505: ensure cleanup after hook blocks merge
 - t7505: add missing &&

 Expose more merge states (e.g. $GIT_DIR/MERGE_MODE) to hooks that
 run during "git merge".  The log message stresses too much on one
 hook, prepare-commit-msg, but it would equally apply to other hooks
 like post-merge, I think.

 Waiting for a reroll.


* jc/graph-post-root-gap (2013-12-30) 3 commits
 - WIP: document what we want at the end
 - graph: remove unused code a bit
 - graph: stuff the current commit into graph->columns[]

 This was primarily a RFH ($gmane/239580).


* tg/perf-lib-test-perf-cleanup (2013-09-19) 2 commits
 - perf-lib: add test_perf_cleanup target
 - perf-lib: split starting the test from the execution

 Add test_perf_cleanup shell function to the perf suite, that allows
 the script writers to define a test with a clean-up action.

 Will hold.


* jc/show-branch (2014-03-24) 5 commits
 - show-branch: use commit slab to represent bitflags of arbitrary width
 - show-branch.c: remove "all_mask"
 - show-branch.c: abstract out "flags" operation
 - show-branch.c: lift all_mask/all_revs to a global static
 - show-branch.c: update comment style

 Waiting for the final step to lift the hard-limit before sending it out.

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* jk/stash-list-p (2014-08-07) 1 commit
 - stash: default listing to working-tree diff

 Teach "git stash list -p" to show the difference between the base
 commit version and the working tree version, which is in line with
 what "git show" gives.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* pr/remotes-in-hashmap (2014-07-30) 1 commit
 - use a hashmap to make remotes faster

 Optimize remotes configuration look-up in a repository with very
 many remotes defined.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 - refs.c: make the *_packed_refs functions static
 - refs.c: make repack_without_refs static
 - remote.c: use a transaction for deleting refs
 - refs.c: write updates to packed refs when a transaction has more than one ref
 - refs.c: move reflog updates into its own function
 (this branch uses rs/ref-transaction, rs/ref-transaction-1, rs/ref-transaction-reflog and rs/ref-transaction-rename.)

 Follow-up on rs/ref-transaction series to use the packed-ref to
 achieve atomicity when multiple refs are involved.

 No more nitpicks and better design suggestions?


* rs/ref-transaction-rename (2014-07-31) 5 commits
 - refs.c: rollback the lockfile before we die() in repack_without_refs
 - refs.c: update rename_ref to use a transaction
 - refs.c: use packed refs when deleting refs during a transaction
 - refs.c: return error instead of dying when locking fails during transaction
 - refs.c: allow passing raw git_committer_info as email to _update_reflog
 (this branch is used by rs/ref-transaction-multi; uses rs/ref-transaction, rs/ref-transaction-1 and rs/ref-transaction-reflog.)

 Follow-up on rs/ref-transaction series to make renaming a ref
 transactional (i.e. "delete old and create new" should not leave
 an in-between state behind when it fails).

 No more nitpicks and better design suggestions?


* nd/lock-paths-absolute (2014-08-01) 3 commits
 - lockfile.c: store absolute path
 - lockfile.c: remove PATH_MAX limit in resolve_symlink()
 - lockfile.c: remove PATH_MAX limitation (except in resolve_symlink)

* mm/config-message-i18n (2014-08-01) 1 commit
 - config.c: mark error and warnings strings for translation

 Will discard (now at the bottom of ta/config-set-1 topic).


* mm/config-edit-global (2014-07-25) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-07-31 at ecce1c7)
 + commit: advertise config --global --edit on guessed identity
 + home_config_paths(): let the caller ignore xdg path
 + config --global --edit: create a template file if needed

 Start "git config --edit --global" from a skeletal per-user
 configuration file contents, instead of a total blank, when the
 user does not already have any.  This immediately reduces the need
 for a later "Have you forgotten setting core.user?" and we can add
 more to the template as we gain more experience.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* rs/init-no-duplicate-real-path (2014-07-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-07-31 at 683112e)

 - refs.c: make ref_transaction_create a wrapper to ref_transaction_update
 (this branch is used by rs/ref-transaction-multi and rs/ref-transaction-rename; uses rs/ref-transaction and rs/ref-transaction-1.)

 Cover updates to reflog with the same transaction mechanism as used
 for reflog manipulations.

 No more nitpicks and better design suggestions?


* cb/mergetool-difftool (2014-07-21) 2 commits
 - difftool: don't assume that default sh is sane
 - mergetool: don't require a work tree for --tool-help

 Update the way the "difftool --help" shows the help message that is
 shared with the "mergetool" to reduce one shell dependency.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* rs/strbuf-getcwd (2014-07-29) 10 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-07-31 at 6edc3bc)

 Will cook in 'next'.


* jc/not-mingw-cygwin (2014-07-21) 2 commits
 - test prerequisites: enumerate with commas
 - test prerequisites: eradicate NOT_FOO

 We have been using NOT_{MINGW,CYGWIN} test prerequisites long
 before Peff invented support for negated prerequisites e.g. !MINGW
 and we still add more uses of the former.  Convert them to the
 latter to avoid confusion.


* ta/config-set (2014-07-29) 2 commits
 - test-config: add tests for the config_set API
 - add `config_set` API for caching config-like files
 (this branch is used by ta/config-set-1 and ta/config-set-2.)

 Add in-core caching layer to let us avoid reading the same
 configuration files number of times.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 - refs.c: change ref_transaction_create to do error checking and return status
 (this branch is used by rs/ref-transaction, rs/ref-transaction-multi, rs/ref-transaction-reflog and rs/ref-transaction-rename.)

 The second batch of the transactional ref update series.

 No more nitpicks and better design suggestions?

 - patch-id: change default to stable

 Teaches "git patch-id" to compute the patch ID that does not change

 is backward incompatible, the last bit to flip it to be the default
 is left out of 'master' for now.

 Will hold.
