What's cooking in git.git (Dec 2011, #03; Fri, 9)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with '+' are in
'next'.

Two of the more important topics slated for 1.7.9 have been merged to
'master'. Let's hope the other ones also will stabilize soonish, so that
we can smoothly close this cycle early.

Here are the repositories that have my integration branches:

With maint, master, next, pu, todo:

        git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git
        git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git
        https://code.google.com/p/git-core/
        https://github.com/git/git

With only maint and master:

        git://git.sourceforge.jp/gitroot/git-core/git.git
        git://git-core.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/git-core/git-core

With all the topics and integration branches:

The preformatted documentation in HTML and man format are found in:

[Graduated to "master"]

* ab/pull-rebase-config (2011-11-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-12-05 at 6d235a4)
 + pull: introduce a pull.rebase option to enable --rebase

* jc/pull-signed-tag (2011-11-12) 15 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-12-05 at c949bd1)
 + commit-tree: teach -m/-F options to read logs from elsewhere
 + commit-tree: update the command line parsing
 + commit: teach --amend to carry forward extra headers
 + merge: force edit and no-ff mode when merging a tag object
 + commit: copy merged signed tags to headers of merge commit
 + merge: record tag objects without peeling in MERGE_HEAD
 + merge: make usage of commit->util more extensible
 + fmt-merge-msg: Add contents of merged tag in the merge message
 + fmt-merge-msg: package options into a structure
 + fmt-merge-msg: avoid early returns
 + refs DWIMmery: use the same rule for both "git fetch" and others
 + fetch: allow "git fetch $there v1.0" to fetch a tag
 + merge: notice local merging of tags and keep it unwrapped
 + fetch: do not store peeled tag object names in FETCH_HEAD
 + Split GPG interface into its own helper library
 (this branch is used by jc/signed-commit.)

Allow pulling/merging a signed tag instead of a branch tip, and record
the GPG signature in the merge commit for later audit.

* jc/request-pull-show-head-4 (2011-11-09) 12 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-12-05 at 8f05b45)
 + request-pull: use the annotated tag contents
 + fmt-merge-msg.c: Fix an "dubious one-bit signed bitfield" sparse error
 + environment.c: Fix an sparse "symbol not declared" warning
 + builtin/log.c: Fix an "Using plain integer as NULL pointer" warning
 + fmt-merge-msg: use branch.$name.description
 + request-pull: use the branch description
 + request-pull: state what commit to expect
 + request-pull: modernize style
 + branch: teach --edit-description option
 + format-patch: use branch description in cover letter
 + branch: add read_branch_desc() helper function
 + Merge branch 'bk/ancestry-path' into jc/branch-desc

Allow setting "description" for branches and use it to help communications
between humans in various workflow elements. It also allows requesting for
a signed tag to be pulled and shows the tag message in the generated message.

needs to learn it to be used remotely.

Teaches "git add" to send large-ish blob data straight to a packfile.
This is a continuation to the "large file support" topic. The codepath to
move data from worktree to repository is made aware of streaming, just
like the checkout codepath that goes the other way, which was done in the
previous "large file support" topic in the 1.7.7 cycle.

* jn/gitweb-side-by-side-diff (2011-10-31) 8 commits

 - t9500: Add test for handling incomplete lines in diff by gitweb
 - gitweb: Give side-by-side diff extra CSS styling
 - gitweb: Add a feature to show side-by-side diff
 - gitweb: Extract formatting of diff chunk header
 - gitweb: Refactor diff body line classification

Replaces a series from Kato Kazuyoshi on the same topic.
Is this ready for 'next'?
