What's cooking in git.git (Oct 2020, #03; Mon, 19)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'seen' (formerly 'pu'---proposed updates) while commits prefixed
with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

Git 2.29 final has been tagged.  We will hopefully either (1) not
see brown-paper-bag breakages at all, or (2) will see some but can
immediately deal with them, in coming couple of days.  After that,
the 2.30 cycle will gain steam, starting next week.  Let's see.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into.  Some repositories have
only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

Release tarballs are available at:

* en/strmap (2020-10-13) 10 commits
 - strmap: enable allocations to come from a mem_pool
 - strmap: add a strset sub-type

* en/test-selector (2020-10-18) 3 commits
 - test-lib: reduce verbosity of skipped tests

 - test-lib: allow selecting tests by substring/glob with --run

 Our test scripts can be told to run only individual pieces while
 skipping others with the "--run=..." option; they were taught to
 take a substring of test title, in addition to numbers, to name the
 test pices to run.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/report-fn-typedef (2020-10-16) 1 commit
 - usage: define a type for a reporting function

 Code clean-up.

 Needs to get its log message updated.


* mr/bisect-in-c-3 (2020-10-16) 7 commits
 - bisect--helper: retire `--bisect-autostart` subcommand

  (merged to 'next' on 2020-10-15 at cb1029e046)
 + Makefile: remove the unused variable TAR_DIST_EXTRA_OPTS
 + Makefile: use git init/add/commit/archive for dist-doc

 Use "git archive" more to produce the release tarball.

  (merged to 'next' on 2020-10-15 at a0df4a45cb)
 + line-log: handle deref_tag() returning NULL

* rs/worktree-list-show-locked (2020-10-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-10-15 at 3917e61c28)
 + worktree: teach `list` to annotate locked worktree

 "git worktree list" now shows if each worktree is locked.  This
 possibly may open us to show other kinds of states in the future.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* sc/sequencer-gpg-octopus (2020-10-18) 3 commits
 - t3435: add tests for rebase -r GPG signing
 - sequencer: pass explicit --no-gpg-sign to merge
 - sequencer: fix gpg option passed to merge subcommand

 "git rebase --rebase-merges" did not correctly pass --gpg-sign
 command line option to underying "git merge" when replaying a merge
 using non-default merge strategy or when replaying an octopus merge
 (because replaying a two-head merge with the default strategy was
 done in a separate codepath, the problem did not trigger for most
 users), which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sm/curl-retry (2020-10-13) 3 commits
 - http: automatically retry some requests
 - replace CURLOPT_FILE With CURLOPT_WRITEDATA
 - remote-curl: add testing for intelligent retry for HTTP

 may reasonably be retried.

 Need to pick up reroll.

 Work around flakiness in a test.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* es/test-cmp-typocatcher (2020-10-16) 1 commit
 - Revert "test_cmp: diagnose incorrect arguments"

 A test helper "test_cmp A B" was taught to diagnose missing files A
 or B as a bug in test, but some tests legitimately wanted to notice
 a failure to even create file B as an error, in addition to leaving
 the expected result in it, and were misdiagnosed as a bug.  This
 has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 The first step to remove on-disk binaries for built-in subcommands
 by soliciting objections.

 On hold for now.


* dr/push-remoteref-fix (2020-04-23) 1 commit
 - remote.c: fix handling of %(push:remoteref)

 The "%(push:remoteref)" placeholder in the "--format=" argument of
 "git format-patch" (and friends) only showed what got explicitly
 configured, not what ref at the receiving end would be updated when
 "git push" was used, as it ignored the default behaviour (e.g. update
 the same ref as the source).

 Discard for now.

 + add-patch: add NEEDSWORK about comparing commits
 + Doc: document "A...B" form for <tree-ish> in checkout and switch

 commits A and B.

* dl/resurrect-update-for-sha256 (2020-10-08) 2 commits
 - contrib/git-resurrect.sh: use hash-agnostic OID pattern

 - commit-graph: don't write commit-graph when disabled

 once while it is merging the layers, it used to die.  The code now
 ignores all but one of them and continues.

 Expecting a reroll.

 tip of the remote ref that is about to be force-replaced.
