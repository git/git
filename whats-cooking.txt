What's cooking in git.git (Nov 2013, #05; Thu, 21)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.

Hopefully 1.8.5-rc3 that was tagged on Wednesday will be the final
release candidate for this cycle.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* nd/liteal-pathspecs (2013-10-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-11-01 at 1a91775)
 + pathspec: stop --*-pathspecs impact on internal parse_pathspec() uses

 Fixes a regression on 'master' since v1.8.4.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* jj/doc-markup-hints-in-coding-guidelines (2013-11-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-11-21 at 9c638a6)
 + State correct usage of literal examples in man pages in the coding standards

 Can wait in 'next'.


* jn/perl-lib-extra (2013-11-18) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-11-20 at 8c90afae)
 + Makefile: add PERLLIB_EXTRA variable that adds to default perl path
 + Makefile: rebuild perl scripts when perl paths change


* jj/doc-markup-gitcli (2013-11-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-11-21 at 5e49fa8)
 + Documentation/gitcli.txt: fix double quotes

 Can wait in 'next'.


* jk/remove-experimental-loose-object-support (2013-11-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-11-21 at d37bab7)
 + drop support for "experimental" loose objects

 Can wait in 'next'.


* jl/commit-v-strip-marker (2013-11-19) 1 commit
 - commit -v: strip diffs and submodule shortlogs from the commit message

 Perhaps another reroll for core.commentChar coming?


* nd/glossary-content-pathspec-markup (2013-11-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-11-21 at 6072636)
 + glossary-content.txt: fix documentation of "**" patterns

[Stalled]

* fc/transport-helper-fixes (2013-11-13) 12 commits
 - remote-bzr: support the new 'force' option
 - transport-helper: add support to delete branches
 - fast-export: add support to delete refs
 - fast-import: add support to delete refs
 - transport-helper: add support for old:new refspec
 - fast-export: add new --refspec option
 - fast-export: improve argument parsing
 - test-hg.sh: tests are now expected to pass
 - transport-helper: check for 'forced update' message
 - transport-helper: add 'force' to 'export' helpers
 - transport-helper: don't update refs in dry-run
 - transport-helper: mismerge fix

 Updates transport-helper, fast-import and fast-export to allow the
 ref mapping and ref deletion in a way similar to the natively
 supported transports.

 The option name "--refspec" needs to be rethought. It does not mean
 what refspec usually means, even though it shares the same syntax
 with refspec; calling it --refspec only because it shares the same
 syntax is like calling it --asciistring and does not make sense.


* nv/commit-gpgsign-config (2013-11-06) 1 commit
 - Add the commit.gpgsign option to sign all commits

 Introduce commit.gpgsign configuration variable to force every
 commit to be GPG signed.

 Needs tests, perhaps?


* tb/clone-ssh-with-colon-for-port (2013-11-04) 1 commit
 . git clone: is an URL local or ssh

 Still being reworked.


* cn/thin-push-capability (2013-11-06) 2 commits
 - send-pack: only send a thin pack if the server supports it
 - receive-pack: advertise thin-pack

 Peff had a good suggestion to control this by expressing what the
 receiving end wants in a more direct way, namely to advertise a
 'no-thin' trait in the capability list, which seems to be favored
 by Shawn, too.


* jt/commit-fixes-footer (2013-10-30) 1 commit
 - commit: Add -f, --fixes <commit> option to add Fixes: line

 There is an ongoing discussion around this topic; in general I am
 fairly negative on a new feature that is too narrow and prefer a
 more generic solution that can be tailored for specific needs, as
 many people stated in the thread.

 It appears that the discussion stalled.


* np/pack-v4 (2013-09-18) 90 commits
 . packv4-parse.c: add tree offset caching
 . t1050: replace one instance of show-index with verify-pack
 . index-pack, pack-objects: allow creating .idx v2 with .pack v4
 . unpack-objects: decode v4 trees
 . unpack-objects: allow to save processed bytes to a buffer
 - ...

 Nico and Duy advancing the eternal vaporware pack-v4.  This is here
 primarily for wider distribution of the preview edition.

 Temporarily ejected from 'pu', to try out jk/pack-bitmap, which
 this topic conflicts with.


* jk/pack-bitmap (2013-11-18) 22 commits
 - compat/mingw.h: Fix the MinGW and msvc builds
 - pack-bitmap: implement optional name_hash cache
 - t/perf: add tests for pack bitmaps
 - t: add basic bitmap functionality tests
 - count-objects: recognize .bitmap in garbage-checking
 - repack: consider bitmaps when performing repacks
 - repack: handle optional files created by pack-objects
 - repack: turn exts array into array-of-struct
 - repack: stop using magic number for ARRAY_SIZE(exts)
 - pack-objects: implement bitmap writing
 - rev-list: add bitmap mode to speed up object lists
 - pack-objects: use bitmaps when packing objects
 - pack-bitmap: add support for bitmap indexes
 - documentation: add documentation for the bitmap format
 - ewah: compressed bitmap implementation
 - compat: add endianness helpers
 - sha1_file: export `git_open_noatime`
 - revision: allow setting custom limiter function
 - pack-objects: factor out name_hash
 - pack-objects: refactor the packing list
 - revindex: export new APIs
 - sha1write: make buffer const-correct

 Borrows the bitmap index into packfiles from JGit to speed up
 enumeration of objects involved in a commit range without having to
 fully traverse the history.


* mf/graph-show-root (2013-10-25) 1 commit
 . graph.c: mark root commit differently

 In a repository with multiple-roots, "log --graph", especially with
 "--oneline", does not give the reader enough visual cue to see
 where one line of history ended and a separate history began.

 This is the version that marks the roots 'x' when they would have
 been marked as '*'; Keshav Kini suggested an alternative of giving
 an extra blank line after every root, which I tend to think is a
 better approach to the problem.


* tg/perf-lib-test-perf-cleanup (2013-09-19) 2 commits
 - perf-lib: add test_perf_cleanup target
 - perf-lib: split starting the test from the execution

 Add test_perf_cleanup shell function to the perf suite, that allows
 the script writers to define a test with a clean-up action.

 Holding until needed.


* yt/shortened-rename (2013-10-18) 2 commits
 - SQUASH??? style fixes and s/omit/shorten/ where appropriate
 - diff.c: keep arrow(=>) on show_stats()'s shortened filename part to make rename visible

 Attempts to give more weight on the fact that a filepair represents
 a rename than showing substring of the actual path when diffstat
 lines are not wide enough.

 I am not sure if that is solving a right problem, though.


* rv/send-email-cache-generated-mid (2013-08-21) 2 commits
 - git-send-email: Cache generated message-ids, use them when prompting
 - git-send-email: add optional 'choices' parameter to the ask sub


* rj/read-default-config-in-show-ref-pack-refs (2013-06-17) 3 commits
 - ### DONTMERGE: needs better explanation on what config they need
 - pack-refs.c: Add missing call to git_config()
 - show-ref.c: Add missing call to git_config()

 The changes themselves are probably good, but it is unclear what
 basic setting needs to be read for which exact operation.

 Waiting for clarification.
 $gmane/228294


* jc/format-patch (2013-04-22) 2 commits
 - format-patch: --inline-single
 - format-patch: rename "no_inline" field

 A new option to send a single patch to the standard output to be
 appended at the bottom of a message.  I personally have no need for
 this, but it was easy enough to cobble together.  Tests, docs and
 stripping out more MIMEy stuff are left as exercises to interested
 parties.


* jk/gitweb-utf8 (2013-04-08) 4 commits
 - gitweb: Fix broken blob action parameters on blob/commitdiff pages
 - gitweb: Don't append ';js=(0|1)' to external links
 - gitweb: Make feed title valid utf8
 - gitweb: Fix utf8 encoding for blob_plain, blobdiff_plain, commitdiff_plain, and patch

 Various fixes to gitweb.

 Drew Northup volunteered to take a look into this.
 $gmane/226216


* jc/show-branch (2013-06-07) 5 commits
 - show-branch: use commit slab to represent bitflags of arbitrary width
 - show-branch.c: remove "all_mask"
 - show-branch.c: abstract out "flags" operation
 - show-branch.c: lift all_mask/all_revs to a global static
 - show-branch.c: update comment style

 Waiting for the final step to lift the hard-limit before sending it out.

 + rev-list --exclude: export add/clear-ref-exclusion and ref-excluded API
 + rev-list --exclude: tests

 People often wished a way to tell "git log --branches" (and "git
 log --remotes --not --branches") to exclude some local branches
 from the expansion of "--branches" (similarly for "--tags", "--all"
 and "--glob=<pattern>").  Now they have one.

* th/reflog-annotated-tag (2013-10-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-11-01 at 8b154cc)
 + reflog: handle lightweight and annotated tags equally

 "git log -g $annotated_tag", when there is no reflog history, should
 have produced a single output entry (i.e. the ref creation event),
 but instead showed the history leading to the tag.

 Broken at the design level.  Any reflog entry that points at a non
 commit needs to be handled with new code that does not exist yet,
 and lifting the "this code handles only commits" without adding
 such code does not solve anything.

 Will discard.


* tr/merge-recursive-index-only (2013-10-28) 3 commits
 - merge-recursive: -Xindex-only to leave worktree unchanged
 - merge-recursive: internal flag to avoid touching the worktree

 + get_expanded_map(): avoid memory leak
 + get_expanded_map(): add docstring
 + builtin/fetch.c: reorder function definitions

 + api-remote.txt: correct section "struct refspec"
 + t5510: check that "git fetch --prune --tags" does not prune branches
 + t5510: prepare test refs more straightforwardly
 + t5510: use the correct tag name in test

 The "-tags" option to "git fetch" used to be literally a synonym to
 a "refs/tags/*:refs/tags/*" refspec, which meant that (1) as an
 explicit refspec given from the command line, it silenced the lazy
 "git fetch" default that is configured, and (2) also as an explicit
 refspec given from the command line, it interacted with "--prune"
 to remove any tag that the remote we are fetching from does not
 have.

 This demotes it to an option; with it, we fetch all tags in
 addition to what would be fetched without the option, and it does
 not interact with the decision "--prune" makes to see what
 remote-tracking refs the local has are missing the remote
 counterpart.

* ak/submodule-foreach-quoting (2013-09-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-10-14 at d77c5f1)
 + submodule foreach: skip eval for more than one argument

 A behavior change, but a worthwhile one: "git submodule foreach"
 was treating its arguments as part of a single command to be
 concatenated and passed to a shell, making writing buggy
 scripts too easy.

 This patch preserves the old "just pass it to the shell" behavior
 when a single argument is passed to 'git submodule foreach' and
 moves to a new "skip the shell and use the arguments passed
 unmolested" behavior when more than one argument is passed.

 The old behavior (always concatenating and passing to the shell)
 was similar to the 'ssh' command, while the new behavior (switching
 on the number of arguments) is what 'xterm -e' does.

 May need more thought to make sure this change is advertised well
 so that scripts that used multiple arguments but added their own
 extra layer of quoting are not broken.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* kb/fast-hashmap (2013-11-18) 14 commits
 - read-cache.c: fix memory leaks caused by removed cache entries

 - fix 'git update-index --verbose --again' output
 - remove old hash.[ch] implementation
 - name-hash.c: remove cache entries instead of marking them CE_UNHASHED

 - name-hash.c: remove unreferenced directory entries
 - name-hash.c: use new hash map implementation for directories
 - diffcore-rename.c: use new hash map implementation
 - diffcore-rename.c: simplify finding exact renames
 - diffcore-rename.c: move code around to prepare for the next patch
 - buitin/describe.c: use new hash map implementation
 - add a hashtable implementation that supports O(1) removal
 - submodule: don't access the .gitmodules cache entry after removing it

 Improvements to our hash table to get it to meet the needs of the
 msysgit fscache project, with some nice performance improvements.

 The preparatory clean-up to submodule from Jens is at the bottom. I
 also squashed in a fix-up by Karsten found at $gmane/236468 (please
 double-check the result).
