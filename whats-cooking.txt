What's cooking in git.git (Jun 2017, #03; Mon, 5)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

With many fixes accumulated since v2.13.0, the first maintenance
release v2.13.1 has been tagged.  Thanks for all the help.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

[Graduated to "master"]

* ab/c-translators-comment-style (2017-05-31) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-06-01 at df7fb9199a)
 + C style: use standard style for "TRANSLATORS" comments

 Update the C style recommendation for notes for translators, as
 recent versions of gettext tools can work with our style of
 multi-line comments.


* ab/sha1dc-maint (2017-05-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-05-30 at 9eb40bf912)
 + sha1dc: update from upstream
 (this branch is used by ab/sha1dc.)

 The "collision detecting" SHA-1 implementation shipped with 2.13
 was quite broken on some big-endian platforms and/or platforms that
 do not like unaligned fetches.  Update to the upstream code which
 has already fixed these issues.


* ab/t3070-test-dedup (2017-05-29) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-05-30 at 71eadec33b)

 Doc update.


* jh/close-index-before-stat (2017-04-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-05-16 at 0c0372eb02)
 + read-cache: close index.lock in do_write_index

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2017-04-30

 The timestamp of the index file is now taken after the file is
 closed, to help Windows, on which a stale timestamp is reported by
 fstat() on a file that is opened for writing and data was written
 but not yet closed.


* jk/connect-symref-info-leak-fix (2017-05-26) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-05-30 at d8b75d2dd9)

  (merged to 'next' on 2017-06-01 at ee2233d409)
 + am: handle "-h" argument earlier
 (this branch is used by jk/consistent-h.)

 "git am -h" triggered a BUG().


* jk/url-insteadof-config (2017-06-01) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-06-01 at e7ea6032c2)
 + docs/config: mention protocol implications of url.insteadOf

 The interaction of "url.*.insteadOf" and custom URL scheme's
 whitelisting is now documented better.


* js/blame-lib (2017-05-25) 29 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-05-30 at b4678b36a7)

 + blame: remove unneeded dependency on blob.h

 The internal logic used in "git blame" has been libified to make it
 easier to use by cgit.


* mb/diff-default-to-indent-heuristics (2017-05-09) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-05-29 at 7645575e21)
 + add--interactive: drop diff.indentHeuristic handling
 + diff: enable indent heuristic by default
 + diff: have the diff-* builtins configure diff before initializing revisions
 + diff: make the indent heuristic part of diff's basic configuration

 Make the "indent" heuristics the default in "diff" and diff.indentHeuristics
 configuration variable an escape hatch for those who do no want it.
 Looks like there may be follow-on work possible, but the topic
 itself is in good order.

 Test fix.


* tb/pull-ff-rebase-autostash (2017-06-01) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-06-01 at b5e676d57e)
 + pull: ff --rebase --autostash works in dirty repo

 "git pull --rebase --autostash" didn't auto-stash when the local history
 fast-forwards to the upstream.

* rs/strbuf-addftime-zZ (2017-06-04) 1 commit
 - strbuf: let strbuf_addftime handle %z and %Z itself

 As there is no portable way to pass timezone information to
 strftime, some output format from "git log" and friends are
 impossible to produce.  Teach our own strbuf_addftime to replace %z
 and %Z with caller-supplied values to help working around this.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 - revision.c: use skip_prefix() in handle_revision_pseudo_opt()
 - revision.c: use skip_prefix() in handle_revision_opt()
 - revision.c: stricter parsing of '--no-{min,max}-parents'

 Code clean-up.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ab/perf-remove-index-lock (2017-06-05) 1 commit
 - perf: work around the tested repo having an index.lock

 When an existing repository is used for t/perf testing, we first
 create bit-for-bit copy of it, which may grab a transient state of
 the repository and freeze it into the repository used for testing,
 which then may cause Git operations to fail.  Single out "the index
 being locked" case and forcibly drop the lock from the copy.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ab/wip-fsmonitor (2017-06-04) 7 commits
 - perf: add a performance test for core.fsmonitor
 - fsmonitor: add a sample query-fsmonitor hook script for Watchman
 - fsmonitor: add documentation for the fsmonitor extension
 - fsmonitor: add test cases for fsmonitor extension
 - fsmonitor: teach git to optionally utilize a file system monitor to speed up detecting new or changed files.
 - dir: make lookup_untracked() available outside of dir.c
 - bswap: add 64 bit endianness helper get_be64

* mg/status-in-progress-info (2017-05-10) 2 commits
 - status --short --inprogress: spell it as --in-progress
 - status: show in-progress info for short status

 "git status" learns an option to report various operations
 (e.g. "merging") that the user is in the middle of.

 cf. <xmqqmvakcdqw.fsf@gitster.mtv.corp.google.com>


* mg/name-rev-debug (2017-03-31) 2 commits
 - describe: pass --debug down to name-rev
 - name-rev: provide debug output

 "git describe --debug --contains" did not add any meaningful
 information, even though without "--contains" it did.

 Will discard for now.

 - worktree move: refuse to move worktrees with submodules
 - worktree move: accept destination as directory
 - worktree move: new command
 - worktree.c: add update_worktree_location()
 - worktree.c: add validate_worktree()

* sk/dash-is-previous (2017-03-01) 5 commits
 . revert.c: delegate handling of "-" shorthand to setup_revisions
 . sha1_name.c: teach get_sha1_1 "-" shorthand for "@{-1}"
 . revision.c: args starting with "-" might be a revision
 . revision.c: swap if/else blocks
 . revision.c: do not update argv with unknown option

 A dash "-" can be written to mean "the branch that was previously
 checked out" in more places.

 Ejected, as it seems that making -.. to mean @{-1}..HEAD etc. are
 going too far.

* jc/diff-tree-stale-comment (2017-06-02) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-06-04 at bffae281d2)
 + diff-tree: update stale in-code comments

 Comment fix.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/noent-notdir (2017-05-30) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-06-04 at 7cb4efbc3c)
 + treewide: use is_missing_file_error() where ENOENT and ENOTDIR are checked
 + compat-util: is_missing_file_error()

 Our code often opens a path to an optional file, to work on its
 contents when we can successfully open it.  We can ignore a failure
 to open if such an optional file does not exist, but we do want to
 report a failure in opening for other reasons (e.g. we got an I/O
 error, or the file is there, but we lack the permission to open).

 The exact errors we need to ignore are ENOENT (obviously) and
 ENOTDIR (less obvious).  Instead of repeating comparison of errno
 with these two constants, introduce a helper function to do so.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* rf/completion (2017-06-02) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-06-04 at dde1e34703)

* ls/filter-process-delayed (2017-06-01) 5 commits
 - convert: add "status=delayed" to filter process protocol
 - convert: move multiple file filter error handling to separate function
 - t0021: write "OUT" only on success
 - t0021: make debug log file name configurable
 - t0021: keep filter log files on comparison

 The filter-process interface learned to allow a process with long
 latency give a "delayed" response.

 Needs review.


* jk/consistent-h (2017-06-05) 8 commits
 - t0012: test "-h" with builtins
 - git: add hidden --list-builtins option
 - version: convert to parse-options
 - diff- and log- family: handle "git cmd -h" early
 - submodule--helper: show usage for "-h"
 - remote-{ext,fd}: print usage message on invalid arguments
 - upload-archive: handle "-h" option early
 - credential: handle invalid arguments earlier

 "git $cmd -h" for builtin commands calls the implementation of the
 command (i.e. cmd_$cmd() function) without doing any repository
 set-up, and the commands that expect RUN_SETUP is done by the Git
 potty needs to be prepared to show the help text without barfing.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* pw/rebase-i-regression-fix-tests (2017-06-01) 1 commit
 - rebase -i: add test for reflog message

 Just the first one of three? new tests that follows up a regression
 fix.

 Expecting a portable update.


* sb/submodule-blanket-recursive (2017-06-01) 9 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-06-04 at 418bb03032)
 + builtin/fetch.c: respect 'submodule.recurse' option
 + builtin/push.c: respect 'submodule.recurse' option
 + builtin/grep.c: respect 'submodule.recurse' option
 + Introduce 'submodule.recurse' option for worktree manipulators
 + submodule loading: separate code path for .gitmodules and config overlay
 + reset/checkout/read-tree: unify config callback for submodule recursion
 + submodule test invocation: only pass additional arguments
 + submodule recursing: do not write a config variable twice
 + Merge branch 'ab/grep-preparatory-cleanup' into sb/submodule-blanket-recursive

 Many commands learned to pay attention to submodule.recurse
 configuration.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 It is not known if a simple "yes/no" is sufficient in the longer
 term, and what should happen when --recurse-submodules option starts
 taking "recurse into them how?" parameter, though.


* ab/pcre-v2 (2017-06-02) 8 commits
 - grep: add support for PCRE v2
 - grep: un-break building with PCRE >= 8.32 without --enable-jit
 - grep: un-break building with PCRE < 8.20
 - grep: un-break building with PCRE < 8.32
 - grep: add support for the PCRE v1 JIT API
 - log: add -P as a synonym for --perl-regexp
 - grep: skip pthreads overhead when using one thread
 - grep: don't redundantly compile throwaway patterns under threading

 Update "perl-compatible regular expression" support to enable JIT
 and also allow linking with the newer PCRE v2 library.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/pathspec-magic-disambiguation (2017-05-29) 6 commits
 - verify_filename(): flip order of checks
 - verify_filename(): treat ":(magic)" as a pathspec
 - check_filename(): handle ":^" path magic
 - check_filename(): use skip_prefix
 - check_filename(): refactor ":/" handling
 - t4208: add check for ":/" without matching file

 The convention for a command line is to follow "git cmdname
 --options" with revisions followed by an optional "--"
 disambiguator and then finally pathspecs.  When "--" is not there,
 we make sure early ones are all interpretable as revs (and do not
 look like paths) and later ones are the other way around.  A
 pathspec with "magic" (e.g. ":/p/a/t/h" that matches p/a/t/h from
 the top-level of the working tree, no matter what subdirectory you
 are working from) are conservatively judged as "not a path", which
 required disambiguation more often.  The command line parser
 learned to say "it's a pathspec" a bit more often when the syntax
 looks like so.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ab/sha1dc (2017-05-22) 2 commits
 - sha1collisiondetection: automatically enable when submodule is populated
 - sha1dc: optionally use sha1collisiondetection as a submodule

 The "collission-detecting" implementation of SHA-1 hash we borrowed
 from is replaced by directly binding the upstream project as our
 submodule.

 Will keep in 'pu' for a few CI cycles.
 Impact to the various build and release infrastructure of using
 submodule is not yet fully known, but this lets us dip our toes.


* bp/fsmonitor (2017-06-04) 7 commits
 - perf: add a performance test for core.fsmonitor
 - fsmonitor: add a sample query-fsmonitor hook script for Watchman
 - fsmonitor: add documentation for the fsmonitor extension
 - fsmonitor: add test cases for fsmonitor extension
 - fsmonitor: teach git to optionally utilize a file system monitor to speed up detecting new or changed files.
 - dir: make lookup_untracked() available outside of dir.c
 - bswap: add 64 bit endianness helper get_be64

 We learned to talk to watchman to speed up "git status".

* sb/diff-color-move (2017-06-01) 17 commits

 - diff.c: convert diff_summary to use emit_line_*
 - diff.c: convert diff_flush to use emit_line_*

 - diff: introduce more flexible emit function
 - diff.c: factor out diff_flush_patch_all_file_pairs
 - diff: move line ending check into emit_hunk_header
 - diff: readability fix

 "git diff" has been taught to optionally paint new lines that are
 the same as deleted lines elsewhere differently from genuinely new
 lines.

 Are we happy with these changes?


* xz/send-email-batch-size (2017-05-23) 1 commit
 - send-email: --batch-size to work around some SMTP server limit

 "git send-email" learned to overcome some SMTP server limitation
 that does not allow many pieces of e-mails to be sent over a single
 session.

* sg/clone-refspec-from-command-line-config (2017-06-01) 2 commits
 - Documentation/clone: document ignored configuration variables
 - clone: respect additional configured fetch refspecs during initial fetch

 "git clone -c var=val" is a way to set configuration variables in
 the resulting repository, but it is more useful to also make these
 variables take effect while the initial clone is happening,
 e.g. these configuration variables could be fetch refspecs.

 Are we happy with these two?


* nd/fopen-errors (2017-06-02) 13 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-06-04 at 7a755e73bb)
 + mingw_fopen: report ENOENT for invalid file names
 + mingw: verify that paths are not mistaken for remote nicknames
 + log: fix memory leak in open_next_file()
 + rerere.c: move error_errno() closer to the source system call
 + print errno when reporting a system call error
 + wrapper.c: make warn_on_inaccessible() static
 + wrapper.c: add and use fopen_or_warn()
 + wrapper.c: add and use warn_on_fopen_errors()
 + config.mak.uname: set FREAD_READS_DIRECTORIES for Darwin, too
 + config.mak.uname: set FREAD_READS_DIRECTORIES for Linux and FreeBSD
 + clone: use xfopen() instead of fopen()
 + use xfopen() in more places
 + git_fopen: fix a sparse 'not declared' warning

 We often try to open a file for reading whose existence is
 optional, and silently ignore errors from open/fopen; report such
 errors if they are not due to missing files.

 - rebase -i: generate the script via rebase--helper
 - t3415: verify that an empty instructionFormat is handled as before

 The final batch to "git rebase -i" updates to move more code from
 the shell script to C.

 "git gc" and friends when multiple worktrees are used off of a
