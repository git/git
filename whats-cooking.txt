What's cooking in git.git (Oct 2015, #05; Thu, 22)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.

With somewhat reduced review bandwidth, I'd expect that the upcoming
cycle would be slower than usual.  At tinyurl.com/gitCal, I
tentatively drew a 14-week schedule for this cycle (I plan to be
offline during weeks #7-#9 myself---hopefully we'll have capable
interim maintainers to take care of the list traffic in the meantime
as in past years).

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

[New Topics]

* ar/clone-dissociate (2015-10-22) 1 commit
 - clone: allow "--dissociate" without reference

 "git clone --dissociate" used to require that "--reference" was
 used at the same time, but you can create a new repository that
 borrows objects from another without using "--reference", namely
 with "clone --local" from a repository that borrows objects from
 other repositories.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* da/difftool (2015-10-21) 1 commit
 - difftool: gracefully handle symlinks to directories

 The code to reuse checked out files for comparison was too
 aggressive and forgot that symbolic links cannot be reused
 for comparison.

 Smells wrong that this special-cases based on the target of
 symbolic link.


* dt/name-hash-dir-entry-fix (2015-10-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-10-22 at 15eb519)
 + name-hash: don't reuse cache_entry in dir_entry

 The name-hash subsystem that is used to cope with case insensitive
 filesystems keeps track of directories and their on-filesystem
 cases for all the paths in the index by holding a pointer to a
 randomly chosen cache entry that is inside the directory (for its
 ce->ce_name component).  This pointer was not updated even when the
 cache entry was removed from the index, leading to use after free.
 This was fixed by recording the path for each directory instead of
 borrowing cache entries and restructuring the API somewhat.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/everyday-markup (2015-10-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-10-22 at 0a2702d)

* dk/gc-idx-wo-pack (2015-08-17) 3 commits
 - DONTMERGE: log message, grace-period and tests $gmane/276058
 - gc: remove stale .idx files without corresponding .pack file
 - prepare_packed_git(): refactor garbage reporting in pack directory

 Having a leftover .idx file without corresponding .pack file in
 the repository hurts performance; "git gc" learned to prune them.

 Waiting for a reroll.


* nd/ita-cleanup (2015-09-06) 6 commits
 - grep: make it clear i-t-a entries are ignored
 - checkout(-index): do not checkout i-t-a entries
 - apply: make sure check_preimage() does not leave empty file on error
 - apply: fix adding new files on i-t-a entries
 - add and use a convenience macro ce_intent_to_add()
 - blame: remove obsolete comment

 Paths that have been told the index about with "add -N" are not yet
 in the index, but various commands behaved as if they already are.

 Some commits need better explanation.

 Reroll exists but didn't pick it up as it seemed to be still
 collecting review comments.

* jc/diff-b-m (2015-02-23) 5 commits
 . WIPWIP
 . WIP: diff-b-m
 - diffcore-rename: allow easier debugging
 - diffcore-rename.c: add locate_rename_src()
 - diffcore-break: allow debugging

 "git diff -B -M" produced incorrect patch when the postimage of a
 completely rewritten file is similar to the preimage of a removed
 file; such a resulting file must not be expressed as a rename from
 other place.

 The fix in this patch is broken, unfortunately.

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* mh/notes-allow-reading-treeish (2015-10-08) 3 commits
 - notes: allow treeish expressions as notes ref
 + Merge branch 'jk/notes-dwim-doc' into next
 + Merge branch 'jc/merge-drop-old-syntax' into next
 (this branch uses jc/merge-drop-old-syntax.)

 Some "git notes" operations, e.g. "git log --notes=<note>", should
 be able to read notes from any tree-ish that is shaped like a notes
 tree, but the notes infrastructure required that the argument must
 be a ref under refs/notes/.  Loosen it to require a valid ref only
 when the operation would update the notes (in which case we must
 have a place to store the updated notes tree, iow, a ref).

 Will cook in 'next'.


* dt/refs-backend-pre-vtable (2015-10-15) 26 commits
 - refs: break out ref conflict checks

 - refs: make repack_without_refs and is_branch public
 - refs.c: create a public version of verify_refname_available
 - Merge branch 'jk/war-on-sprintf' into HEAD

 The early part of the pluggable ref backend series, which sifts the
 ref API functions into two bins: the filesystem backend specific
 ones and the generic API functions.  The next step will start
 introducing the framework to dispatch generic calls to specific
 backend implementation(s) and then finally plug a new backend that
 is different from the file backend.

 Expecting a reroll after an review of the remainder.

* jc/usage-stdin (2015-10-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-10-20 at 937d4aa)
 + usage: do not insist that standard input must come from a file

 The synopsis text and the usage string of subcommands that read
 list of things from the standard input are often shown as if they
 only take input from a file on a filesystem, which was misleading.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* rt/placeholder-in-usage (2015-10-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-10-20 at 5189b23)
 + am, credential-cache: add angle brackets to usage string

 A couple of commands still showed "[options]" in their usage string
 to note where options should come on their command line, but we
 spell that "[<options>]" in most places these days.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* tk/stripspace (2015-10-16) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-10-20 at 327a997)
 + stripspace: use parse-options for command-line parsing
 + strbuf: make stripspace() part of strbuf

 The internal stripspace() function has been moved to where it
 logically belongs to, i.e. strbuf API, and the command line parser
 of "git stripspace" has been updated to use the parse_options API.

 Add the "list" subcommand to "git worktree".

* jc/mailinfo (2015-10-21) 1 commit
 - mailinfo: ignore in-body header that we do not care about
 (this branch uses jc/am-mailinfo-direct and jc/mailinfo-lib.)

 Some people write arbitrary garbage at the beginning of a piece of
 e-mail (or after -- >8 -- scissors -- >8 -- line) in the commit log
 message and expect them to be discarded, even though "From:" and
 "Subject:" are the only documented in-body headers that you are
 supposed to have there.  Allow some garbage (specifically, what may
 look like RFC2822 headers like "MIME-Version: ...") to be there and
 ignore them.

 I have a feeling that that this is a step in a wrong direction.
 Comments?


* jc/am-mailinfo-direct (2015-10-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-10-22 at ca15014)
 + am: make direct call to mailinfo
 (this branch is used by jc/mailinfo; uses jc/mailinfo-lib.)

 "git am" used to spawn "git mailinfo" via run_command() API once
 per each patch, but learned to make a direct call to mailinfo()
 instead.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/mailinfo-lib (2015-10-21) 34 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-10-22 at 405bd66)

* jc/am-3-fallback-regression-fix (2015-10-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-10-15 at 7dde994)
 + am -3: do not let failed merge from completing the error codepath
 (this branch is used by js/am-3-merge-recursive-direct.)

 "git am -3" had a small regression where it is aborted in its error
 handling codepath when underlying merge-recursive failed in certain
 ways, as it assumed that the internal call to merge-recursive will
 never die, which is not the case (yet).

 Will merge to 'master'.


* js/am-3-merge-recursive-direct (2015-10-12) 2 commits
 - am: make a direct call to merge_recursive
 - merge_recursive_options: introduce the "gently" flag
 (this branch uses jc/am-3-fallback-regression-fix.)

 The merge_recursive_generic() function has been made a bit safer to
 call from inside a process.  "git am -3" was taught to make a direct
 call to the function when falling back to three-way merge.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* sg/pretty-more-date-mode-format (2015-10-07) 1 commit
 - pretty: add format specifiers for short and raw date formats

 Introduce "%as" and "%aR" placeholders for "log --format" to show
 the author date in the short and raw formats.

 I have a feeling that that this is a step in a wrong direction.
 Comments?


* kn/for-each-branch-remainder (2015-10-02) 9 commits
 - branch: implement '--format' option
 - branch: use ref-filter printing APIs
 - ref-filter: make %(upstream:track) prints "[gone]" for invalid upstreams
 - ref-filter: introduce format_ref_array_item()
 - ref-filter: adopt get_head_description() from branch.c
 - ref-filter: modify "%(objectname:short)" to take length
 - ref-filter: add support for %(path) atom
 - ref-filter: implement %(if:equals=<string>) and %(if:notequals=<string>)

* jk/graph-format-padding (2015-09-14) 1 commit
 - pretty: pass graph width to pretty formatting for use in '%>|(N)'

 Redefine the way '%>|(N)' padding and the "--graph" option
 interacts.  It has been that the available columns to display the
 log message was measured from the edge of the area the graph ended,
 but with this it becomes the beginning of the entire output.

 I have a suspicion that 50% of the users would appreciate this
 change, and the remainder see this break their expectation.  If
 that is the case, we might need to introduce a similar but
 different alignment operator so that this new behaviour is
 available to those who want to use it, without negatively affecting
 existing uses.

 Undecided.

 - rerere: delay the recording of preimage
 - rerere: handle leftover rr-cache/$ID directory and postimage files
 - rerere: scan $GIT_DIR/rr-cache/$ID when instantiating a rerere_id
 - rerere: split conflict ID further

 "git rerere" can encounter two or more files with the same conflict
