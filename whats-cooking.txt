What's cooking in git.git (Dec 2024, #04; Tue, 10)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and
aren't considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL
to a message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity (of course they can be resubmit when new interests
arise).

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-scm/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/

 + Allow cloning from repositories owned by another user

 Loosen overly strict ownership check introduced in the recent past,
 to keep the promise "cloning a suspicious repository is a safe
 first step to inspect it".

 - fetch: do not ask for HEAD unnecessarily
 - Merge branch 'bf/set-head-symref' into js/set-head-symref-fix
 (this branch uses bf/set-head-symref.)

 "git fetch" from a configured remote learned to update a missing
 remote-tracking HEAD but it asked the remote about their HEAD even
 when it did not need to, which has been corrected.  Incidentally,
 this also corrects "git fetch --tags $URL" which was broken by the
 new feature in an unspecified way.

* bf/set-head-symref (2024-11-25) 10 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2024-12-02 at b142ff3d8e)
 + fetch set_head: handle mirrored bare repositories
 + fetch: set remote/HEAD if it does not exist
 + refs: add create_only option to refs_update_symref_extended
 + refs: add TRANSACTION_CREATE_EXISTS error
 + remote set-head: better output for --auto
 + remote set-head: refactor for readability
 + refs: atomically record overwritten ref in update_symref
 + refs: standardize output of refs_read_symbolic_ref
 + t/t5505-remote: test failure of set-head
 + t/t5505-remote: set default branch to main
 (this branch is used by bf/fetch-set-head-config and jc/set-head-symref-fix.)

 When "git fetch $remote" notices that refs/remotes/$remote/HEAD is
 missing and discovers what branch the other side points with its
 HEAD, refs/remotes/$remote/HEAD is updated to point to it.

 Needs to wait until set-head-symref-fix topic solidifies.
