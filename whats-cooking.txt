What's cooking in git.git (Jan 2013, #04; Wed, 9)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.

So far, about 60 topics, most of which have been cooking since the
previous cycle, have been graduated to the 'master' branch in
preparation for the next release, which tentatively is called 1.8.2.
Many of these early topics are bugfixes and expected to later land
in the 'maint' branch for 1.8.1.1 release as well.

As usual, this cycle is expected to last for 8 to 10 weeks, with a
preview -rc0 sometime in the middle of next month.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches of the
repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* nz/send-email-headers-are-case-insensitive (2013-01-06) 1 commit
 - git-send-email: treat field names as case-insensitively

 When user spells "cc:" in lowercase in the fake "header" in the
 trailer part, send-email failed to pick up the addresses from
 there. As e-mail headers field names are case insensitive, this
 script should follow suit and treat "cc:" and "Cc:" the same way.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* mk/complete-tcsh (2013-01-07) 1 commit
 - Prevent space after directories in tcsh completion

 Update tcsh command line completion so that an unwanted space is
 not added to a single directory name.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 Teach commands in the "log" family to optionally pay attention to
 the mailmap.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* nd/upload-pack-shallow-must-be-commit (2013-01-08) 1 commit
 - upload-pack: only accept commits from "shallow" line

 A minor consistency check patch that does not have much relevance
 to the real world.

 Will merge to 'next'.

* ap/merge-stop-at-prepare-commit-msg-failure (2013-01-03) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-07 at 6790566)
 + merge: Honor prepare-commit-msg return code

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-01-04

 "git merge" started calling prepare-commit-msg hook like "git
 commit" does some time ago, but forgot to pay attention to the exit
 status of the hook.  t7505 may want a general clean-up but that is
 a different topic.


* as/test-name-alias-uniquely (2012-12-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-07 at 3b11c25)
 + Use longer alias names in subdirectory tests

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-01-02

 A few short-and-bland aliases used in the tests were interfering
 with git-custom command in user's $PATH.


* cc/no-gitk-build-dependency (2012-12-18) 3 commits
 + Makefile: replace "echo 1>..." with "echo >..."
 + Makefile: detect when PYTHON_PATH changes
 + Makefile: remove tracking of TCLTK_PATH

 Remove leftover bits from an earlier change to move gitk in its own
 subdirectory.  Reimplementing the dependency tracking rules needs
 to be done in gitk history separately.


* er/python-version-requirements (2012-12-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-07 at 4954e27)
 + Add checks to Python scripts for version dependencies.

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-01-02

 Some python scripts we ship cannot be run with old versions of the
 interpreter.


* er/stop-recommending-parsecvs (2012-12-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-07 at 689f28f)
 + Remove the suggestion to use parsecvs, which is currently broken.

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-01-02

 + Add new remote-bzr transport helper

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-01-04

 New remote helper for bzr, with minimum fix squashed in.


* jc/apply-trailing-blank-removal (2012-10-12) 1 commit
 + apply.c:update_pre_post_images(): the preimage can be truncated

 Fix to update_pre_post_images() that did not take into account the
 possibility that whitespace fix could shrink the preimage and
 change the number of lines in it.


* jc/submittingpatches (2013-01-02) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-07 at 1cc3b8e)
 + SubmittingPatches: give list and maintainer addresses

 + SubmittingPatches: mention subsystems with dedicated repositories
 + SubmittingPatches: who am I and who cares?

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-01-04

 Streamline the document and update with a few e-mail addresses the
 patches should be sent to.


* jk/enable-test-lint-by-default (2013-01-03) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-07 at 2a77155)
 + tests: turn on test-lint by default

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-01-04

 We had two simple and quick tests to catch common mistakes when
 writing test scripts, but they weren't run by default when running
 tests.


* jk/maint-fast-import-doc-dedup-done (2013-01-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-07 at af6a054)
 + git-fast-import(1): remove duplicate '--done' option

 The "logical order" reorganization can come after that is done and
 can cook longer in 'next'.


* jk/pathspec-literal (2013-01-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-07 at f0725cc)
 + t6130-pathspec-noglob: Windows does not allow a file named "f*"

 Finishing touches to unbreak a test on Windows.


* jn/less-reconfigure (2013-01-02) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-07 at 04c11cb)
 + build: do not automatically reconfigure unless configure.ac changed

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-01-02

 When autoconf is used, any build on a different commit always ran
 "config.status --recheck" even when unnecessary.


* jn/warn-on-inaccessible-loosen (2012-10-14) 4 commits
 + config: exit on error accessing any config file
 + doc: advertise GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM
 + config: treat user and xdg config permission problems as errors
 + config, gitignore: failure to access with ENOTDIR is ok

 Deal with a situation where .config/git is a file and we notice
 .config/git/config is not readable due to ENOTDIR, not ENOENT.


* kb/maint-bundle-doc (2013-01-01) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-07 at 3d2b1ea)
 + Documentation: full-ness of a bundle is significant for cloning

  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-07 at 5117679)
 + format-patch: pick up branch description when no ref is specified
 + format-patch: pick up correct branch name from symbolic ref
 + t4014: a few more tests on cover letter using branch description
 + branch: delete branch description if it's empty
 + config.txt: a few lines about branch.<name>.description

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-01-04

 Teach various forms of "format-patch" command line to identify what
 branch the patches are taken from, so that the branch description
 is picked up in more cases.


* os/gitweb-highlight-uncaptured (2013-01-01) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-07 at 5db0558)
 + gitweb: fix error in sanitize when highlight is enabled

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-01-04

 The code to sanitize control characters before passing it to
 "highlight" filter lost known-to-be-safe control characters by
 mistake.


* ta/remove-stale-translated-tut (2012-12-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-07 at 47b1056)
 + Remove Documentation/pt_BR/gittutorial.txt

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-01-02

 Remove a translation of a document that was left stale.


* tb/test-t9020-no-which (2013-01-01) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-07 at 9661948)
 + t9020: which is not portable

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-01-04

 Test portability update.

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-01-04

 Test portability update.

[Stalled]

* jl/submodule-deinit (2012-12-04) 1 commit
 - submodule: add 'deinit' command

 There was no Porcelain way to say "I no longer am interested in
 this submodule", once you express your interest in a submodule with
 "submodule init".  "submodule deinit" is the way to do so.

 Expecting a reroll.
 $gmane/212884


* jk/lua-hackery (2012-10-07) 6 commits
 - pretty: fix up one-off format_commit_message calls
 - Minimum compilation fixup
 - Makefile: make "lua" a bit more configurable
 - add a "lua" pretty format
 - add basic lua infrastructure
 - pretty: make some commit-parsing helpers more public

 Interesting exercise. When we do this for real, we probably would want
 to wrap a commit to make it more like an "object" with methods like
 "parents", etc.


* rc/maint-complete-git-p4 (2012-09-24) 1 commit
 - Teach git-completion about git p4

 Comment from Pete will need to be addressed ($gmane/206172).


* jc/maint-name-rev (2012-09-17) 7 commits
 - describe --contains: use "name-rev --algorithm=weight"
 - name-rev --algorithm=weight: tests and documentation
 - name-rev --algorithm=weight: cache the computed weight in notes
 - name-rev --algorithm=weight: trivial optimization
 - name-rev: --algorithm option
 - name_rev: clarify the logic to assign a new tip-name to a commit
 - name-rev: lose unnecessary typedef

 "git name-rev" names the given revision based on a ref that can be
 reached in the smallest number of steps from the rev, but that is
 not useful when the caller wants to know which tag is the oldest one
 that contains the rev.  This teaches a new mode to the command that
 uses the oldest ref among those which contain the rev.

 I am not sure if this is worth it; for one thing, even with the help
 from notes-cache, it seems to make the "describe --contains" even
 slower. Also the command will be unusably slow for a user who does
 not have a write access (hence unable to create or update the
 notes-cache).

 Stalled mostly due to lack of responses.


* jc/xprm-generation (2012-09-14) 1 commit
 - test-generation: compute generation numbers and clock skews

 A toy to analyze how bad the clock skews are in histories of real
 world projects.

 Stalled mostly due to lack of responses.


* jc/add-delete-default (2012-08-13) 1 commit
 - git add: notice removal of tracked paths by default

 "git add dir/" updated modified files and added new files, but does
 not notice removed files, which may be "Huh?" to some users.  They
 can of course use "git add -A dir/", but why should they?

 Resurrected from graveyard, as I thought it was a worthwhile thing
 to do in the longer term.

 Stalled mostly due to lack of responses.


* mb/remote-default-nn-origin (2012-07-11) 6 commits
 - Teach get_default_remote to respect remote.default.
 - Test that plain "git fetch" uses remote.default when on a detached HEAD.
 - Teach clone to set remote.default.
 - Teach "git remote" about remote.default.
 - Teach remote.c about the remote.default configuration setting.
 - Rename remote.c's default_remote_name static variables.

 When the user does not specify what remote to interact with, we
 often attempt to use 'origin'.  This can now be customized via a
 configuration variable.

 Expecting a reroll.
 $gmane/210151

 "The first remote becomes the default" bit is better done as a
 separate step.

* jc/blame-no-follow (2012-09-21) 2 commits
 - blame: pay attention to --no-follow
 - diff: accept --no-follow option

 Teaches "--no-follow" option to "git blame" to disable its
 whole-file rename detection.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* as/dir-c-cleanup (2012-12-28) 10 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-08 at 5aee090)

 + dir.c: rename path_excluded() to is_path_excluded()
 + dir.c: rename cryptic 'which' variable to more consistent name
 + Improve documentation and comments regarding directory traversal API
 + api-directory-listing.txt: update to match code
 (this branch is used by as/check-ignore.)

 Refactor and generally clean up the directory traversal API
 implementation.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/config-uname (2013-01-03) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-08 at f986500)
 + Makefile: hoist uname autodetection to config.mak.uname

 Move the bits to set fallback default based on the platform from
 the main Makefile to a separate file, so that it can be included in
 Makefiles in subdirectories.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/push-2.0-default-to-simple (2013-01-08) 11 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-09 at 74c3498)

  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-08 at 5ebf940)

 The internal logic had to deal with two representations of a death
 of a child process by a signal.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jl/interrupt-clone-remove-separate-git-dir (2013-01-05) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-08 at 568f874)

 When "git clone --separate-git-dir" is interrupted, we failed to
 remove the real location we created the repository.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* rs/leave-base-name-in-name-field-of-tar (2013-01-05) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-08 at 98f325e)
 + archive-tar: split long paths more carefully

 Improve compatibility with implementations of "tar" that do not
 like empty name field in header (with the additional prefix field
 holding everything).

 Will merge to 'master'.


* as/api-allocation-doc (2013-01-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-08 at c80b544)

 - Export parse_pathspec() and convert some get_pathspec() calls
 - pathspec: make sure the prefix part is wildcard-clean
 - Add parse_pathspec() that converts cmdline args to struct pathspec
 - pathspec: save the non-wildcard length part

 Uses the parsed pathspec structure in more places where we used to
 use the raw "array of strings" pathspec.

 Unfortunately, this conflicts a couple of topics in flight. I tried
 to be careful while resolving conflicts, though.

 Expecting a reroll after the dust settles.

 Updates zip tests to skip some that cannot be handled on platform
 unzip.

 I've renamed the t5002 in the original to t5003 to avoid name
 clashes with another topic in flight.

  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-08 at d9ec30e)

 Improve compatibility of our zip output to fill uncompressed size
 in the header, which we can do without seeking back (even though it
 should not be necessary).

 Will merge to 'master'.

 document was originally written.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* fc/remote-testgit-feature-done (2012-10-29) 1 commit
 - remote-testgit: properly check for errors

 In the longer term, tightening rules is a good thing to do, and
 because nobody who has worked in the remote helper area seems to be
 interested in reviewing this, I would assume they do not think
 such a retroactive tightening will affect their remote helpers.  So
 let's advance this topic to see what happens.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 fourth iteration of a patch series, to make it easier for the
 submitter to keep separate copies for iterations.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 Allows "git cherry-pick $commit" when you do not have any history
 behind HEAD yet.

 + Makefile: add USE_WILDMATCH to use wildmatch as fnmatch
 + wildmatch: advance faster in <asterisk> + <literal> patterns
 + wildmatch: make a special case for "*/" with FNM_PATHNAME
 + test-wildmatch: add "perf" command to compare wildmatch and fnmatch

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-01-04

 Replace our use of fnmatch(3) with a more feature-rich wildmatch.
 A handful patches at the bottom have been moved to nd/wildmatch to
 graduate as part of that branch, before this series solidifies.

 Will cook in 'next' a bit longer than other topics.

* zk/clean-report-failure (2013-01-06) 1 commit
 - git-clean: Display more accurate delete messages

 "git clean" states what it is going to remove and then goes on to
 remove it, but sometimes it only discovers things that cannot be
 removed after recursing into a directory, which makes the output
 confusing and even wrong.

 Expecting a response to $gmane/212860.


* mp/complete-paths (2012-12-21) 1 commit
 - git-completion.bash: add support for path completion

 The completion script used to let the default completer to suggest
 pathnames, which gave too many irrelevant choices (e.g. "git add"
 would not want to add an unmodified path).  Teach it to use a more
 git-aware logic to enumerate only relevant ones.

 It has been reported (no surprise) that this does not work inside
 subdirectory, and fixing it seems to be non-trivial. $gmane/212642

 Waiting for area-experts' help.

 hierarchies.
