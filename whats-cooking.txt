What's cooking in git.git (Dec 2011, #09; Tue, 27)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with '+' are in
'next'.

By now I know a bit better than taking the lack of serious regression
reports during the holiday weekend as a sign of perfection of the upcoming
release, but I will tag -rc0 soonish anyway. As far as I can see the tip
of 'master' is feature complete for 1.7.9, modulo possible bugs and
regressions.

Here are the repositories that have my integration branches:

With maint, master, next, pu, todo:

        git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git
        git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git
        https://code.google.com/p/git-core/
        https://github.com/git/git

With only maint and master:

        git://git.sourceforge.jp/gitroot/git-core/git.git
        git://git-core.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/git-core/git-core

With all the topics and integration branches:

        https://github.com/gitster/git

The preformatted documentation in HTML and man format are found in:

        git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-{htmldocs,manpages}.git/
        git://repo.or.cz/git-{htmldocs,manpages}.git/

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* jc/advise-push-default (2011-12-18) 1 commit
 - push: hint to use push.default=upstream when appropriate

Peff had a good suggestion outlining an updated code structure so that
somebody new can try to dip his or her toes in the development. Any
takers?

Waiting for a reroll.

* mh/ref-api-rest (2011-12-12) 35 commits
 - repack_without_ref(): call clear_packed_ref_cache()
 - read_packed_refs(): keep track of the directory being worked in
 - is_refname_available(): query only possibly-conflicting references
 - refs: read loose references lazily
 - read_loose_refs(): take a (ref_entry *) as argument
 - struct ref_dir: store a reference to the enclosing ref_cache
 - sort_ref_dir(): take (ref_entry *) instead of (ref_dir *)
 - do_for_each_ref_in_dir*(): take (ref_entry *) instead of (ref_dir *)
 - add_entry(): take (ref_entry *) instead of (ref_dir *)
 - search_ref_dir(): take (ref_entry *) instead of (ref_dir *)
 - find_containing_direntry(): use (ref_entry *) instead of (ref_dir *)
 - add_ref(): take (ref_entry *) instead of (ref_dir *)
 - read_packed_refs(): take (ref_entry *) instead of (ref_dir *)
 - find_ref(): take (ref_entry *) instead of (ref_dir *)
 - is_refname_available(): take (ref_entry *) instead of (ref_dir *)
 - get_loose_refs(): return (ref_entry *) instead of (ref_dir *)
 - get_packed_refs(): return (ref_entry *) instead of (ref_dir *)
 - refs: wrap top-level ref_dirs in ref_entries
 - get_ref_dir(): keep track of the current ref_dir
 - do_for_each_ref(): only iterate over the subtree that was requested
 - refs: sort ref_dirs lazily
 - sort_ref_dir(): do not sort if already sorted
 - refs: store references hierarchically
 - refs.c: rename ref_array -> ref_dir
 - struct ref_entry: nest the value part in a union
 - check_refname_component(): return 0 for zero-length components
 - free_ref_entry(): new function
 - refs.c: reorder definitions more logically
 - is_refname_available(): reimplement using do_for_each_ref_in_array()
 - names_conflict(): simplify implementation
 - names_conflict(): new function, extracted from is_refname_available()
 - repack_without_ref(): reimplement using do_for_each_ref_in_array()
 - do_for_each_ref_in_arrays(): new function
 - do_for_each_ref_in_array(): new function
 - do_for_each_ref(): correctly terminate while processesing extra_refs

The API for extra anchoring points may require rethought first; that would
hopefully make the "ref" part a lot simpler.

Waiting for a reroll.

* jc/split-blob (2011-12-01) 6 commits
 . WIP (streaming chunked)
 - chunked-object: fallback checkout codepaths
 - bulk-checkin: support chunked-object encoding
 - bulk-checkin: allow the same data to be multiply hashed
 - new representation types in the packstream
 - varint-in-pack: refactor varint encoding/decoding

Not ready.

At least pack-objects and fsck need to learn the new encoding for the
series to be usable locally, and then index-pack/unpack-objects needs to
learn it to be used remotely.

* jc/advise-i18n (2011-12-22) 1 commit
 - i18n of multi-line advice messages

Allow localization of advice messages that tend to be longer and
multi-line formatted. For now this is deliberately limited to advise()
interface and not vreportf() in general as touching the latter has
interactions with error() that has plumbing callers whose prefix "error: "
should never be translated.

[Cooking]

* pw/p4-docs-and-tests (2011-12-27) 11 commits
 - git-p4: document and test submit options

 - git-p4: introduce asciidoc documentation
 - rename git-p4 tests

Rorolled.
Not urgent.

* jc/signed-commit (2011-11-29) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-12-21 at 8fcbf00)
 + gpg-interface: allow use of a custom GPG binary
 + pretty: %G[?GS] placeholders
 + test "commit -S" and "log --show-signature"
 + log: --show-signature
 + commit: teach --gpg-sign option

I am ambivalent on this one. I do not desperately need it myself, I know
the kernel folks do not, I heard some other people might.

Opinions?
