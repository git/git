What's cooking in git.git (Apr 2013, #04; Fri, 12)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.

A handful of topics that have been stalled for quite a while have
been discarded; for those that are not superseded by something else,
interested parties can still resubmit a reroll, but without any
advances, we do not get any benefit from carrying them in my tree.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* po/help-guides (2013-04-03) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-04 at 3d99b28)
 + doc: include --guide option description for "git help"
 + help: mention -a and -g option, and 'git help <concept>' usage.
 + builtin/help.c: add list_common_guides_help() function
 + builtin/help.c: add --guide option
 + builtin/help.c: split "-a" processing into two

 "git help" learned "-g" option to show the list of guides just like
 list of commands are given with "-a".


* ap/combine-diff-coalesce-lost (2013-03-25) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-29 at f6a05ca)
 + combine-diff: coalesce lost lines optimally

 Attempts to minimize "diff -c/--cc" output by coalescing the same
 lines removed from the parents better, but with an O(n^2)
 complexity.


* js/rerere-forget-protect-against-NUL (2013-04-04) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-05 at 426d4e2)
 + rerere forget: do not segfault if not all stages are present
 + rerere forget: grok files containing NUL

 A few bugfixes to "git rerere" working on corner case merge
 conflicts.


* sr/log-SG-no-textconv (2013-04-05) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-05 at 7f06945)
 + diffcore-pickaxe: unify code for log -S/-G
 + diffcore-pickaxe: fix leaks in "log -S<block>" and "log -G<pattern>"
 + diffcore-pickaxe: port optimization from has_changes() to diff_grep()
 + diffcore-pickaxe: respect --no-textconv
 + diffcore-pickaxe: remove fill_one()
 + diffcore-pickaxe: remove unnecessary call to get_textconv()

 "git log -S/-G" started paying attention to textconv filter, but
 there was no way to disable this.  Make it honor --no-textconv
 option.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* po/help-guides (2013-04-12) 1 commit
 - help: mark common_guides[] as translatable

 Finishing touches.
 Will fast-track to 'master'.


* ap/strbuf-humanize (2013-04-10) 2 commits
 - count-objects: add -H option to humanize sizes
 - strbuf: create strbuf_humanise_bytes() to show byte sizes

 Teach "--human-readable" aka "-H" option to "git count-objects" to
 show various large numbers in Ki/Mi/GiB scaled as necessary.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 It may not be a bad idea to discard mc/count-objects-kibibytes,
 which can introduce regression to scripted users that expect the
 output to say "N kilobytes".  Opinions?


* as/clone-reference-with-gitfile (2013-04-09) 2 commits
 - clone: Allow repo using gitfile as a reference
 - clone: Fix error message for reference repository

 "git clone" did not work if a repository pointed at by the
 "--reference" option is a gitfile that points at another place.

 Waiting for comments.


* fc/transport-helper-error-reporting (2013-04-11) 3 commits
 - transport-helper: improve push messages
 - transport-helper: mention helper name when it dies
 - transport-helper: report errors properly

 Rerolled enough times.  In-code comments may want to be further
 extended to explain tricky parts, but seems to be ready otherwise.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jc/decorate (2013-04-07) 2 commits
 - decorate: add "clear_decoration()"
 - decorate: document API
 (this branch is used by jc/gg.)

 Will discard.


* jc/gg (2013-04-08) 3 commits

 - doc/http-backend: give some lighttpd config examples
 - doc/http-backend: clarify "half-auth" repo configuration

 Improve documentation to illustrate "push authenticated, fetch
 anonymous" configuration for smart HTTP servers.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/gitweb-utf8 (2013-04-08) 4 commits
 - gitweb: Fix broken blob action parameters on blob/commitdiff pages
 - gitweb: Don't append ';js=(0|1)' to external links
 - gitweb: Make feed title valid utf8
 - gitweb: Fix utf8 encoding for blob_plain, blobdiff_plain, commitdiff_plain, and patch

 Various fixes to gitweb.

 Waiting for a reroll after a review.


* jk/submodule-subdirectory-ok (2013-04-10) 2 commits
 - submodule: drop the top-level requirement
 - rev-parse: add --prefix option

 Allow various subcommands of "git submodule" to be run not from the
 top of the working tree of the superproject.

 Waiting for comments.


* kb/co-orphan-suggestion-short-sha1 (2013-04-08) 1 commit
 - checkout: abbreviate hash in suggest_reattach

 Update the informational message when "git checkout" leaves the
 detached head state.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* mv/sequencer-pick-error-diag (2013-04-11) 1 commit
 - cherry-pick: make sure all input objects are commits

 "git cherry-pick $blob $tree" is diagnosed as a nonsense.

 Will merge to 'next'.

* rs/empty-archive (2013-04-10) 1 commit
 - t5004: fix issue with empty archive test and bsdtar

 Implementations of "tar" of BSD descend have found to have trouble
 with reading an otherwise empty tar archive with pax headers and
 causes an unnecessary test failure.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* th/t9903-symlinked-workdir (2013-04-11) 1 commit
 - t9903: Don't fail when run from path accessed through symlink

 Will merge to 'next'.


* fc/completion (2013-04-12) 9 commits
 - completion: small optimization
 - completion: inline __gitcomp_1 to its sole callsite
 - completion: get rid of compgen
 - completion: add __gitcomp_nl tests
 - SQUASH??? avoid referencing undefined positional vars???
 - completion: add new __gitcompadd helper
 - completion: get rid of empty COMPREPLY assignments
 - completion: trivial test improvement
 - completion: add more cherry-pick options

 Looked mostly good.

 Will merge to 'next', after squashing the fix in.


* jk/daemon-user-doc (2013-04-12) 1 commit
 - doc: clarify that "git daemon --user=<user>" option does not export HOME=~user

 Will merge to 'next'.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* nd/pretty-formats (2013-04-01) 12 commits
 - pretty: support %>> that steal trailing spaces
 - pretty: support truncating in %>, %< and %><
 - pretty: support padding placeholders, %< %> and %><
 - pretty: add %C(auto) for auto-coloring on the next placeholder
 - pretty: two phase conversion for non utf-8 commits
 - utf8: keep NULs in reencode_string()
 - pretty: get the correct encoding for --pretty:format=%e
 - pretty: save commit encoding from logmsg_reencode if the caller needs it
 - utf8.c: add utf8_strnwidth() with the ability to skip ansi sequences
 - utf8.c: move display_mode_esc_sequence_len() for use by other functions
 - pretty: share code between format_decoration and show_decorations
 - pretty-formats.txt: wrap long lines

 A mixed bag of a bugfix and two fun enhancements on pretty formats
 placeholder.

 Expecting a reroll.


* jc/format-patch (2013-02-21) 2 commits
 - format-patch: --inline-single
 - format-patch: rename "no_inline" field

 A new option to send a single patch to the standard output to be
 appended at the bottom of a message.  I personally have no need for
 this, but it was easy enough to cobble together.  Tests, docs and
 stripping out more MIMEy stuff are left as exercises to interested
 parties.

 Not ready for inclusion.

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* fc/send-email-annotate (2013-04-07) 6 commits
 - format-patch: trivial cleanups
 - format-patch: add format.coverLetter configuration variable
 - log: update to OPT_BOOL
 - format-patch: refactor branch name calculation
 - format-patch: improve head calculation for cover-letter
 - send-email: make annotate configurable

 Looked basically OK to me. Comments?


* jk/http-error-messages (2013-04-06) 9 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-11 at 7a03981)
 + http: drop http_error function

 + http: re-word http error message
 + http: simplify http_error helper function
 + remote-curl: consistently report repo url for http errors
 + remote-curl: always show friendlier 404 message
 + remote-curl: let servers override http 404 advice
 + remote-curl: show server content on http errors
 + http: add HTTP_KEEP_ERROR option

 Improve error reporting from the http transfer clients.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/show-branch-strbuf (2013-04-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-11 at 7a20aa5)
 + show-branch: use strbuf instead of static buffer

 "git show-branch" was not prepared to show a very long run of
 ancestor operators e.g. foobar^2~2^2^2^2...^2~4 correctly.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* lf/bundle-with-tip-wo-message (2013-04-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-11 at bb9f869)
 + bundle: Accept prerequisites without commit messages

 "git bundle" did not like a bundle created using a commit without
 any message as its one of the prerequistes.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* rt/commentchar-fmt-merge-msg (2013-04-07) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-11 at 6af638b)
 + fmt-merge-msg: use core.commentchar in tag signatures completely
 + fmt-merge-msg: respect core.commentchar in people credits

 The new core.commentchar configuration was not applied to a few
 places.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* fc/remote-hg (2013-04-11) 21 commits
 - remote-hg: activate graphlog extension for hg_log()

 - remote-hg: fix for files with spaces
 - remote-hg: properly report errors on bookmark pushes
 - remote-hg: add missing config variable in doc
 - remote-hg: trivial cleanups

 Rerolled.

 Waiting for comments.


* mc/count-objects-kibibytes (2013-04-03) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-05 at f4e50e8)
 + count-objects: output "KiB" instead of "kilobytes"

 The command reports the total diskspace used to store loose objects
 in kibibytes, but it was labelled as "kilobytes".  The number now
 is shown with "KiB", e.g. "6750 objects, 50928 KiB".

 If you have scripts that decide when to run "git repack" by parsing
 the output from "git count-objects", this release may break them.
 Sorry about that.  One of the scripts shipped by git-core itself
 also had to be adjusted.  You may want to consider updating such
 scripts to always call "git gc --auto" to let it decide when to
 repack for you.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/http-dumb-namespaces (2013-04-09) 1 commit
 - http-backend: respect GIT_NAMESPACE with dumb clients

 Allow smart-capable HTTP servers to be restricted via the
 GIT_NAMESPACE mechanism when talking with commit-walker clients
 (they already do so when talking with smart HTTP clients).

 Will merge to 'next'.



* jl/submodule-mv (2013-04-11) 4 commits
 - rm: delete .gitmodules entry of submodules removed from the work tree
 - Teach mv to update the path entry in .gitmodules for moved submodules
 - Teach mv to move submodules using a gitfile
 - Teach mv to move submodules together with their work trees

 "git mv A B" when moving a submodule A does "the right thing",
 inclusing relocating its working tree and adjusting the paths in
 the .gitmodules file.

 Seems to break tests in 'pu' but it may be a mismerge with
 nd/magic-pathspecs topic.


* tr/perl-keep-stderr-open (2013-04-04) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-07 at 04f737a)
 + t9700: do not close STDERR
 + perl: redirect stderr to /dev/null instead of closing

 Closing (not redirecting to /dev/null) the standard error stream is
 not a very smart thing to do.  Later open may return file
 descriptor #2 for unrelated purpose, and error reporting code may
 write into them.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/detached-head-doc (2013-04-05) 1 commit
 - glossary: extend "detached HEAD" description

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/diff-algo-finishing-touches (2013-04-05) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-11 at af83b2b)
 + diff: allow unstuck arguments with --diff-algorithm
 + git-merge(1): document diff-algorithm option to merge-recursive

 "git diff --diff-algorithm algo" is also understood as "git diff
 --diff-algorithm=algo".

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/diff-graph-submodule-summary (2013-04-05) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-11 at 70dfa8d)
 + submodule: print graph output next to submodule log

 Make "git diff --graph" work better with submodule log output.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/merge-tree-added-identically (2013-04-08) 1 commit
 - merge-tree: don't print entries that match "local"

 The resolution of some corner cases by "git merge-tree" were
 inconsistent between top-of-the-tree and in a subdirectory.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* kb/status-ignored-optim (2013-03-19) 8 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-01 at 0c12ed9)
 + dir.c: git-status: avoid is_excluded checks for tracked files
 + dir.c: replace is_path_excluded with now equivalent is_excluded API
 + dir.c: unify is_excluded and is_path_excluded APIs
 + dir.c: move prep_exclude and factor out parts of last_exclude_matching
 + dir.c: git-status --ignored: don't list empty directories as ignored
 + dir.c: git-status --ignored: don't list empty ignored directories
 + dir.c: git-status --ignored: don't list files in ignored directories
 + dir.c: git-status --ignored: don't drop ignored directories

 "git status --ignored" had many corner case bugs.  Also the command
 has been optimized by taking advantage of the fact that paths that
 are already known to the index do not have to be checked against
 the .gitignore mechanism most of the time.

 Will cook in 'next'.

 This codepath is used not only by status but also in add and clean,
 so a bug in it can result in lost data.  Extra sets of eyeballs are
 very much appreciated.


* jn/add-2.0-u-A-sans-pathspec (2013-04-03) 6 commits
 - git add: -u/-A now affects the entire working tree
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-05 at eae93ef)
 + add -A: only show pathless 'add -A' warning when changes exist outside cwd
 + add -u: only show pathless 'add -u' warning when changes exist outside cwd
 + add: make warn_pathless_add() a no-op after first call
 + add: add a blank line at the end of pathless 'add [-u|-A]' warning
 + add: make pathless 'add [-u|-A]' warning a file-global function

 "git add -u/-A" without any pathspec traditionally limited its
 operation to the current directory when run from a subdirectory,
 but in Git 2.0, they will affect the entire working tree.  Start
 training users to explicitly say "." or ":/" to smooth out the
 transition hump with the earlier parts of this series, and flip the
 default as the final step.

 Will cook in 'next' until Git 2.0.


* tr/packed-object-info-wo-recursion (2013-03-27) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-29 at b1c3858)
 + sha1_file: remove recursion in unpack_entry
 + Refactor parts of in_delta_base_cache/cache_or_unpack_entry
 + sha1_file: remove recursion in packed_object_info

 Attempts to reduce the stack footprint of sha1_object_info()
 and unpack_entry() codepaths.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* nd/magic-pathspecs (2013-03-31) 45 commits
 - Rename field "raw" to "_raw" in struct pathspec
 - pathspec: support :(glob) syntax
 - pathspec: make --literal-pathspecs disable pathspec magic
 - pathspec: support :(literal) syntax for noglob pathspec
 - Kill limit_pathspec_to_literal() as it's only used by parse_pathspec()
 - parse_pathspec: preserve prefix length via PATHSPEC_PREFIX_ORIGIN
 - parse_pathspec: make sure the prefix part is wildcard-free
 - tree-diff: remove the use of pathspec's raw[] in follow-rename codepath
 - Remove match_pathspec() in favor of match_pathspec_depth()
 - Remove init_pathspec() in favor of parse_pathspec()
 - Remove diff_tree_{setup,release}_paths

 - Convert add_files_to_cache to take struct pathspec
 - Convert {read,fill}_directory to take struct pathspec
 - Convert refresh_index to take struct pathspec
 - Convert report_path_error to take struct pathspec
 - checkout: convert read_tree_some to take struct pathspec
 - Convert unmerge_cache to take struct pathspec
 - Convert run_add_interactive to use struct pathspec
 - Convert read_cache_preload() to take struct pathspec
 - reset: convert to use parse_pathspec
 - add: convert to use parse_pathspec
 - check-ignore: convert to use parse_pathspec
 - archive: convert to use parse_pathspec
 - ls-files: convert to use parse_pathspec
 - rm: convert to use parse_pathspec
 - checkout: convert to use parse_pathspec
 - rerere: convert to use parse_pathspec
 - status: convert to use parse_pathspec
 - commit: convert to use parse_pathspec
 - clean: convert to use parse_pathspec
 - Guard against new pathspec magic in pathspec matching code
 - parse_pathspec: support prefixing original patterns
 - parse_pathspec: support stripping/checking submodule paths
 - parse_pathspec: support stripping submodule trailing slashes
 - parse_pathspec: a special flag for max_depth feature
 - Convert some get_pathspec() calls to parse_pathspec()
 - parse_pathspec: add PATHSPEC_PREFER_{CWD,FULL}
 - parse_pathspec: save original pathspec for reporting
 - Add parse_pathspec() that converts cmdline args to struct pathspec
 - pathspec: add copy_pathspec
 - pathspec: i18n-ize error strings in pathspec parsing code
 - Move struct pathspec and related functions to pathspec.[ch]
 - clean: remove unused variable "seen"
 - setup.c: check that the pathspec magic ends with ")"

 Migrate the rest of codebase to use "struct pathspec" more.

 Will merge to 'next' after all the dust settles.


* jc/add-2.0-delete-default (2013-03-08) 3 commits
 - git add <pathspec>... defaults to "-A"
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-05 at 199442e)
 + git add: start preparing for "git add <pathspec>..." to default to "-A"
 + builtin/add.c: simplify boolean variables

 In Git 2.0, "git add pathspec" will mean "git add -A pathspec".  If
 you did this in a working tree that tracks dir/lost and dir/another:

 $ rm dir/lost
 $ edit dir/another
 $ git add dir

 The last step will not only notices and records updated
 dir/another, but also notices and records the removal of dir/lost
 in the index.

 Start training the users for this change to say --no-all when they
 want to ignore the removal to smooth the transition hump.

 Will cook in 'next' until Git 2.0.


* tr/line-log (2013-04-12) 11 commits
 - log -L: improve comments in process_all_files()
 - log -L: store the path instead of a diff_filespec
 - log -L: test merge of parallel modify/rename
 - t4211: pass -M to 'git log -M -L...' test
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-05 at 5afb00c)
 + log -L: fix overlapping input ranges
 + log -L: check range set invariants when we look it up
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-01 at 5be920c)
 + Speed up log -L... -M
 + log -L: :pattern:file syntax to find by funcname
 + Implement line-history search (git log -L)
 + Export rewrite_parents() for 'log -L'
 + Refactor parse_loc


* jc/push-2.0-default-to-simple (2013-04-03) 13 commits
 - push: switch default from "matching" to "simple"
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-05 at 1b42c19)
 + t5570: do not assume the "matching" push is the default
 + t5551: do not assume the "matching" push is the default
 + t5550: do not assume the "matching" push is the default
 + t9401: do not assume the "matching" push is the default
 + t9400: do not assume the "matching" push is the default
 + t7406: do not assume the "matching" push is the default
 + t5531: do not assume the "matching" push is the default
 + t5519: do not assume the "matching" push is the default
 + t5517: do not assume the "matching" push is the default
 + t5516: do not assume the "matching" push is the default
 + t5505: do not assume the "matching" push is the default
 + t5404: do not assume the "matching" push is the default

 Update the test suite that still assumed the push.default will
 forever be 'matching'.  In Git 2.0, that will no longer be the
 case.

 Will cook in 'next' until Git 2.0.

[Discarded]

* fc/transport-helper-waitpid (2013-04-07) 3 commits
 . SQUASH???
 . transport-helper: check if remote helper is alive
 . [EXPLAIN BETTER] run-command: add new check_command helper

 fc/transport-helper-error-reporting supersedes this topic.
