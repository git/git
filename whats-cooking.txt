What's cooking in git.git (Jul 2015, #04; Mon, 13)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.

2.5.0-rc2 today, 2.5.0-rc3 next week today.  We'll judge when to end
the cycle, reviewing what we have, at that point.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

* es/worktree-add (2015-07-12) 24 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-07-12 at 4926868)
 + Revert "checkout: retire --ignore-other-worktrees in favor of --force"

 + Documentation/git-worktree: add BUGS section
 + Documentation: move linked worktree description from checkout to worktree
 + Documentation/git-worktree: associate options with commands
 + Documentation/git-checkout: fix incorrect worktree prune command
 (this branch is used by es/worktree-add-cleanup; uses nd/multiple-work-trees.)

 Update to the "linked checkout" in 2.5.0-rc1.

 Instead of "checkout --to" that does not do what "checkout"
 normally does, move the functionality to "git worktree add".

 As this makes the end-user experience of the "worktree add" more or
 less complete, I am tempted to say we should cook the other topic
 that removes the internal "new-worktree-mode" hack from "checkout"
 a bit longer in 'next', and release 2.5 final without that one.


* et/http-proxyauth (2015-06-29) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-07-09 at cf80874)
 + http: always use any proxy auth method available

 We used to ask libCURL to use the most secure authentication method
 available when talking to an HTTP proxy only when we were told to
 talk to one via configuration variables.  We now ask libCURL to
 always use the most secure authentication method, because the user
 can tell libCURL to use an HTTP proxy via an environment variable
 without using configuration variables.


* jc/fsck-retire-require-eoh (2015-06-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-07-09 at dbc292b)
 + fsck: it is OK for a tag and a commit to lack the body

 A fix to a minor regression to "git fsck" in v2.2 era that started
 complaining about a body-less tag object when it lacks a separator
 empty line after its header to separate it with a non-existent body.


* jc/unexport-git-pager-in-use-in-pager (2015-07-03) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-07-09 at bff19cd)
 + pager: do not leak "GIT_PAGER_IN_USE" to the pager

 When you say "!<ENTER>" while running say "git log", you'd confuse
 yourself in the resulting shell, that may look as if you took
 control back to the original shell you spawned "git log" from but
 that isn't what is happening.  To that new shell, we leaked
 GIT_PAGER_IN_USE environment variable that was meant as a local
 communication between the original "Git" and subprocesses that was
 spawned by it after we launched the pager, which caused many
 "interesting" things to happen, e.g. "git diff | cat" still paints
 its output in color by default.

 Stop leaking that environment variable to the pager's half of the
 fork; we only need it on "Git" side when we spawn the pager.


* js/rebase-i-clean-up-upon-continue-to-skip (2015-06-29) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-07-09 at b844d9a)
 + rebase -i: do not leave a CHERRY_PICK_HEAD file behind
 + t3404: demonstrate CHERRY_PICK_HEAD bug

 Abandoning an already applied change in "git rebase -i" with
 "--continue" left CHERRY_PICK_HEAD and confused later steps.


* kb/config-unmap-before-renaming (2015-06-30) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-07-10 at 6b89478)
 + config.c: fix writing config files on Windows network shares

 "git config" failed to update the configuration file when the
 underlying filesystem is incapable of renaming a file that is still
 open.


* kb/use-nsec-doc (2015-07-01) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-07-09 at e7e5a05)
 + Makefile / racy-git.txt: clarify USE_NSEC prerequisites

 Clarify in the Makefile a guideline to decide use of USE_NSEC.


* mh/strbuf-read-file-returns-ssize-t (2015-07-03) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-07-09 at 0d8544e)
 + strbuf: strbuf_read_file() should return ssize_t

 Avoid possible ssize_t to int truncation.


* nd/multiple-work-trees (2015-06-29) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-06-29 at fd4eb60)
 + worktree: new place for "git prune --worktrees"
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-06-24 at 7c3f918)
 + checkout: don't check worktrees when not necessary
 (this branch is used by es/worktree-add and es/worktree-add-cleanup.)

 "git checkout [<tree-ish>] <paths>" spent unnecessary cycles
 checking if the current branch was checked out elsewhere, when we
 know we are not switching the branches ourselves.


* ss/clone-guess-dir-name-simplify (2015-07-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-07-10 at 8a62f4d)
 + clone: simplify string handling in guess_dir_name()

 Code simplification.

* jc/diff-ws-error-highlight (2015-07-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-07-12 at 15b60ce)
 + diff: parse ws-error-highlight option more strictly

 A hotfix to a new feature in 2.5.0-rc.


* es/worktree-add-cleanup (2015-07-13) 17 commits
 - checkout: drop intimate knowledge of new worktree initial population
 - worktree: populate via "git reset --hard" rather than "git checkout"
 - worktree: avoid resolving HEAD unnecessarily
 - worktree: make setup of new HEAD distinct from worktree population
 - fixup! worktree: detect branch symref/detach and error conditions locally
 - worktree: detect branch symref/detach and error conditions locally
 - worktree: add_worktree: construct worktree-population command locally
 - worktree: make branch creation distinct from worktree population
 - worktree: make --detach mutually exclusive with -b/-B
 - worktree: introduce options container
 - worktree: simplify new branch (-b/-B) option checking
 - branch: publish die_if_checked_out()
 - checkout: generalize die_if_checked_out() branch name argument
 - checkout: die_if_checked_out: simplify strbuf management
 - checkout: improve die_if_checked_out() robustness
 - checkout: name check_linked_checkouts() more meaningfully
 - checkout: avoid resolving HEAD unnecessarily

 Remove the "new-worktree-mode" hack in "checkout" that was added in
 nd/multiple-work-trees topic by updating the implementation of new
 "worktree add".

 Need to look at the fixup! more and then amend it.  After that
 will think if this should be part of 2.5 final.  My current
 thinking is we should ship 2.5 with es/worktree-add but not this
 one, as the end-user experience would not change.


* ib/scripted-parse-opt-better-hint-string (2015-07-13) 1 commit
 - rev-parse --parseopt: allow [*=?!] in argument hints

 The "rev-parse --parseopt" mode parsed the option specification
 and the argument hint in a strange way to allow '=' and other
 special characters in the option name while forbidding them from
 the argument hint.  This made it impossible to define an option
 like "--pair <key>=<value>" with "pair=key=value" specification,
 which instead would have defined a "--pair=key <value>" option.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* mh/fast-import-optimize-current-from (2015-07-13) 1 commit
 - fast-import: do less work when given "from" matches current branch head

 Often a fast-import stream builds a new commit on top of the
 previous commit it built, and it often unconditionally emits a
 "from" command to specify the first parent, which can be omitted in
 such a case.  This caused fast-import to forget the tree of the
 previous commit and then re-read it from scratch, which was
 inefficient.  Optimize for this common case.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* mh/notes-allow-reading-treeish (2015-07-13) 1 commit
 - notes: allow treeish expressions as notes ref

 Some "git notes" operations, e.g. "git log --notes=<note>", should
 be able to read notes from any tree-ish that is shaped like a notes
 tree, but the notes infrastructure required that the argument must
 be a ref under refs/notes/.  Loosen it to require a valid ref only
 when the operation would update the notes (in which case we must
 have a place to store the updated notes tree, iow, a ref).

 Needs update to docs.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* sg/config-name-only (2015-05-28) 3 commits
 - completion: use new 'git config' options to reliably list variable names
 - SQUASH
 - config: add options to list only variable names

 "git config --list" output was hard to parse when values consist of
 multiple lines.  Introduce a way to show only the keys.

 Adding a single --name-only option may be a better way to go than
 adding two new options.

 Expecting a reroll.


* kk/log-merges-config (2015-04-21) 5 commits
 - bash-completion: add support for git-log --merges= and log.merges
 - t4202-log: add tests for --merges=
 - Documentation: add git-log --merges= option and log.merges config. var
 - log: honor log.merges= option
 - revision: add --merges={show|only|hide} option

 "git log" (but not other commands in the "log" family) learned to
 pay attention to the log.merges configuration variable that can be
 set to "show" (the normal behaviour), "only" (hide non-merge
 commits), or "hide" (hide merge commits).  --merges=(show|only|hide)
 can be used to override the setting from the command line.

 The documentation may need to be updated once more ($gmane/267250).
 Waiting for a reroll.


* mg/httpd-tests-update-for-apache-2.4 (2015-04-08) 2 commits
 - t/lib-git-svn: check same httpd module dirs as lib-httpd
 - t/lib-httpd: load mod_unixd

 This is the first two commits in a three-patch series $gmane/266962
 Will be rerolled.
 with updated log message ($gmane/268061).


* mh/numparse (2015-03-19) 14 commits
 - diff_opt_parse(): use convert_i() when handling --abbrev=<num>
 - diff_opt_parse(): use convert_i() when handling "-l<num>"
 - opt_arg(): simplify pointer handling
 - opt_arg(): report errors parsing option values
 - opt_arg(): use convert_i() in implementation
 - opt_arg(): val is always non-NULL
 - builtin_diff(): detect errors when parsing --unified argument
 - handle_revision_opt(): use convert_ui() when handling "--abbrev="
 - strtoul_ui(), strtol_i(): remove functions
 - handle_revision_opt(): use convert_i() when handling "-<digit>"
 - handle_revision_opt(): use skip_prefix() in many places
 - write_subdirectory(): use convert_ui() for parsing mode
 - cacheinfo_callback(): use convert_ui() when handling "--cacheinfo"
 - numparse: new module for parsing integral numbers

 Many codepaths use unchecked use of strtol() and friends (or even
 worse, atoi()).  Introduce a set of wrappers that try to be more
 careful.

 Expecting a reroll.
 ($gmane/268058).


* tf/gitweb-project-listing (2015-03-19) 5 commits
 - gitweb: make category headings into links when they are directories
 - gitweb: optionally set project category from its pathname
 - gitweb: add a link under the search box to clear a project filter
 - gitweb: if the PATH_INFO is incomplete, use it as a project_filter
 - gitweb: fix typo in man page

 Update gitweb to make it more pleasant to deal with a hierarchical
 forest of repositories.

 Any comments from those who use or have their own code in Gitweb?


* jc/a-lone-dash-stands-for-previous-branch (2015-03-16) 1 commit
 - "-" and "@{-1}" on various programs

 Lose special case code to make a lone dash "-" mean the previous
 branch aka "@{-1}" from a handful subcommands, and instead support
 the notation throughout the system by reimplementing it at the
 revisions layer.

 Needs tests, documentation updates, etc.  Also does only a half-way
 job dealing with range notation, which needs to be fixed before the
 series goes anywhere.


* nd/list-files (2015-02-09) 21 commits
 - t3080: tests for git-list-files
 - list-files: -M aka diff-cached
 - list-files -F: show submodules with the new indicator '&'
 - list-files: add -F/--classify
 - list-files: show directories as well as files
 - list-files: do not show duplicate cached entries
 - list-files: sort output and remove duplicates
 - list-files: add -t back
 - list-files: add -1 short for --no-column
 - list-files: add -R/--recursive short for --max-depth=-1
 - list-files: -u does not imply showing stages
 - list-files: make alias 'ls' default to 'list-files'
 - list-files: a user friendly version of ls-files and more
 - ls-files: support --max-depth
 - ls-files: add --column
 - ls-files: add --color to highlight file names
 - ls-files: buffer full item in strbuf before printing
 - ls_colors.c: highlight submodules like directories
 - ls_colors.c: add a function to color a file name
 - ls_colors.c: parse color.ls.* from config file
 - ls_colors.c: add $LS_COLORS parsing code

 A new "git list-files" Porcelain command, "ls-files" with bells and
 whistles.

 Reroll to base on wt-status work ($gmane/265142) has seen some
 positive discussions.

 Waiting for a further polished reroll ($gmane/265534).


* nd/pathspec-strip-fix (2015-04-18) 1 commit
 - pathspec: adjust prefixlen after striping trailing slash

 Does not quite fix ($gmane/267614).
 Will discard.


* jc/diff-b-m (2015-02-23) 5 commits
 . WIPWIP
 . WIP: diff-b-m
 - diffcore-rename: allow easier debugging
 - diffcore-rename.c: add locate_rename_src()
 - diffcore-break: allow debugging

 "git diff -B -M" produced incorrect patch when the postimage of a
 completely rewritten file is similar to the preimage of a removed
 file; such a resulting file must not be expressed as a rename from
 other place.

 The fix in this patch is broken, unfortunately.


* pw/remote-set-url-fetch (2014-11-26) 1 commit
 - remote: add --fetch and --both options to set-url

 Expecting a reroll.


* tr/remerge-diff (2014-11-10) 9 commits
 - t4213: avoid "|" in sed regexp
 - log --remerge-diff: show what the conflict resolution changed
 - name-hash: allow dir hashing even when !ignore_case
 - merge-recursive: allow storing conflict hunks in index
 - merge_diff_mode: fold all merge diff variants into an enum
 - combine-diff: do not pass revs->dense_combined_merges redundantly
 - merge-recursive: -Xindex-only to leave worktree unchanged
 - merge-recursive: internal flag to avoid touching the worktree
 - merge-recursive: remove dead conditional in update_stages()

 "log -p" output learns a new way to let users inspect a merge
 commit by showing the differences between the automerged result
 with conflicts the person who recorded the merge would have seen
 and the final conflict resolution that was recorded in the merge.

 Waiting for a reroll.
 ($gmane/256591).


* tg/perf-lib-test-perf-cleanup (2013-09-19) 2 commits
 - perf-lib: add test_perf_cleanup target
 - perf-lib: split starting the test from the execution

 Add test_perf_cleanup shell function to the perf suite, that allows
 the script writers to define a test with a clean-up action.

 Will hold.


* jc/show-branch (2014-03-24) 5 commits
 - show-branch: use commit slab to represent bitflags of arbitrary width
 - show-branch.c: remove "all_mask"
 - show-branch.c: abstract out "flags" operation
 - show-branch.c: lift all_mask/all_revs to a global static
 - show-branch.c: update comment style

 Waiting for the final step to lift the hard-limit.

 - Documentation/tag: remove double occurance of "<pattern>"

 Will merge to 'next'.


* se/doc-checkout-ours-theirs (2015-07-12) 1 commit
 - checkout: document subtlety around --ours/--theirs

 A "rebase" replays changes of the local branch on top of something
 else, as such they are placed in stage #3 and referred to as
 "theirs", while the changes in the new base, typically a foreign
 work, are placed in stage #2 and referred to as "ours".  Clarify
 the "checkout --ours/--theirs".

 - t3901: test git-am encoding conversion
 - t3418: non-interactive rebase --continue with rerere enabled

* dt/refs-backend-preamble (2015-07-08) 8 commits
 - git-stash: use update-ref --create-reflog instead of creating files
 - update-ref and tag: add --create-reflog arg
 - git-reflog: add exists command
 - refs: new public ref function: safe_create_reflog
 - refs: Break out check for reflog autocreation
 - bisect: treat BISECT_HEAD as a ref
 - cherry-pick: treat CHERRY_PICK_HEAD and REVERT_HEAD as refs
 - refs.c: add err arguments to reflog functions

 In preparation for allowing different "backends" to store the refs
 in a way different from the traditional "one ref per file in $GIT_DIR
 or in a $GIT_DIR/packed-refs file" filesystem storage, reduce
 direct filesystem access to ref-like things like CHERRY_PICK_HEAD
 from scripts and programs.

 Still under discussion.

* nd/export-worktree (2015-06-26) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-07-09 at 1581a9b)
 + setup: set env $GIT_WORK_TREE when work tree is set, like $GIT_DIR

 Code clean-up and minor fixes (so far).


* ad/bisect-terms (2015-06-29) 4 commits
 - bisect: allow setting any user-specified in 'git bisect start'
 - bisect: add 'git bisect terms' to view the current terms
 - bisect: add the terms old/new
 - bisect: sanity check on terms
 (this branch uses ad/bisect-cleanup.)

 The use of 'good/bad' in "git bisect" made it confusing to use when
 hunting for a state change that is not a regression (e.g. bugfix).
 The command learned 'old/new' and then allows the end user to
 say e.g. "bisect start --term-old=fast --term=new=slow" to find a
 performance regression.

 Michael's idea to make 'good/bad' more intelligent does have
 certain attractiveness ($gname/272867), and makes some of the work
 on this topic a moot point.

 Will hold.

 - format-patch: introduce format.outputDirectory configuration

 Reroll exists but didn't pick it up as it seems to be still
 collecting review comments.

 Expecting a reroll.
 ($gmane/272180).

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/cat-file-batch-all (2015-06-26) 8 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-07-10 at 80200cc)

 "cat-file" learned "--batch-all-objects" option to enumerate all
 available objects in the repository more quickly than "rev-list
 --all --objects" (the output includes unreachable objects, though).

 Will merge to 'master'.

* mh/replace-refs (2015-06-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-06-24 at cb13adf)
 + Allow to control where the replace refs are looked for

 Add an environment variable to tell Git to look into refs hierarchy
 other than refs/replace/ for the object replacement data.


* gp/status-rebase-i-info (2015-07-06) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-07-10 at b121298)
 + status: add new tests for status during rebase -i
 + status: give more information during rebase -i
 + status: differentiate interactive from non-interactive rebases
 + status: factor two rebase-related messages together

 Teach "git status" to show a more detailed information regarding
 the "rebase -i" session in progress.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* mk/utf8-no-iconv-warn (2015-06-08) 1 commit
 - utf8.c: print warning about disabled iconv

 Warn when a reencoding is requested in a build without iconv
 support, as the end user is likely to get an unexpected result.  I
 think the same level of safety should be added to a build with
 iconv support when the specified encoding is not available, but the
 patch does not go there.

 Expecting a reroll.


* mr/rebase-i-customize-insn-sheet (2015-06-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-07-10 at ec383cd)
 + git-rebase--interactive.sh: add config option for custom instruction format

 "git rebase -i"'s list of todo is made configurable.

 Will merge to 'master'.

* rl/send-email-aliases (2015-07-07) 10 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-07-09 at c60553d)
 + send-email: suppress meaningless whitespaces in from field
 + send-email: allow multiple emails using --cc, --to and --bcc
 + send-email: consider quote as delimiter instead of character
 + send-email: reduce dependencies impact on parse_address_line
 + send-email: minor code refactoring
 + send-email: allow use of aliases in the From field of --compose mode
 + send-email: refactor address list process
 + t9001-send-email: refactor header variable fields replacement
 + send-email: allow aliases in patch header and command script outputs
 + t9001-send-email: move script creation in a setup test

 "git send-email" now performs alias-expansion on names that are
 given via --cccmd, etc.

 This round comes with a lot more enhanced e-mail address parser,
 which makes it a bit scary, but as long as it works as designed, it
 makes it wonderful ;-).

 Will merge to 'master'.


* wp/sha1-name-negative-match (2015-06-08) 2 commits
 - sha1_name.c: introduce '^{/!-<negative pattern>}' notation
 - test for '!' handling in rev-parse's named commits

 Introduce "branch^{/!-<pattern>}" notation to name a commit
 reachable from branch that does not match the given pattern.

 Expecting a reroll.


* bc/object-id (2015-06-17) 10 commits
 . remote.c: use struct object_id in many functions
 . object-id: use struct object_id in struct object
 . remote.c: use struct object_id in ref_newer()

 . connect.c: use struct object_id in get_remote_heads()
 . remote-curl: use struct object_id in parse_fetch()
 . fetch-pack: use struct object_id in add_sought_entry_mem()
 . object_id: convert struct ref to use object_id.
 . sha1_file: introduce has_object_file() helper
 . refs: convert some internal functions to use object_id

 More transition from "unsigned char[40]" to "struct object_id".

 While GSoC and other topics are actively moving existing code
 around, this cannot go in; ejected from 'pu'.


* jk/log-missing-default-HEAD (2015-06-03) 1 commit
 - log: diagnose empty HEAD more clearly

 "git init empty && git -C empty log" said "bad default revision 'HEAD'",
 which was found to be a bit confusing to new users.

 What's the status of this one?


* gr/rebase-i-drop-warn (2015-06-30) 3 commits
 - git rebase -i: add static check for commands and SHA-1
 - git rebase -i: warn about removed commits
 - git-rebase -i: add command "drop" to remove a commit

 Add "drop commit-object-name subject" command as another way to
 skip replaying of a commit in "rebase -i", and then punish those
 who do not use it (and instead just remove the lines) by throwing
 a warning.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jh/strbuf-read-use-read-in-full (2015-06-01) 1 commit
 - strbuf_read(): skip unnecessary strbuf_grow() at eof

 Avoid one extra iteration and strbuf_grow() of 8kB in
 strbuf_read().

 Looked reasonable; perhaps a log message clarification is needed.

 Expecting a reroll.


* mg/index-read-error-messages (2015-06-01) 2 commits
 - messages: uniform error messages for index write
 - show-index: uniform error messages for index read

 The tip was RFC.
 Expecting a reroll.


* hv/submodule-config (2015-06-15) 4 commits
 - do not die on error of parsing fetchrecursesubmodules option
 - use new config API for worktree configurations of submodules
 - extract functions for submodule config set and lookup
 - implement submodule config API for lookup of .gitmodules values

 The gitmodules API accessed from the C code learned to cache stuff
 lazily.

 Needs another reroll? ($gmane/273743).


* jc/push-tags-also (2015-05-29) 1 commit
 - push --tags: push tags *in addition to* other stuff

 "git fetch --tags" learned to fetch tags in addition to other stuff
 a few years ago, but "git push --tags" didn't.  Now it does.

 A change to push out more than before always invites "what if the
 user makes a mistake" worries.

 Will discard.


* jc/commit-slab (2015-05-22) 1 commit
 - commit-slab: introduce slabname##_peek() function

 Memory use reduction when commit-slab facility is used to annotate
 sparsely (which is not recommended in the first place).

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jc/clone-bundle (2015-04-30) 1 commit
 - repack: optionally create a clone.bundle

 Waiting for further work.
 Still an early WIP.

  (merged to 'next' on 2015-06-29 at d595659)
 + read_gitfile_gently: fix use-after-free
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-06-24 at 7c27821)
 + clean: improve performance when removing lots of directories
 + p7300: add performance tests for clean
 + t7300: add tests to document behavior of clean and nested git
 + setup: sanity check file size in read_gitfile_gently
 + setup: add gentle version of read_gitfile

 Replace "is this subdirectory a separate repository that should not
 be touched?" check "git clean" does by checking if it has .git/HEAD
 using the submodule-related code with a more optimized check.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/merge-drop-old-syntax (2015-04-29) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-05-28 at 6bfd8b9)
 + merge: drop 'git merge <message> HEAD <commit>' syntax

 Stop supporting "git merge <message> HEAD <commit>" syntax that
 has been deprecated since October 2007.

 Will keep in 'next' during the 2.5 cycle.
