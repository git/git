What's cooking in git.git (Mar 2020, #01; Tue, 3)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

2.26-rc0 is planned to happen tomorrow (see tinyurl.com/gitCal).
The set of remaining topics in 'next' has been shrinking and today
may be a good cut-off point to declare that anything that is not in
'next' isn't expected to ship with the 2.26 release, unless it is an
obvious regression fix.  That does not mean everything in 'next'
today will be in the release, either.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

[Graduated to "master"]

* ak/test-log-graph (2020-02-24) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-25 at 2b68666ffa)
 + lib-log-graph: consolidate colored graph cmp logic
 + lib-log-graph: consolidate test_cmp_graph logic

 Test update.


* ds/partial-clone-fixes (2020-02-22) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-25 at a26434bb7a)
 + partial-clone: avoid fetching when looking for objects
 + partial-clone: demonstrate bugs in partial fetch

 Fix for a bug revealed by a recent change to make the protocol v2
 the default.


* en/check-ignore (2020-02-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-22 at f05a752211)
 + check-ignore: fix documentation and implementation to match

 "git check-ignore" did not work when the given path is explicitly
 marked as not ignored with a negative entry in the .gitignore file.


* en/rebase-backend (2020-02-16) 20 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-22 at cae5eb0f18)
 + rebase: rename the two primary rebase backends
 + rebase: change the default backend from "am" to "merge"
 + rebase: make the backend configurable via config setting
 + rebase tests: repeat some tests using the merge backend instead of am
 + rebase tests: mark tests specific to the am-backend with --am
 + rebase: drop '-i' from the reflog for interactive-based rebases
 + git-prompt: change the prompt for interactive-based rebases
 + rebase: add an --am option
 + rebase: move incompatibility checks between backend options a bit earlier
 + git-rebase.txt: add more details about behavioral differences of backends
 + rebase: allow more types of rebases to fast-forward
 + t3432: make these tests work with either am or merge backends
 + rebase: fix handling of restrict_revision
 + rebase: make sure to pass along the quiet flag to the sequencer
 + rebase, sequencer: remove the broken GIT_QUIET handling
 + t3406: simplify an already simple test
 + rebase (interactive-backend): fix handling of commits that become empty
 + rebase (interactive-backend): make --keep-empty the default
 + t3404: directly test the behavior of interest
 + git-rebase.txt: update description of --allow-empty-message

 "git rebase" has learned to use the merge backend (i.e. the
 machinery that drives "rebase -i") by default, while allowing
 "--apply" option to use the "apply" backend (e.g. the moral
 equivalent of "format-patch piped to am").  The rebase.backend
 configuration variable can be set to customize.


* en/t3433-rebase-stat-dirty-failure (2020-02-19) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-25 at 000d596d4c)
 + merge-recursive: fix the refresh logic in update_file_flags
 + t3433: new rebase testcase documenting a stat-dirty-like failure

 The merge-recursive machinery failed to refresh the cache entry for
 a merge result in a couple of places, resulting in an unnecessary
 merge failure, which has been fixed.


* es/worktree-cleanup (2020-02-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-25 at 59bc458bcd)
 + worktree: drop unused code from get_main_worktree()

 Code cleanup.


* jk/doc-diff-parallel (2020-02-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-19 at 62b2264fca)
 + doc-diff: use single-colon rule in rendering Makefile

 Update to doc-diff.


* jk/object-filter-with-bitmap (2020-02-18) 16 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-19 at d38487e23d)
 + rev-list --count: comment on the use of count_right++
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-16 at 42425c3658)
 + pack-objects: support filters with bitmaps
 + pack-bitmap: implement BLOB_LIMIT filtering
 + pack-bitmap: implement BLOB_NONE filtering
 + bitmap: add bitmap_unset() function
 + rev-list: use bitmap filters for traversal
 + pack-bitmap: basic noop bitmap filter infrastructure
 + rev-list: allow commit-only bitmap traversals
 + t5310: factor out bitmap traversal comparison
 + rev-list: allow bitmaps when counting objects
 + rev-list: make --count work with --objects
 + rev-list: factor out bitmap-optimized routines
 + pack-bitmap: refuse to do a bitmap traversal with pathspecs
 + rev-list: fallback to non-bitmap traversal when filtering
 + pack-bitmap: fix leak of haves/wants object lists
 + pack-bitmap: factor out type iterator initialization

 The object reachability bitmap machinery and the partial cloning
 machinery were not prepared to work well together, because some
 object-filtering criteria that partial clones use inherently rely
 on object traversal, but the bitmap machinery is an optimization
 to bypass that object traversal.  There however are some cases
 where they can work together, and they were taught about them.


* jk/push-option-doc-markup-fix (2020-02-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-19 at 975e00fa99)
 + doc/config/push: use longer "--" line for preformatted example

 Doc markup fix.


* jk/run-command-formatfix (2020-02-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-25 at 39ad6eeb86)
 + run-command.h: fix mis-indented struct member

 Code style cleanup.


* ma/test-cleanup (2020-02-24) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-25 at ce00c705a9)
 + t: drop debug `cat` calls
 + t9810: drop debug `cat` call
 + t4117: check for files using `test_path_is_file`

 Code cleanup.


* rs/blame-typefix-for-fingerprint (2020-02-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-25 at 496309f50a)
 + blame: provide type of fingerprints pointer

 Code cleanup.


* rs/micro-cleanups (2020-02-24) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-25 at eaa8fd097b)
 + use strpbrk(3) to search for characters from a given set
 + quote: use isalnum() to check for alphanumeric characters

 Code cleanup.

[New Topics]

* ah/force-pull-rebase-configuration (2020-03-02) 1 commit
 . pull: warn if the user didn't say whether to rebase or to merge

 "git pull" learned to warn when no pull.rebase configuration
 exists, and neither --[no-]rebase nor --ff-only is given (which
 would result a merge).

 Needs to adjust some tests.


* hd/show-one-mergetag-fix (2020-03-02) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-03-02 at 12fe907f8d)
 + show_one_mergetag: print non-parent in hex form.

 "git show" and others gave an object name in raw format in its
 error output, which has been corrected to give it in hex.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* tg/retire-scripted-stash (2020-03-03) 2 commits
 - stash: remove the stash.useBuiltin setting
 - stash: get git_stash_config at the top level

 "git stash" has kept an escape hatch to use the scripted version
 for a few releases, which got stale.  It has been removed.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* es/outside-repo-errmsg-hints (2020-03-03) 1 commit
 - prefix_path: show gitdir if worktree unavailable

 An earlier update to show the location of working tree in the error
 message did not consider the possibility that a git command may be
 run in a bare repository, which has been corrected.

 May want a test or two.


* rs/show-progress-in-dumb-http-fetch (2020-03-03) 1 commit
 - remote-curl: show progress for fetches over dumb HTTP

 "git fetch" over HTTP walker protocol did not show any progress
 output.  We inherently do not know how much work remains, but still
 we can show something not to bore users.

 Will merge to 'next'.

* tb/commit-graph-split-merge (2020-02-12) 3 commits
 - builtin/commit-graph.c: support '--input=none'
 - builtin/commit-graph.c: introduce '--input=<source>'
 - builtin/commit-graph.c: support '--split[=<strategy>]'

 The code to write out the commit-graph has been taught a few
 options to control if the resulting graph chains should be merged
 or a single new incremental graph is created.

 Waiting for the discussion to settle.
 cf. <20200212205028.GE4364@syl.local>


* bk/p4-pre-edit-changelist (2020-02-14) 7 commits
 - git-p4: add RCS keyword status message
 - git-p4: add p4 submit hooks
 - git-p4: restructure code in submit
 - git-p4: add --no-verify option
 - git-p4: add p4-pre-submit exit text
 - git-p4: create new function run_git_hook
 - git-p4: rewrite prompt to be Windows compatible

 "git p4" learned four new hooks and also "--no-verify" option to
 bypass them (and the existing "p4-pre-submit" hook).

 Waiting for response to RFH from Windows/Python folks.

 - dir: replace exponential algorithm with a linear one
 - dir: refactor treat_directory to clarify control flow
 - dir: fix confusion based on variable tense
 - dir: fix broken comment
 - dir: consolidate treat_path() and treat_one_path()

 The directory traversal code had redundant recursive calls which
 made its performance characteristics exponential with respect to
 the depth of the tree, which was corrected.

 Expecting an update.

* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2018-10-15) 1 commit
 - zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

 Handling of conflicting renames in merge-recursive have further

* js/https-proxy-config (2020-02-27) 2 commits
 - config: documentation for HTTPS proxy client cert.
 - http: add client cert for HTTPS proxies.

 A handful of options to configure SSL when talking to proxies have

 Not enough review.  Addition of on-disk key looks wrong.


* rs/commit-graph-code-simplification (2020-02-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-27 at f298c6ed49)
 + commit-graph: use progress title directly

 Code simplfication.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/doc-single-h-is-for-help (2020-02-27) 1 commit
 - Documentation: clarify that `-h` alone stands for `help`

 Both "git ls-remote -h" and "git grep -h" give short usage help,
 like any other Git subcommand, but it is not unreasonable to expect
 that the former would behave the same as "git ls-remote --head"
 (there is no other sensible behaviour for the latter).  The
 documentation has been updated in an attempt to clarify this.


* hi/gpg-use-check-signature (2020-02-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-03-02 at 273fb30874)
 + Revert "gpg-interface: prefer check_signature() for GPG verification"

 "git merge signed-tag" while lacking the public key started to say
 "No signature", which was utterly wrong.  This regression has been
 reverted.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* rt/format-zero-length-fix (2020-02-28) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-03-02 at a4070ef573)
 + config.mak.dev: re-enable -Wformat-zero-length
 + rebase-interactive.c: silence format-zero-length warnings

 Recently we inadvertently added a few instances of using 0-width
 format string to functions that we mark as printf-like without any
 developers noticing.  The root cause was that the compiler warning
 that is triggered by this is almost always useless and we disabled
 the warning in our developer builds, but not for general public.
 The new instances have been corrected, and the warning has been
 resurrected in the developer builds.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* pw/advise-rebase-skip (2019-12-06) 9 commits
 - rebase -i: leave CHERRY_PICK_HEAD when there are conflicts
 - rebase: fix advice when a fixup creates an empty commit
 - commit: give correct advice for empty commit during a rebase
 - commit: encapsulate determine_whence() for sequencer
 - commit: use enum value for multiple cherry-picks
 - sequencer: write CHERRY_PICK_HEAD for reword and edit
 - cherry-pick: check commit error messages
 - cherry-pick: add test for `--skip` advice in `git commit`
 - t3404: use test_cmp_rev

 The mechanism to prevent "git commit" from making an empty commit
 or amending during an interrupted cherry-pick was broken during the
 rewrite of "git rebase" in C, which has been corrected.

 Will discard the tip two, which are still RFC, and advance the rest.

 The "--fork-point" mode of "git rebase" regressed when the command

 + am: convert "resume" variable to a struct
 + parse-options: convert "command mode" to a flag
 + parse-options: add testcases for OPT_CMDMODE()

 "git am --short-current-patch" is a way to show the piece of e-mail
 for the stopped step, which is not suitable to directly feed "git

 new option to show only the patch part.

* jc/describe-misnamed-annotated-tag (2020-02-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-03-02 at b4e2ca6a46)
 + describe: force long format for a name based on a mislocated tag

 When "git describe C" finds an annotated tag with tagname A to be
 the best name to explain commit C, and the tag is stored in a
 "wrong" place in the refs/tags hierarchy, e.g. refs/tags/B, the
 command gave a warning message but used A (not B) to describe C.
 If C is exactly at the tag, the describe output would be "A", but
 "git rev-parse A^0" would not be equal as "git rev-parse C^0".  The
 behavior of the command has been changed to use the "long" form
 i.e. A-0-gOBJECTNAME, which is correctly interpreted by rev-parse.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 - hex: add functions to parse hex object IDs in any algorithm
 - hex: introduce parsing variants taking hash algorithms
 - hash: implement and use a context cloning function
 - builtin/pack-objects: make hash agnostic

 SHA-256 transition continues.

 Tentatively I dropped the bits about signed tag, as it depended on
 a reverted change to the gpg interface API.

  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-27 at 4b0009b609)
 + rebase: refuse to switch to branch already checked out elsewhere
 + t3400: make test clean up after itself

 "git rebase BASE BRANCH" rebased/updated the tip of BRANCH and

 + worktree: don't allow "add" validation to be fooled by suffix matching
 + worktree: add utility to find worktree by pathname
 + worktree: improve find_worktree() documentation

 In rare cases "git worktree add <path>" could think that <path>
 was already a registered worktree even when it wasn't and refuse
 to add the new worktree. This has been corrected.

 + receive.denyCurrentBranch: respect all worktrees
 + t5509: use a bare repository for test push target
 + get_main_worktree(): allow it to be called in the Git directory

 "git push" should stop from updating a branch that is checked out
 when receive.denyCurrentBranch configuration is set, but it failed
 to pay attention to checkouts in secondary worktrees.  This has
 been corrected.

 + describe: don't abort too early when searching tags

 "git describe" in a repository with multiple root commits sometimes
 gave up looking for the best tag to describe a given commit with
 too early, which has been adjusted.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 - advice: extract vadvise() from advise()

 Revamping of the advise API to allow more systematic enumeration of
 advice knobs in the future.

 . Reftable support for git-core
 . Add reftable library
 . reftable: file format documentation
 . refs: document how ref_iterator_advance_fn should handle symrefs
 . create .git/refs in files-backend.c
 . refs.h: clarify reflog iteration order

 A new refs backend "reftable" to replace the traditional
 combination of packed-refs files and one-file-per-ref loose refs
 has been implemented and integrated for improved performance and
 atomicity.

 Temporarily ejected as this unfortunately conflicts with the
 SHA-256 topic.

 - help: move list_config_help to builtin/help

 The "bugreport" tool.

 This round has narrowed its scope significantly, and IMHO should be
 easier to review.

 - (bytesex breakage band-aid)
 - commit-graph: add GIT_TEST_COMMIT_GRAPH_CHANGED_PATHS test flag
 - revision.c: use Bloom filters to speed up path based revision walks
 - commit-graph: add --changed-paths option to write subcommand
 - commit-graph: reuse existing Bloom filters during write.
 - commit-graph: write Bloom filters to commit graph file
 - commit-graph: examine commits by generation number
 - commit-graph: examine changed-path objects in pack order
 - commit-graph: compute Bloom filters for changed paths
 - diff: halt tree-diff early after max_changes
 - bloom: core Bloom filter implementation for changed paths
 - commit-graph: use MAX_NUM_CHUNKS

 Introduce an extension to the commit-graph to make it efficient to
 check for the paths that were modified at each commit using Bloom
 filters.

 Will be rerolled with bytesex fixes squashed in.
 Breakage due to byte-order dependency reported.

 . describe: output tag's ref instead of embedded name

 When "git describe C" finds an annotated tag with tagname A to be
 the best name to explain commit C, and the tag is stored in a
 "wrong" place in the refs/tags hierarchy, e.g. refs/tags/B, the
 command gave a warning message but used A (not B) to describe C.
 If C is exactly at the tag, the describe output would be "A", but
 "git rev-parse A^0" would not be equal as "git rev-parse C^0".  The
 behavior of the command has been changed to use "B" to describe C
 instead.

 This is not the only possible approach for the issue, and it is
 unknown if the proposed solution is the best one.
