What's cooking in git.git (Mar 2012, #01; Thu, 1)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches of the
repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* jc/maint-diff-patch-header (2012-03-01) 4 commits
 - diff --ignore-mode-change
 - diff -p: squelch "diff --git" header for stat-dirty paths
 - t4011: illustrate "diff-index -p" on stat-dirty paths
 - t4011: modernise style

The last one is entirely optional as its utility is unknown, but
the first three fixes a long-standing corner case buglet.

* jk/symbolic-ref-short (2012-02-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-02-28 at d00f766)
 + symbolic-ref --short: abbreviate the output unambiguously

"git symbolic-ref" learned the "--short" option to abbreviate the refname
it shows unambiguously.

* nd/optim-connected (2012-02-29) 1 commit
 - Perform cheaper connectivity check when pack is used as medium

* tr/maint-bundle-boundary (2012-03-01) 3 commits
 - bundle: keep around names passed to add_pending_object()
 - t5510: ensure we stay in the toplevel test dir
 - t5510: refactor bundle->pack conversion

* nd/threaded-index-pack (2012-02-28) 2 commits
 . index-pack: support multithreaded delta resolving
 . index-pack: split second pass obj handling into own function

Produces a corrupt pack.  Will discard.

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* cn/maint-branch-with-bad (2012-02-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-02-28 at a37929e)
 + branch: don't assume the merge filter ref exists

"git branch --with $that" assumed incorrectly that the user will never
ask the question with nonsense value in $that.

* cn/maint-rev-list-doc (2012-02-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-02-28 at f21c627)
 + Documentation: use {asterisk} in rev-list-options.txt when needed

Documentation fix.

* jb/required-filter (2012-02-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-02-26 at e9ba88a)
 + Add a setting to require a filter to be successful

A content filter used to be a way to make the recorded contents "more
useful", but this defines a way to optionally mark a filter "required".

* jn/maint-gitweb-invalid-regexp (2012-02-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-02-28 at 6789570)
 + gitweb: Handle invalid regexp in regexp search

An invalid regular expression pattern given by an end user made "gitweb"
to return garbled response.

* nd/maint-verify-objects (2012-02-28) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-02-28 at a5e9b09)
 + rev-list: fix --verify-objects --quiet becoming --objects
 + rev-list: remove BISECT_SHOW_TRIED flag

"git rev-list --verify-objects -q" omitted the extra verification it
needs to do over "git rev-list --objects -q" by mistake.

* ph/cherry-pick-advice-refinement (2012-02-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-02-26 at 1c930c3)
 + cherry-pick: No advice to commit if --no-commit

The advice given by a conflicted "cherry-pick --no-commit" told the user
to make a commit after resolving conflicts.

* pj/completion-remote-set-url-branches (2012-02-22) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-02-26 at 0062008)
 + completion: normalize increment/decrement style
 + completion: remote set-* <name> and <branch>

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* jc/diff-ignore-case (2012-02-28) 6 commits
 . diff: -i is "--ignore-case" but means a bit more in "log"
 . diff: --ignore-case
 . xdiff: introduce XDF_IGNORE_CASE
 . xdiff: introduce XDF_INEXACT_MATCH
 . xdiff: PATIENCE/HISTOGRAM are not independent option bits
 . xdiff: remove XDL_PATCH_* macros

"git diff" learns "--ignore-case" option.
Will discard, as nobody seems to need this.

* jl/maint-submodule-relative (2012-02-09) 2 commits
 - submodules: always use a relative path from gitdir to work tree
 - submodules: always use a relative path to gitdir

The second one looked iffy.

* hv/submodule-recurse-push (2012-02-13) 3 commits
 - push: teach --recurse-submodules the on-demand option
 - Refactor submodule push check to use string list instead of integer
 - Teach revision walking machinery to walk multiple times sequencially

The bottom one was not clearly explained and needs a reroll.

* jc/advise-push-default (2011-12-18) 1 commit
 - push: hint to use push.default=upstream when appropriate

Peff had a good suggestion outlining an updated code structure so that
somebody new can try to dip his or her toes in the development. Any
takers?

* ss/git-svn-prompt-sans-terminal (2012-01-04) 3 commits
 - fixup! 15eaaf4
 - git-svn, perl/Git.pm: extend Git::prompt helper for querying users
 - perl/Git.pm: "prompt" helper to honor GIT_ASKPASS and SSH_ASKPASS

The bottom one has been replaced with a rewrite based on comments from
Ævar. The second one needs more work, both in perl/Git.pm and prompt.c, to
give precedence to tty over SSH_ASKPASS when terminal is available.

* jc/split-blob (2012-02-23) 7 commits
 - fixup?
 - chunked-object: streaming checkout
 - chunked-object: fallback checkout codepaths
 - bulk-checkin: support chunked-object encoding
 - bulk-checkin: allow the same data to be multiply hashed
 - new representation types in the packstream
 - varint-in-pack: refactor varint encoding/decoding

Not ready.

I finished the streaming checkout codepath, but as explained in 127b177
(bulk-checkin: support chunked-object encoding, 2011-11-30), these are
still early steps of a long and painful journey. At least pack-objects and
fsck need to learn the new encoding for the series to be usable locally,
and then index-pack/unpack-objects needs to learn it to be used remotely.

Given that I heard a lot of noise that people want large files, and that I
was asked by somebody at GitTogether'11 privately for an advice on how to
pay developers (not me) to help adding necessary support, I am somewhat
dissapointed that the original patch series that was sent almost two
months ago still remains here without much comments and updates from the
developer community. I even made the interface to the logic that decides
where to split chunks easily replaceable, and I deliberately made the
logic in the original patch extremely stupid to entice others, especially
the "bup" fanboys, to come up with a better logic, thinking that giving
people an easy target to shoot for, they may be encouraged to help
out. The plan is not working :-(.

[Cooking]

* jc/pickaxe-ignore-case (2012-02-28) 2 commits
 - pickaxe: allow -i to search in patch case-insensitively
 - grep: use static trans-case table

"git log -G/-S" pays attention to the "-i" option.

* rs/no-no-no-parseopt (2012-02-28) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-02-29 at 94e60d0)
 + parse-options: remove PARSE_OPT_NEGHELP
 + parse-options: allow positivation of options starting, with no-
 + test-parse-options: convert to OPT_BOOL()

Options that use PARSE_OPT_NEGHELP needed to word their help text in
a strange way, and this gets rid of the uses of them.

* jc/am-3-nonstandard-popt (2012-02-26) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-02-26 at 62a6ddf)
 + test: "am -3" can accept non-standard -p<num>
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-02-26 at 1363bd6)
 + am -3: allow nonstandard -p<num> option

The code to synthesize the fake ancestor tree used by 3-way merge
fallback in "git am" was not prepared to read a patch created with
a non-standard -p<num> value.

* cb/fsck-squelch-dangling (2012-02-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-02-29 at 9057e12)
 + fsck: --no-dangling omits "dangling object" information

I've butchered Clemens's patch and added "--no-dangling", and reverted
the part that flips the default.  I also took the authorship blame, as
I do not share the final goal with him, but our first steps should be
in the same direction, which is this patch.

* zj/diff-stat-dyncol (2012-03-01) 10 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-03-01 at 79b4152)
 + diff --stat: add config option to limit graph width
 + diff --stat: enable limiting of the graph part
 + diff --stat: add a test for output with COLUMNS=40
 + diff --stat: use a maximum of 5/8 for the filename part
 + merge --stat: use the full terminal width
 + log --stat: use the full terminal width
 + show --stat: use the full terminal width
 + diff --stat: use the full terminal width
 + diff --stat: tests for long filenames and big change counts
 + Merge branches zj/decimal-width, zj/term-columns and jc/diff-stat-scaler

Rerolled again and looking good.

* nd/columns (2012-02-28) 10 commits
 - tag: add --column
 - column: support piping stdout to external git-column process
 - status: add --column
 - branch: add --column
 - help: reuse print_columns() for help -a
 - column: add column.ui for default column output settings
 - column: add dense layout support
 - column: add columnar layout
 - Stop starting pager recursively
 - Add git-column for columnar display

Rerolled, but the configuration handling looked iffy.

* th/git-diffall (2012-02-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-02-28 at 4ba7a15)
 + contrib: add git-diffall script

A sample script that drives an external tool that compares two
directories, by populating two temporary directories with contents of
two revisions in Git.

* jn/gitweb-hilite-regions (2012-02-26) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-02-28 at 3244f30)
 + gitweb: Highlight matched part of shortened project description
 + gitweb: Highlight matched part of project description when searching projects
 + gitweb: Highlight matched part of project name when searching projects
 + gitweb: Introduce esc_html_match_hl and esc_html_hl_regions

Project search in "gitweb" shows the substring that matched in the project
name and description highlighted. The highlighting logic is meant to be
reused later for other kinds of searches e.g. grep and commit log search.
