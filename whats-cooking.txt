What's cooking in git.git (Oct 2025, #08; Thu, 23)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and
aren't considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL
to a message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity (of course they can be resubmit when new interests
arise).

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-scm/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/

 + diff: make sure the other caller of diff_flush_patch_quietly() is silent
 (this branch is used by ly/diff-name-only-with-diff-from-content; uses jk/diff-from-contents-fix.)

 The code to squelch output from "git diff -w --name-status"
 etc. for paths that "git diff -w -p" would have stayed silent
 leaked output from dry-run patch generation, which has been
 corrected.

  (merged to 'next' on 2025-10-23 at 9642f0746a)
 + t7528: work around ETOOMANY in OpenSSH 10.1 and newer

 Recent OpenSSH creates the Unix domain socket to communicate with
 ssh-agent under $HOME instead of /tmp, which causes our test to
 fail doe to overly long pathname in our test environment, which has
 been worked around by using "ssh-agent -T".
