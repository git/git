What's cooking in git.git (Aug 2019, #04; Wed, 14)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

We have a handful of topics in 'next', but as far as I can tell,
there is not anything that is so urgent and needs to go in the
upcoming release.  Hence the upcoming 2.23 release would hopefully
be pretty much the same as the tip of the 'master' as of today.

Unless we find something else that is glaringly wrong there in the
next few days, that is.  But in such a case it is likely we'd need
to delay the release to deal with the issue.  Let's hope there isn't
such a serious regression.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

 - Merge branch 'py/call-do-quit-before-exit' of github.com:gitster/git-gui into py/git-gui-do-quit
 - git-gui: call do_quit before destroying the main window

 "git gui" learned to call the clean-up procedure before exiting.

 Will merge to 'next'.

  (merged to 'next' on 2019-08-14 at 3010a7d19f)
 + t/perf: rename duplicate-numbered test script

 Test & perf scripts must use unique numeric prefix, but a pair
 shared the same number, which is fixed here.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* en/fast-import-merge-doc (2019-08-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-08-14 at 65efc63345)
 + git-fast-import.txt: clarify that multiple merge commits are allowed

 Doc update.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* bc/reread-attributes-during-rebase (2019-08-13) 3 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - apply: reload .gitattributes after patching it
 - path: add a function to check for path suffix

 The "git am" based backend of "git rebase" ignored the result of
 updating ".gitattributes" done in one step when replaying
 subsequent steps.

 Will squash the tip commit in and then merge to 'next'.


* jk/drop-release-pack-memory (2019-08-13) 1 commit
 - packfile: drop release_pack_memory()

 xmalloc() used to have a mechanism to ditch memory and address
 space resources as the last resort upon seeing an allocation
 failure from the underlying malloc(), which made the code complex
 and thread-unsafe with dubious benefit, as major memory resource
 users already do limit their uses with various other mechanisms.
 It has been simplified away.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sg/complete-configuration-variables (2019-08-13) 11 commits
 - completion: complete config variables and values for 'git clone --config='

 - object-store: add lock to read_object_file_extended()


* pd/fetch-jobs (2019-08-13) 5 commits
 . fetch: make --jobs control submodules and remotes
 . fetch: add the --submodule-fetch-jobs option
 . fetch: add the fetch.jobs config key
 . fetch: add the "--fetch-jobs" option
 . fetch: rename max_children to max_children_for_submodules

 "git fetch --jobs" is getting taught to also run fetch jobs in
 parallel when fetching from multiple remote repositories.


* cb/fetch-set-upstream (2019-08-14) 1 commit
 - pull, fetch: add --set-upstream option

 "git fetch" learned "--set-upstream" option to help those who first
 clone from their private fork they intend to push to, add the true
 upstream via "git remote add" and then "git fetch" from it.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* js/trace2-json-schema (2019-07-25) 3 commits
 . ci: run trace2 schema validation in the CI suite
 . trace2: add a schema validator for trace2 events
 . trace2: add a JSON schema for trace2 events

 The JSON output produced by "trace2" subsystem now has JSON schema
 defined on it, to allow us validate the output and catch deviation.

 The CI integration may be a bit too heavy-handed.


* jn/unknown-index-extensions (2018-11-21) 2 commits
 - index: offer advice for unknown index extensions
 - index: do not warn about unrecognized extensions

 A bit too alarming warning given when unknown index extensions
 exist is getting revamped.

 Expecting a reroll.


* jc/format-patch-delay-message-id (2019-04-05) 1 commit
 - format-patch: move message-id and related headers to the end

 The location "git format-patch --thread" adds the Message-Id:
 header in the series of header fields has been moved down, which
 may help working around a suspected bug in GMail MSA, reported at
 <CAHk-=whP1stFZNAaJiMi5eZ9rj0MRt20Y_yHVczZPH+O01d+sA@mail.gmail.com>

 Waiting for feedback to see if it truly helps.
 Needs tests.


* jt/fetch-cdn-offload (2019-03-12) 9 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - upload-pack: send part of packfile response as uri
 - fetch-pack: support more than one pack lockfile
 - upload-pack: refactor reading of pack-objects out
 - Documentation: add Packfile URIs design doc
 - Documentation: order protocol v2 sections
 - http-fetch: support fetching packfiles by URL
 - http: improve documentation of http_pack_request
 - http: use --stdin when getting dumb HTTP pack

 WIP for allowing a response to "git fetch" to instruct the bulk of
 the pack contents to be instead taken from elsewhere (aka CDN).


* js/protocol-advertise-multi (2018-12-28) 1 commit
 - protocol: advertise multiple supported versions

 The transport layer has been updated so that the protocol version
 used can be negotiated between the parties, by the initiator
 listing the protocol versions it is willing to talk, and the other
 side choosing from one of them.

 Expecting a reroll.

* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2018-10-15) 1 commit
 - zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".


* dl/remote-save-to-push (2018-12-11) 1 commit
 - remote: add --save-to-push option to git remote set-url

 "git remote set-url" learned a new option that moves existing value
 of the URL field to pushURL field of the remote before replacing
 the URL field with a new value.

 Anybody who wants to champion this topic?
 I am personally not yet quite convinced if this is worth pursuing.

[Cooking]

* sg/commit-graph-validate (2019-08-05) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-08-09 at 87f61abb73)
 + commit-graph: error out on invalid commit oids in 'write --stdin-commits'
 + commit-graph: turn a group of write-related macro flags into an enum
 + t5318-commit-graph: use 'test_expect_code'

 The code to write commit-graph over given commit object names has
 been made a bit more robust.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* sg/show-failed-test-names (2019-08-05) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-08-09 at c49ece8a0d)
 + tests: show the test name and number at the start of verbose output
 + t0000-basic: use realistic test script names in the verbose tests

 The first line of verbose output from each test piece now carries
 the test name and number to help scanning with eyeballs.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* js/pre-merge-commit-hook (2019-08-07) 4 commits
 - merge: --no-verify to bypass pre-merge-commit hook
 - git-merge: honor pre-merge-commit hook
 - merge: do no-verify like commit
 - t7503: verify proper hook execution

 A new "pre-merge-commit" hook has been introduced.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/eoo (2019-08-06) 3 commits
 - gitcli: document --end-of-options
 - parse-options: allow --end-of-options as a synonym for "--"
 - revision: allow --end-of-options to end option parsing

 The command line parser learned "--end-of-options" notation; the
 standard convention for scripters to have hardcoded set of options
 first on the command line, and force the command to treat end-user
 input as non-options, has been to use "--" as the delimiter, but
 that would not work for commands that use "--" as a delimiter
 between revs and pathspec.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/repo-init-cleanup (2019-08-06) 3 commits
 - config: stop checking whether the_repository is NULL
 - common-main: delay trace2 initialization

 - grep: avoid leak of chartables in PCRE2
 - grep: make PCRE2 aware of custom allocator
 - grep: make PCRE1 aware of custom allocator

 WIP.


* jh/trace2-pretty-output (2019-08-09) 7 commits
 - trace2: cleanup whitespace in perf format
 - trace2: cleanup whitespace in normal format
 - quote: add sq_append_quote_argv_pretty()
 - trace2: trim trailing whitespace in normal format error message
 - trace2: remove dead code in maybe_add_string_va()
 - trace2: trim whitespace in region messages in perf target format
 - trace2: cleanup column alignment in perf target format

 Output from trace2 subsystem is formatted more prettily now.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sc/pack-refs-deletion-racefix (2019-08-02) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-08-09 at 6bd6c85fbb)
 + pack-refs: always refresh after taking the lock file

 "git pack-refs" can lose refs that are created while running, which
 is getting corrected.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* vn/restore-empty-ita-corner-case-fix (2019-08-02) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-08-09 at ad2d7630d1)
 + restore: add test for deleted ita files
 + checkout.c: unstage empty deleted ita files

 "git checkout" and "git restore" to re-populate the index from a
 tree-ish (typically HEAD) did not work correctly for a path that
 was removed and then added again with the intent-to-add bit, when
 the corresponding working tree file was empty.  This has been
 corrected.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* ds/feature-macros (2019-08-13) 6 commits
 - repo-settings: create feature.experimental setting
 - repo-settings: create feature.manyFiles setting
 - repo-settings: parse core.untrackedCache

  (merged to 'next' on 2019-08-02 at e1a46a195f)
 + grep: fix worktree case in submodules

 "git grep --recurse-submodules" that looks at the working tree
 files looked at the contents in the index in submodules, instead of
 files in the working tree.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* jk/tree-walk-overflow (2019-08-01) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-08-02 at 116467c77a)

 + t5703: run all non-httpd-specific tests before sourcing 'lib-httpd.sh'
 + t5510-fetch: run non-httpd-specific test before sourcing 'lib-httpd.sh'
 (this branch uses sg/t5510-test-i18ngrep-fix.)

 Test fix.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* vn/reset-deleted-ita (2019-07-26) 1 commit
 - reset: unstage empty deleted ita files

 "git reset HEAD [<pathspec>]" did not reset an empty file that was
 added with the intent-to-add bit.

 - sequencer: rename amend_author to author_to_rename
 - rebase -i: support --committer-date-is-author-date
 - sequencer: add NULL checks under read_author_script
 - rebase -i: add --ignore-whitespace flag

 "git rebase -i" learned a few options that are known by "git
 rebase" proper.

 Almost there.

 - t3400: stop referring to the scripted rebase
 - Drop unused git-rebase--am.sh

 "git rebase --rebase-merges" learned to drive different merge
 strategies and pass strategy specific options to them.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 + log tests: test regex backends in "--encode=<enc>" tests
 (this branch is used by ab/pcre-jit-fixes.)

 Retire use of kwset library, which is an optimization for looking
 for fixed strings, with use of pcre2 JIT.

 Kicked out of 'next' to give the topic a chance to get rebooted.


* ab/pcre-jit-fixes (2019-07-26) 7 commits
 - grep: do not enter PCRE2_UTF mode on fixed matching
 - grep: stess test PCRE v2 on invalid UTF-8 data

* jc/format-patch-noclobber (2019-02-22) 1 commit
 - format-patch: --no-clobber refrains from overwriting output files

 "git format-patch" used to overwrite an existing patch/cover-letter
 file.  A new "--no-clobber" option stops it.

 Will discard.


* dl/rebase-i-keep-base (2019-04-25) 6 commits
 - rebase: teach rebase --keep-base
 - rebase: fast-forward --fork-point in more cases
 - rebase: fast-forward --onto in more cases
 - rebase: refactor can_fast_forward into goto tower
 - t3432: test rebase fast-forward behavior
 - t3431: add rebase --fork-point tests

 "git rebase --keep-base <upstream>" tries to find the original base
 of the topic being rebased and rebase on top of that same base,
 which is useful when running the "git rebase -i" (and its limited
 variant "git rebase -x").

 The command also has learned to fast-forward in more cases where it
 can instead of replaying to recreate identical commits.

 On hold.
