What's cooking in git.git (Oct 2020, #02; Fri, 9)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'seen' (formerly 'pu'---proposed updates) while commits prefixed
with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

The first release candidate for this cycle, Git v2.29.0-rc1, has
been tagged.  This -rc1 turned out to be a bit more ambitious than
usual in how I handled young-but-small topics.  I would have left
them out, saying "their benefit is low and don't have to be in the
upcoming release", in past cycles.  But this time, I tried to cram
them in -rc1, with an updated excluse "their scope is so small that
they cannot be so wrong to delay the release even if we later find
problems in them, so there is no point in delaying".

We'll see how well it turns out.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches of the
repositories listed at

  (merged to 'next' on 2020-10-08 at 83db2c0a89)
 + ci: do not skip tagged revisions in GitHub workflows
 + ci: skip GitHub workflow runs for already-tested commits/trees

 The logic to skip testing on the tagged commit and the tag itself
 was not quite consistent which led to failure of Windows test
 tasks.  It has been revamped to consistently skip revisions that
 have already been tested, based on the tree object of the revision.

  (merged to 'next' on 2020-10-08 at c9a6bc9a54)
 + checkout: learn to respect checkout.guess

 "git checkout" learned to use checkout.guess configuration variable
 and enable/disable its "--[no-]guess" option accordingly.

 Will cook in 'next'.

  (merged to 'next' on 2020-10-08 at 807e047d68)

 same command without "-p" correctly used the merge-base between
 commits A and B.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* dl/resurrect-update-for-sha256 (2020-10-08) 2 commits
 - contrib/git-resurrect.sh: use hash-agnostic OID pattern

 "git resurrect" script (in contrib/) learned that the object names
 may be longer than 40-hex depending on the hash function in use.


* ds/commit-graph-merging-fix (2020-10-08) 1 commit
 - commit-graph: ignore duplicates when merging layers

 When "git commit-graph" detects the same commit recorded more than
 once while it is merging the layers, it used to die.  The code now
 ignores all but one of them and continues.

 Shouldn't it make sure all copies match, or discard all of them, to
 avoid random corruptions kept in the repository?


* ds/maintenance-commit-graph-auto-fix (2020-10-08) 1 commit
 - maintenance: test commit-graph auto condition

 Test-coverage enhancement of running commit-graph task "git
 maintenance" as needed led to discovery and fix of a bug.

 The commit-graph learned to use corrected commit dates instead of
 the generation number to help topological revision traversal.

 Allow the configuration to specify no abbreviation regardless of
 the hash algorithm.

 "git rev-parse" can be explicitly told to give output as absolute

 The first step to remove on-disk binaries for built-in subcommands
 by soliciting objections.

 On hold for now.


* dr/push-remoteref-fix (2020-04-23) 1 commit
 - remote.c: fix handling of %(push:remoteref)

 The "%(push:remoteref)" placeholder in the "--format=" argument of
 "git format-patch" (and friends) only showed what got explicitly
 configured, not what ref at the receiving end would be updated when
 "git push" was used, as it ignored the default behaviour (e.g. update
 the same ref as the source).

 Discard for now.

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

 - t4068: remove unnecessary >tmp

 "git diff A...B" learned "git diff --merge-base A B", which is a
 longer short-hand to say the same thing.


* sb/clone-origin (2020-09-30) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-10-06 at 7178c9af9c)
 + clone: allow configurable default for `-o`/`--origin`

  (merged to 'next' on 2020-10-04 at 09c4c1e088)
 + t, doc: update tests, reference for "--force-if-includes"
 + push: parse and set flag for "--force-if-includes"
 + push: add reflog check for "--force-if-includes"
 + Merge branch 'ds/in-merge-bases-many-optim-bug' into sk/force-if-includes

 "git push --force-with-lease[=<ref>]" can easily be misused to lose
 commits unless the user takes good care of their own "git fetch".
 A new option "--force-if-includes" attempts to ensure that what is
 being force-pushed was created after examining the commit at the
 tip of the remote ref that is about to be force-replaced.
