What's cooking in git.git (Mar 2023, #06; Wed, 29)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a future
release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and aren't
considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL to a
message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity.

The first two batches of topics are in 'master' for the next feature
release, and the tip of 'maint' now points at Git 2.40.0 to start
another maintenance track.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

* tk/pull-conflict-suggest-rebase-merge-not-rebase-true (2023-02-13) 1 commit
 - pull: conflict hint pull.rebase suggestion should offer "merges" vs "true"

 In an advice message after failed non-ff pull, we used to suggest
 setting pull.rebase=true, but these days pull.rebase=merges may be
 more inline with the original spirit of "rebuild your side on top
 of theirs".

 On hold. This is too much of a departure from the existing practice.

 Error messages given when working on an unborn branch that is
 checked out in another worktree have been improved.

 Kicked out of 'next' to replace with an updated version.

 - imap-send: replace auto-probe libcurl with hard dependency
 - imap-send doc: the imap.sslVerify is used with imap.tunnel
 - imap-send: note "auth_method", not "host" on auth method failure

 Give a hard dependency on cURL library to build "git imap-send",
 and remove the code to interact with IMAP server without using cURL.

 Expecting a reroll.
 The 'tunnel' part is still iffy.

 - SQUASH??? the test marked to expect failure passes from day one
 - checkout/switch: disallow checking out same branch in multiple worktrees

 "git checkout -B $branch" failed to protect against checking out
 a branch that is checked out elsewhere, unlike "git branch -f" did.

 Expecting a hopefully minor and final reroll.

 "cat-file" in the batch mode that is fed NUL-terminated pathnames
 learned to cquote them in its error output (otherwise, a funny
 pathname with LF in it would break the lines in the output stream).

 Breaks "cat-file --batch-all-objects --batch-check".
