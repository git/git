What's cooking in git.git (Mar 2014, #06; Tue, 25)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.

More topics merged to 'master', many of which are fallouts from GSoC
microprojects.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-17 at 7437c77)
 + Documentation/git-am: typofix
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-12 at 17c3ada)
 + Documentation/git-am: Document supported --patch-format options


* dm/configure-iconv-locale-charset (2014-03-11) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-20 at 4443bfd)
 + configure.ac: link with -liconv for locale_charset()


* jk/lib-terminal-lazy (2014-03-14) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-20 at 5de832f)
 + t/lib-terminal: make TTY a lazy prerequisite

 The test helper lib-terminal always run an actual test_expect_* when
 included, which screwed up with the use of skil-all that may have to
 be done later.


* jk/mv-submodules-fix (2014-03-17) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-17 at 7cae3b1)
 + mv: prevent mismatched data when ignoring errors.
 + builtin/mv: fix out of bounds write

 "git mv" that moves a submodule forgot to adjust the array that
 uses to keep track of which submodules were to be moved to update
 its configuration.


* jk/warn-on-object-refname-ambiguity (2014-03-13) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-17 at 3f8e98e)
 + rev-list: disable object/refname ambiguity check with --stdin
 + cat-file: restore warn_on_object_refname_ambiguity flag
 + cat-file: fix a minor memory leak in batch_objects
 + cat-file: refactor error handling of batch_objects


* mh/remove-subtree-long-pathname-fix (2014-03-13) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-17 at 68cc994)
 + entry.c: fix possible buffer overflow in remove_subtree()
 + checkout_entry(): use the strbuf throughout the function

 Length limit for the pathname used when removing a path in a deep
 subdirectory has been removed to avoid buffer overflows.


* nd/commit-editor-cleanup (2014-02-25) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-17 at 986605d)
 + commit: add --cleanup=scissors
 + wt-status.c: move cut-line print code out to wt_status_add_cut_line
 + wt-status.c: make cut_line[] const to shrink .data section a bit

 "git commit --cleanup=<mode>" learned a new mode, scissors.


* nd/indent-fix-connect-c (2014-03-13) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-17 at a109efc)
 + connect.c: SP after "}", not TAB


* nd/index-pack-error-message (2014-03-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-20 at 4d722ac)
 + index-pack: report error using the correct variable

 "git index-pack" used a wrong variable to name the keep-file in an
 error message when the file cannot be written or closed.


* rr/doc-merge-strategies (2014-03-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-20 at d31f415)
 + Documentation/merge-strategies: avoid hyphenated commands

 There were a few instances of 'git-foo' remaining in the
 documentation that should have been spelled 'git foo'.


* ss/test-on-mingw-rsync-path-no-absolute (2014-03-19) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-20 at 2b7b95d)
 + t5510: Do not use $(pwd) when fetching / pushing / pulling via rsync


* us/printf-not-echo (2014-03-18) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-20 at 41205c8)
 + test-lib.sh: do not "echo" caller-supplied strings
 + rebase -i: do not "echo" random user-supplied strings

 "rebase -i" produced a broken insn sheet when the title of a commit
 happened to contain '\n' (or ended with '\c') due to a careless use
 of 'echo'.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* jk/tests-cleanup (2014-03-21) 12 commits
 - t0001: drop subshells just for "cd"
 - t0001: drop useless subshells
 - t0001: use test_must_fail
 - t0001: use test_config_global
 - t0001: use test_path_is_*
 - t0001: make symlink reinit test more careful
 - t: prefer "git config --file" to GIT_CONFIG
 - t: prefer "git config --file" to GIT_CONFIG with test_must_fail
 - t: stop using GIT_CONFIG to cross repo boundaries
 - t: drop useless sane_unset GIT_* calls
 - t/test-lib: drop redundant unset of GIT_CONFIG
 - t/Makefile: stop setting GIT_CONFIG
 (this branch uses dt/tests-with-env-not-subshell.)

 Will merge to 'next'.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* tr/merge-recursive-index-only (2014-02-05) 3 commits
 - merge-recursive: -Xindex-only to leave worktree unchanged
 - merge-recursive: internal flag to avoid touching the worktree
 - merge-recursive: remove dead conditional in update_stages()
 (this branch is used by tr/remerge-diff.)

 Will hold.


* tr/remerge-diff (2014-02-26) 5 commits
 . log --remerge-diff: show what the conflict resolution changed
 . name-hash: allow dir hashing even when !ignore_case
 . merge-recursive: allow storing conflict hunks in index
 . revision: fold all merge diff variants into an enum merge_diff_mode
 . combine-diff: do not pass revs->dense_combined_merges redundantly
 (this branch uses tr/merge-recursive-index-only.)

 "log -p" output learns a new way to let users inspect a merge
 commit by showing the differences between the automerged result
 with conflicts the person who recorded the merge would have seen
 and the final conflict resolution that was recorded in the merge.

 RFC.  This latest round clashes with the kb/fast-hashmap topic in
 'master'.


* sz/mingw-index-pack-threaded (2014-03-19) 1 commit
 - Enable index-pack threading in msysgit.

 Still under discussion among Windows folks


* bc/blame-crlf-test (2014-02-18) 1 commit
 - blame: add a failing test for a CRLF issue.

 I have a feeling that a fix for this should be fairly isolated and
 trivial (it should be just the matter of paying attention to the
 crlf settings when synthesizing the fake commit)---perhaps somebody
 can squash in a fix to this?


* jk/makefile (2014-02-05) 16 commits
 - FIXUP
 - move LESS/LV pager environment to Makefile
 - Makefile: teach scripts to include make variables
 - FIXUP
 - Makefile: auto-build C strings from make variables
 - Makefile: drop *_SQ variables
 - FIXUP
 - Makefile: add c-quote helper function
 - Makefile: introduce sq function for shell-quoting
 - Makefile: always create files via make-var
 - Makefile: store GIT-* sentinel files in MAKE/
 - Makefile: prefer printf to echo for GIT-*
 - Makefile: use tempfile/mv strategy for GIT-*
 - Makefile: introduce make-var helper function
 - Makefile: fix git-instaweb dependency on gitweb
 - Makefile: drop USE_GETTEXT_SCHEME from GIT-CFLAGS

 Simplify the Makefile rules and macros that exist primarily for
 quoting purposes, and make it easier to robustly express the
 dependency rules.

 Expecting a reroll.


* kb/fast-hashmap-pack-struct (2014-02-24) 1 commit
 - hashmap.h: make sure map entries are tightly packed

 I am inclined to drop this; an alternative is to replace it with
 the "more portable" one that uses #pragma, which I am willing to
 try doing so on 'pu', though.


* po/everyday-doc (2014-01-27) 1 commit
 - Make 'git help everyday' work

 This may make the said command to emit something, but the source is
 not meant to be formatted into a manual pages to begin with, and
 also its contents are a bit stale.  It may be a good first step in
 the right direction, but needs more work to at least get the
 mark-up right before public consumption.

 Will hold.


* jk/branch-at-publish-rebased (2014-01-17) 5 commits
 - t1507 (rev-parse-upstream): fix typo in test title
 - implement @{publish} shorthand
 - branch_get: provide per-branch pushremote pointers
 - branch_get: return early on error
 - sha1_name: refactor upstream_mark

 Give an easier access to the tracking branches from "other" side in
 a triangular workflow by introducing B@{publish} that works in a
 similar way to how B@{upstream} does.

 Meant to be used as a basis for whatever Ram wants to build on.

 Will hold.


* rb/merge-prepare-commit-msg-hook (2014-01-10) 4 commits
 - merge: drop unused arg from abort_commit method signature
 - merge: make prepare_to_commit responsible for write_merge_state
 - t7505: ensure cleanup after hook blocks merge
 - t7505: add missing &&

 Expose more merge states (e.g. $GIT_DIR/MERGE_MODE) to hooks that
 run during "git merge".  The log message stresses too much on one
 hook, prepare-commit-msg, but it would equally apply to other hooks
 like post-merge, I think.

 Waiting for a reroll.


* jl/submodule-recursive-checkout (2013-12-26) 5 commits
 - Teach checkout to recursively checkout submodules
 - submodule: teach unpack_trees() to update submodules
 - submodule: teach unpack_trees() to repopulate submodules
 - submodule: teach unpack_trees() to remove submodule contents
 - submodule: prepare for recursive checkout of submodules

 Expecting a reroll.


* jc/graph-post-root-gap (2013-12-30) 3 commits
 - WIP: document what we want at the end
 - graph: remove unused code a bit
 - graph: stuff the current commit into graph->columns[]

 This was primarily a RFH ($gmane/239580).


* hv/submodule-ignore-fix (2013-12-06) 4 commits
 - disable complete ignorance of submodules for index <-> HEAD diff
 - always show committed submodules in summary after commit
 - teach add -f option for ignored submodules
 - fix 'git add' to skip submodules configured as ignored

 Teach "git add" to be consistent with "git status" when changes to
 submodules are set to be ignored, to avoid surprises after checking
 with "git status" to see there isn't any change to be further added
 and then see that "git add ." adds changes to them.

 I think a reroll is coming, so this may need to be replaced, but I
 needed some practice with heavy conflict resolution.  It conflicts
 with two changes to "git add" that have been scheduled for Git 2.0
 quite badly, and I think I got the resolution right this time.

 Waiting for a reroll.


* np/pack-v4 (2013-09-18) 90 commits
 . packv4-parse.c: add tree offset caching
 . t1050: replace one instance of show-index with verify-pack
 . index-pack, pack-objects: allow creating .idx v2 with .pack v4
 . unpack-objects: decode v4 trees
 . unpack-objects: allow to save processed bytes to a buffer
 - ...

 Nico and Duy advancing the eternal vaporware pack-v4.  This is here
 primarily for wider distribution of the preview edition.

 Temporarily ejected from 'pu', to try out jk/pack-bitmap, which
 this topic conflicts with.


* tg/perf-lib-test-perf-cleanup (2013-09-19) 2 commits
 - perf-lib: add test_perf_cleanup target
 - perf-lib: split starting the test from the execution

 Add test_perf_cleanup shell function to the perf suite, that allows
 the script writers to define a test with a clean-up action.

 Will hold.


* jc/format-patch (2013-04-22) 2 commits
 - format-patch: --inline-single
 - format-patch: rename "no_inline" field

 A new option to send a single patch to the standard output to be
 appended at the bottom of a message.  I personally have no need for
 this, but it was easy enough to cobble together.  Tests, docs and
 stripping out more MIMEy stuff are left as exercises to interested
 parties.


* jc/show-branch (2014-03-24) 5 commits
 - show-branch: use commit slab to represent bitflags of arbitrary width
 - show-branch.c: remove "all_mask"
 - show-branch.c: abstract out "flags" operation
 - show-branch.c: lift all_mask/all_revs to a global static
 - show-branch.c: update comment style

 Waiting for the final step to lift the hard-limit before sending it out.

[Cooking]

* ca/doc-config-third-party (2014-03-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-25 at 731e011)
 + config.txt: third-party tools may and do use their own variables

 Will merge to 'master'.


* dw/doc-status-no-longer-shows-pound-prefix (2014-03-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-25 at 2683eb6)
 + doc: status, remove leftover statement about '#' prefix

 Will merge to 'master'.


* js/userdiff-cc (2014-03-21) 10 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-25 at 8c0e585)
 + userdiff: have 'cpp' hunk header pattern catch more C++ anchor points
 + t4018: test cases showing that the cpp pattern misses many anchor points
 + t4018: test cases for the built-in cpp pattern
 + t4018: reduce test files for pattern compilation tests
 + t4018: convert custom pattern test to the new infrastructure
 + t4018: convert java pattern test to the new infrastructure
 + t4018: convert perl pattern tests to the new infrastructure
 + t4018: an infrastructure to test hunk headers
 + userdiff: support unsigned and long long suffixes of integer constants
 + userdiff: support C++ ->* and .* operators in the word regexp

 Improves the pattern to match the hunk-header for C/C++.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* dp/makefile-charset-lib-doc (2014-03-23) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-25 at b32e3ad)
 + Makefile: describe CHARSET_LIB better

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ib/rev-parse-parseopt-argh (2014-03-24) 5 commits
 - parse-options: make sure argh string does not have SP or _
 - update-index: teach --cacheinfo a new syntax "mode,sha1,path"
 - parse-options: multi-word argh should use dash to separate words
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-25 at d9083ed)
 + t1502: protect runs of SPs used in the indentation
 + rev-parse --parseopt: option argument name hints

 Teaches the "rev-parse --parseopt" mechanism used by scripted
 Porcelains to parse command line options and give help text how to
 supply argv-help (the placeholder string for an option parameter,
 e.g. "key-id" in "--gpg-sign=<key-id>").

 Will merge the bottom part to 'master'.


* rs/pickaxe-i (2014-03-24) 10 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-25 at 3b6f21f)
 + pickaxe: simplify kwset loop in contains()
 + pickaxe: call strlen only when necessary in diffcore_pickaxe_count()
 + pickaxe: move pickaxe() after pickaxe_match()
 + pickaxe: merge diffcore_pickaxe_grep() and diffcore_pickaxe_count() into diffcore_pickaxe()
 + pickaxe: honor -i when used with -S and --pickaxe-regex
 + t4209: use helper functions to test --author
 + t4209: use helper functions to test --grep
 + t4209: factor out helper function test_log_icase()
 + t4209: factor out helper function test_log()
 + t4209: set up expectations up front

 Allow the options -i/--regexp-ignore-case, --pickaxe-regex, and -S
 to be used together and work as expected to perform a pickaxe
 search using case-insensitive regular expression matching.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* an/branch-config-message (2014-03-24) 1 commit
 - branch.c: install_branch_config: simplify if chain

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ah/doc-gitk-config (2014-03-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-20 at d671b60)
 + Documentation/gitk: document the location of the configulation file

 Will merge to 'master'.


* as/grep-fullname-config (2014-03-20) 1 commit
 - grep: add grep.fullName config variable

 Will merge to 'next'.


* fr/add-interactive-argv-array (2014-03-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-20 at 9d65f3d)
 + add: use struct argv_array in run_add_interactive()

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/pack-bitmap (2014-03-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-20 at bba6246)
 + pack-objects: turn off bitmaps when skipping objects

 Instead of dying when asked to (re)pack with the reachability
 bitmap when a bitmap cannot be built, just (re)pack without
 producing a bitmap in such a case, with a warning.

 Will merge to 'master', and probably to 'maint' later.


* jk/pack-bitmap-progress (2014-03-17) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-20 at c7a83f9)
 + pack-objects: show reused packfile objects in "Counting objects"
 + pack-objects: show progress for reused packfiles

 The progress output while repacking and transferring objects showed
 an apparent large silence while writing the objects out of existing
 packfiles, when the reachability bitmap was in use.

 Will merge to 'master', and probably to 'maint' later.


* jk/subtree-prefix (2014-03-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-20 at 81367fa)
 + subtree: initialize "prefix" variable

 A stray environment variable $prefix could have leaked into and
 affected the behaviour of the "subtree" script.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* nd/gc-aggressive (2014-03-17) 4 commits
 - gc --aggressive: three phase repacking
 - gc --aggressive: make --depth configurable
 - pack-objects: support --keep
 - environment.c: fix constness for odb_pack_keep()


* bg/rebase-off-of-previous-branch (2014-03-19) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-21 at 916b759)
 + rebase: allow "-" short-hand for the previous branch

 Will merge to 'master'.


* dt/tests-with-env-not-subshell (2014-03-19) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-25 at 19fe25f)
 + tests: use "env" to run commands with temporary env-var settings
 (this branch is used by jk/tests-cleanup.)

 Will merge to 'master'.


* hs/simplify-bit-setting-in-fsck-tree (2014-03-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-25 at 08efd68)
 + fsck: use bitwise-or assignment operator to set flag

 Will merge to 'master'.


* mm/status-porcelain-format-i18n-fix (2014-03-20) 2 commits
 - SQUASH??? fix decl-after-stmt and simplify
 - status: disable translation when --porcelain is used

 Will merge to 'next' after squashing in the fixup.


* ap/remote-hg-skip-null-bookmarks (2014-03-25) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-25 at a8cd922)
 + remote-hg: do not fail on invalid bookmarks

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ys/fsck-commit-parsing (2014-03-19) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-21 at 2728983)
 + fsck.c:fsck_commit(): use skip_prefix() to verify and skip constant
 + fsck.c:fsck_ident(): ident points at a const string

 Will merge to 'master'.


* bp/commit-p-editor (2014-03-18) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-21 at 23b6b06)
 + run-command: mark run_hook_with_custom_index as deprecated
 + merge hook tests: fix and update tests
 + merge: fix GIT_EDITOR override for commit hook
 + commit: fix patch hunk editing with "commit -p -m"
 + test patch hunk editing with "commit -p -m"
 + merge hook tests: use 'test_must_fail' instead of '!'
 + merge hook tests: fix missing '&&' in test

 When it is not necessary to edit a commit log message (e.g. "git
 commit -m" is given a message without specifying "-e"), we used to
 disable the spawning of the editor by overriding GIT_EDITOR, but
 this means all the uses of the editor, other than to edit the
 commit log message, are also affected.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* cn/fetch-prune-overlapping-destination (2014-03-24) 3 commits
 - SQUASH??? style and leak fix
 - fetch: handle overlaping refspecs on --prune
 - fetch: add a failing test for prunning with overlapping refspecs

 Protect refs in a hierarchy that can come from more than one remote
 hierarcies from incorrect removal by "git fetch --prune".

 Since I didn't get any responses to my earlier "Comments?", I ended
 up reading it myself again and found a small leak.

 Hoping to be able to merge a fix for this issue soonish.


* nd/multiple-work-trees (2014-03-25) 28 commits
 - count-objects: report unused files in $GIT_DIR/repos/...
 - gc: support prune --repos
 - gc: style change -- no SP before closing bracket
 - prune: strategies for linked checkouts
 - checkout: detach if the branch is already checked out elsewhere
 - checkout: clean up half-prepared directories in --to mode
 - checkout: support checking out into a new working directory
 - use new wrapper write_file() for simple file writing
 - wrapper.c: wrapper to open a file, fprintf then close
 - setup.c: support multi-checkout repo setup
 - setup.c: detect $GIT_COMMON_DIR check_repository_format_gently()
 - setup.c: convert check_repository_format_gently to use strbuf
 - setup.c: detect $GIT_COMMON_DIR in is_git_directory()
 - setup.c: convert is_git_directory() to use strbuf
 - git-stash: avoid hardcoding $GIT_DIR/logs/....
 - *.sh: avoid hardcoding $GIT_DIR/hooks/...
 - git-sh-setup.sh: use rev-parse --git-path to get $GIT_DIR/objects
 - $GIT_COMMON_DIR: a new environment variable
 - commit: use SEQ_DIR instead of hardcoding "sequencer"
 - fast-import: use git_path() for accessing .git dir instead of get_git_dir()
 - reflog: avoid constructing .lock path with git_path
 - *.sh: respect $GIT_INDEX_FILE
 - git_path(): be aware of file relocation in $GIT_DIR
 - path.c: group git_path(), git_pathdup() and strbuf_git_path() together
 - path.c: rename vsnpath() to do_git_path()
 - git_snpath(): retire and replace with strbuf_git_path()
 - path.c: make get_pathname() call sites return const char *
 - path.c: make get_pathname() return strbuf instead of static buffer

 A replacement for contrib/workdir/git-new-workdir that does not
 rely on symbolic links and make sharing of objects and refs safer
 by making the borrowee and borrowers aware of each other.


* ks/tree-diff-nway (2014-03-20) 19 commits
 - combine-diff: speed it up, by using multiparent diff tree-walker directly
 - tree-diff: rework diff_tree() to generate diffs for multiparent cases as well
 - Portable alloca for Git
 - tree-diff: reuse base str(buf) memory on sub-tree recursion
 - tree-diff: no need to call "full" diff_tree_sha1 from show_path()
 - tree-diff: rework diff_tree interface to be sha1 based
 - tree-diff: diff_tree() should now be static
 - tree-diff: remove special-case diff-emitting code for empty-tree cases
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-25 at cfcbdac)
 + tree-diff: simplify tree_entry_pathcmp
 + tree-diff: show_path prototype is not needed anymore
 + tree-diff: rename compare_tree_entry -> tree_entry_pathcmp
 + tree-diff: move all action-taking code out of compare_tree_entry()
 + tree-diff: don't assume compare_tree_entry() returns -1,0,1
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-21 at d872679)
 + tree-diff: consolidate code for emitting diffs and recursion in one place
 + tree-diff: show_tree() is not needed
 + tree-diff: no need to pass match to skip_uninteresting()
 + tree-diff: no need to manually verify that there is no mode change for a path
 + combine-diff: move changed-paths scanning logic into its own function
 + combine-diff: move show_log_first logic/action out of paths scanning

 Instead of running N pair-wise diff-trees when inspecting a
 N-parent merge, find the set of paths that were touched by walking
 N+1 trees in parallel.  These set of paths can then be turned into
 N pair-wise diff-tree results to be processed through rename
 detections and such.  And N=2 case nicely degenerates to the usual
 2-way diff-tree, which is very nice.


* nd/log-show-linear-break (2014-03-20) 2 commits
 - log: add --show-linear-break to help see non-linear history
 - object.h: centralize object flag allocation

 Attempts to show where a single-strand-of-pearls break in "git log"
 output.

 The implementation seems to have got worse compared to the previous
 round.  Will hold.


* cc/interpret-trailers (2014-03-07) 11 commits
 - Documentation: add documentation for 'git interpret-trailers'
 - trailer: add tests for commands in config file
 - trailer: execute command from 'trailer.<name>.command'
 - trailer: add tests for "git interpret-trailers"
 - trailer: add interpret-trailers command
 - trailer: put all the processing together and print
 - trailer: parse trailers from stdin
 - trailer: process command line trailer arguments
 - trailer: read and process config information
 - trailer: process trailers from stdin and arguments
 - trailers: add data structures and basic functions

 A new filter to programatically edit the tail end of the commit log
 messages.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 . install_branch_config(): simplify verbose messages logic

 that the original with minimum refactoring would be easier to read.

 an/branch-config-message supersedes this topic.
