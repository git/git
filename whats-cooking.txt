What's cooking in git.git (Nov 2020, #01; Mon, 2)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'seen' (formerly 'pu'---proposed updates) while commits prefixed
with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

The third batch of topics in this cycle are in 'master' now,
including some microprojects by candidates for the Outreachy
program.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into.  Some repositories have
only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

Release tarballs are available at:

[Graduated to 'master']

* as/sample-push-to-checkout-hook (2020-10-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-10-26 at 644026c2f6)
 + hook: add sample template for push-to-checkout

 Add a sample 'push-to-checkout' hook, that performs the same as
 what the built-in default action does.


* bc/svn-hash-oid-fix (2020-10-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-10-26 at 743b549d5d)

 A recent oid->hash conversion missed one spot, breaking "git svn".


* bk/sob-dco (2020-10-20) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-10-26 at d0e5066a7e)
 + Documentation: stylistically normalize references to Signed-off-by:
 + SubmittingPatches: clarify DCO is our --signoff rule
 + Documentation: clarify and expand description of --signoff
 + doc: preparatory clean-up of description on the sign-off option

 Document that the meaning of a Signed-off-by trailer can vary from
 project to project in the end-user documentation, and clarify what
 it means to this project.

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2020-10-23

 Micro clean-up.


* ct/t0000-use-test-path-is-file (2020-10-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-10-26 at 9b70aa748f)
 + t0000: use test_path_is_file instead of "test -f"

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2020-10-23

 Micro clean-up of a test script.


* dl/diff-merge-base (2020-09-21) 10 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-10-26 at 114d94030b)
 + contrib/completion: complete `git diff --merge-base`
 + builtin/diff-tree: learn --merge-base
 + builtin/diff-index: learn --merge-base
 + t4068: add --merge-base tests
 + diff-lib: define diff_get_merge_base()
 + diff-lib: accept option flags in run_diff_index()
 + contrib/completion: extract common diff/difftool options
 + git-diff.txt: backtick quote command text
 + git-diff-index.txt: make --cached description a proper sentence
 + t4068: remove unnecessary >tmp

 "git diff A...B" learned "git diff --merge-base A B", which is a
 longer short-hand to say the same thing.


* dl/resurrect-update-for-sha256 (2020-10-08) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-10-26 at 7e94297aa4)
 + contrib/git-resurrect.sh: use hash-agnostic OID pattern
 + contrib/git-resurrect.sh: indent with tabs

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2020-10-23

 "git resurrect" script (in contrib/) learned that the object names
 may be longer than 40-hex depending on the hash function in use.


* ds/commit-graph-merging-fix (2020-10-09) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-10-26 at a0cf763826)
 + commit-graph: don't write commit-graph when disabled
 + commit-graph: ignore duplicates when merging layers

 When "git commit-graph" detects the same commit recorded more than
 once while it is merging the layers, it used to die.  The code now
 ignores all but one of them and continues.


* ds/maintenance-commit-graph-auto-fix (2020-10-12) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-10-26 at 429d1371d8)
 + maintenance: core.commitGraph=false prevents writes
 + maintenance: test commit-graph auto condition

 Test-coverage enhancement of running commit-graph task "git
 maintenance" as needed led to discovery and fix of a bug.


* en/sequencer-rollback-lock-cleanup (2020-10-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-10-26 at 1234e8297f)
 + sequencer: remove duplicate rollback_lock_file() call

 Code clean-up.


* en/t7518-unflake (2020-10-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-10-26 at 443459f7ca)
 + t7518: fix flaky grep invocation

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2020-10-23

 Work around flakiness in a test.


* en/test-selector (2020-10-18) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-10-26 at 3d6e77c3ff)
 + test-lib: reduce verbosity of skipped tests
 + t6006, t6012: adjust tests to use 'setup' instead of synonyms
 + test-lib: allow selecting tests by substring/glob with --run

 Our test scripts can be told to run only individual pieces while
 skipping others with the "--run=..." option; they were taught to
 take a substring of test title, in addition to numbers, to name the
 test pieces to run.


* es/test-cmp-typocatcher (2020-10-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-10-26 at 62d89db753)
 + Revert "test_cmp: diagnose incorrect arguments"

 A test helper "test_cmp A B" was taught to diagnose missing files A
 or B as a bug in test, but some tests legitimately wanted to notice
 a failure to even create file B as an error, in addition to leaving
 the expected result in it, and were misdiagnosed as a bug.  This
 has been corrected.


* es/tutorial-mention-asciidoc-early (2020-10-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-10-28 at 96e0d84d94)

 Doc update.


* jc/doc-final-resend (2020-10-26) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-10-30 at 2dd2c8a0d9)
 + SubmittingPatches: clarify the purpose of the final resend

 Update developer doc.


* jk/fast-import-marks-alloc-fix (2020-10-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-10-26 at 2f0a73fd48)
 + fast-import: fix over-allocation of marks storage

 "git fast-import" wasted a lot of memory when many marks were in use.


* jk/fast-import-marks-cleanup (2020-10-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-10-26 at 1ba987dd54)
 + fast-import: remove duplicated option-parsing line

 Code clean-up.


* jk/no-common (2020-10-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-10-26 at c888cb8b28)
 + config.mak.dev: build with -fno-common

 Dev support to catch a tentative definition of a variable in our C
 code as an error.


* jk/report-fn-typedef (2020-10-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-10-26 at fa4e128b65)
 + usage: define a type for a reporting function

 Code clean-up.


* js/avoid-split-sideband-message (2020-10-27) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-10-27 at 06b2f75522)
 + test-pkt-line: drop colon from sideband identity
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-10-26 at 1b550f3245)
 + sideband: report unhandled incomplete sideband messages as bugs
 + sideband: avoid reporting incomplete sideband messages
 (this branch is used by jk/sideband-more-error-checking.)

 The side-band status report can be sent at the same time as the
 primary payload multiplexed, but the demultiplexer on the receiving
 end incorrectly split a single status report into two, which has
 been corrected.


* js/ci-ghwf-dedup-tests (2020-10-12) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-10-26 at 4832a8f40b)
 + ci: make the "skip-if-redundant" check more defensive
 + ci: work around old records of GitHub runs

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2020-10-23

 GitHub Actions automated test improvement to skip tests on a tree
 identical to what has already been tested.


* js/default-branch-name-part-4-minus-1 (2020-10-23) 9 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-10-26 at 0a66b76c66)
 + t1400: prepare for `main` being default branch name
 + tests: prepare aligned mentions of the default branch name
 + t9902: prepare a test for the upcoming default branch name
 + t3200: prepare for `main` being shorter than `master`
 + t5703: adjust a test case for the upcoming default branch name
 + t6200: adjust suppression pattern to also match "main"
 + tests: start moving to a different default main branch name
 + t9801: use `--` in preparation for default branch rename
 + fmt-merge-msg: also suppress "into main" by default
 (this branch is used by js/default-branch-name-adjust-t5411.)

 Adjust tests so that they won't scream when the default initial
 branch name is changed to 'main'.


* js/t7006-cleanup (2020-10-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-10-26 at b8582f842d)
 + t7006: Use test_path_is_* functions in test script

 Code clean-up.


* jt/apply-reverse-twice (2020-10-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-10-26 at f060893eb7)
 + apply: when -R, also reverse list of sections

 "git apply -R" did not handle patches that touch the same path
 twice correctly, which has been corrected.  This is most relevant
 in a patch that changes a path from a regular file to a symbolic
 link (and vice versa).


* lo/zsh-completion (2020-10-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-10-26 at 100dc6adde)
 + completion: fix zsh installation instructions

 Update instructions for command line completion (in contrib/) for zsh.


* mk/diff-ignore-regex (2020-10-20) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-10-26 at c68727da93)
 + diff: add -I<regex> that ignores matching changes
 + merge-base, xdiff: zero out xpparam_t structures

 "git diff" family of commands learned the "-I<regex>" option to
 ignore hunks whose changed lines all match the given pattern.


* nk/dir-c-comment-update (2020-10-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-10-26 at 3a4cb82ad6)
 + dir.c: fix comments to agree with argument name

 Update stale in-code comment.


* sc/sequencer-gpg-octopus (2020-10-18) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-10-26 at e1c956e52a)
 + t3435: add tests for rebase -r GPG signing
 + sequencer: pass explicit --no-gpg-sign to merge
 + sequencer: fix gpg option passed to merge subcommand

 "git rebase --rebase-merges" did not correctly pass --gpg-sign
 command line option to underlying "git merge" when replaying a merge
 using non-default merge strategy or when replaying an octopus merge
 (because replaying a two-head merge with the default strategy was
 done in a separate codepath, the problem did not trigger for most
 users), which has been corrected.


* tk/credential-config (2020-10-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-10-26 at 6ab486f389)
 + credential: load default config

 "git credential' didn't honor the core.askPass configuration
 variable (among other things), which has been corrected.


* ve/userdiff-bash (2020-10-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-10-26 at 2b34be98fe)
 + userdiff: support Bash

 The userdiff pattern learned to identify the function definition in
 POSIX shells and bash.

 + sequencer: tolerate abbreviated stopped-sha file

 Recently the format of an internal state file "rebase -i" uses has
 been tightened up for consistency, which would hurt those who start
 "rebase -i" with old git and then continue with new git.  Loosen
 the reader side a bit (which we may want to tighten again in a year

 + ref-filter: handle CRLF at end-of-line more gracefully

 A commit and tag object may have CR at the end of each and
 every line (you can create such an object with hash-object or
 using --cleanup=verbatim to decline the default clean-up
 action), but it would make it impossible to have a blank line
 to separate the title from the body of the message.  Be lenient

* sj/untracked-files-in-submodule-directory-is-not-dirty (2020-10-26) 1 commit
 - diff: do not show submodule with untracked files as "-dirty"

 "git diff" showed a submodule working tree with untracked cruft as
 "Submodule commit <objectname>-dirty", but a natural expectation is
 that the "-dirty" indicator would align with "git describe --dirty",
 which does not consider having untracked files in the working tree
 as source of dirtiness.  The inconsistency has been fixed.

 Needs doc update.

* jk/symlinked-dotgitx-files (2020-10-23) 9 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-10-26 at c1dd37b024)
 + docs: document symlink restrictions for .git* files
 + fsck: complain when .gitattributes or .gitignore is a symlink
 + verify_path(): disallow symlinks in .gitattributes and .gitignore
 + t0060: test obscured .gitattributes and .gitignore matching
 + t7450: test .gitmodules symlink matching against obscured names
 + t7450: test verify_path() handling of gitmodules
 + t7415: rename to expand scope
 + fsck_tree(): wrap some long lines
 + fsck_tree(): fix shadowed variable

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2020-10-23

 "git fsck" and the corresponding check done during the transport
 learned to ensure that in-tree files like `.gitignore` and
 `.gitattributes` are not symbolic links.

 It seems that there are real projects with .gitignore recorded as
 symlinks, which may need to loosen the fsck setting.  Do we need
 to introduce a class that is separate from symlinked .gitmodules
 that probably is with potential consequences that is more grave?
