What's cooking in git.git (Oct 2015, #01; Mon, 5)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.

A set of releases for a handful of maintenance tracks have been
tagged (v2.6.1, v2.5.4, v2.4.10 and v2.3.10), thanks to Blake
Burkhart and Jeff King.

With somewhat reduced review bandwidth, I'd expect that the upcoming
cycle would be slower than usual.  At tinyurl.com/gitCal, I
tentatively drew a 14-week schedule for this cycle (I plan to be
offline during weeks #7-#9 myself---hopefully we'll have capable
interim maintainers to take care of the list traffic in the meantime
as in past years).

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* ad/bisect-terms (2015-08-03) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-09-01 at ede6e64)
 + bisect: allow setting any user-specified in 'git bisect start'
 + bisect: add 'git bisect terms' to view the current terms
 + bisect: add the terms old/new
 + bisect: sanity check on terms

 The use of 'good/bad' in "git bisect" made it confusing to use when
 hunting for a state change that is not a regression (e.g. bugfix).
 The command learned 'old/new' and then allows the end user to
 say e.g. "bisect start --term-old=fast --term=new=slow" to find a
 performance regression.

 Michael's idea to make 'good/bad' more intelligent does have
 certain attractiveness ($gname/272867), and may make some of
 the work on this topic a moot point, though.


* as/subtree-with-spaces (2015-09-08) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-09-09 at f3d763d)
 + contrib/subtree: respect spaces in a repository path
 + t7900-subtree: test the "space in a subdirectory name" case

 Update "git subtree" (in contrib/) so that it can take whitespaces
 in the pathnames, not only in the in-tree pathname but the name of
 the directory that the repository is in.


* bb/remote-get-url (2015-09-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-09-21 at c07a1e8)
 + remote: add get-url subcommand

 "git remote" learned "get-url" subcommand to show the URL for a
 given remote name used for fetching and pushing.


* dt/refs-bisection (2015-09-01) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-09-08 at 2b66bad)
 + refs: make refs/bisect/* per-worktree
 + path: optimize common dir checking
 + refs: clean up common_list
 (this branch is used by dt/refs-backend-lmdb.)

 Move the refs used during a "git bisect" session to per-worktree
 hierarchy refs/worktree/* so that independent bisect sessions can
 be done in different worktrees.

 The second commit may or may not want to be reverted.


* jc/rerere (2015-07-24) 21 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-08-26 at 8ae15ef)
 + rerere: un-nest merge() further
 + rerere: use "struct rerere_id" instead of "char *" for conflict ID
 + rerere: call conflict-ids IDs
 + rerere: further clarify do_rerere_one_path()
 + rerere: further de-dent do_plain_rerere()
 + rerere: refactor "replay" part of do_plain_rerere()
 + rerere: explain the remainder
 + rerere: explain "rerere forget" codepath
 + rerere: explain the primary codepath
 + rerere: explain MERGE_RR management helpers
 + rerere: fix benign off-by-one non-bug and clarify code
 + rerere: explain the rerere I/O abstraction
 + rerere: do not leak mmfile[] for a path with multiple stage #1 entries
 + rerere: stop looping unnecessarily
 + rerere: drop want_sp parameter from is_cmarker()
 + rerere: report autoupdated paths only after actually updating them
 + rerere: write out each record of MERGE_RR in one go
 + rerere: lift PATH_MAX limitation
 + rerere: plug conflict ID leaks
 + rerere: handle conflicts with multiple stage #1 entries
 + rerere: fix an off-by-one non-bug
 (this branch is used by jc/rerere-multi.)

 Code clean-up and minor fixes.


* jh/quiltimport-explicit-series-file (2015-09-01) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-09-02 at 1129ca4)
 + git-quiltimport: add commandline option --series <file>

 "quiltimport" allows to specify the series file by honoring the
 $QUILT_SERIES environment and also --series command line option.


* jk/async-pkt-line (2015-09-01) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-09-02 at e185717)
 + pkt-line: show packets in async processes as "sideband"
 + run-command: provide in_async query function

 The debugging infrastructure for pkt-line based communication has
 been improved to mark the side-band communication specifically.


* jk/blame-first-parent (2015-09-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-09-21 at 7580f6b)
 + blame: handle --first-parent

 "git blame --first-parent v1.0..v2.0" was not rejected but did not
 limit the blame to commits on the first parent chain.


* jk/connect-clear-env (2015-09-08) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-09-08 at 86b64f7)
 + git_connect: clarify conn->use_shell flag
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-09-06 at 9ddbed8)
 + git_connect: clear GIT_* environment for ssh

 The ssh transport, just like any other transport over the network,
 did not clear GIT_* environment variables, but it is possible to
 use SendEnv and AcceptEnv to leak them to the remote invocation of
 Git, which is not a good idea at all.  Explicitly clear them just
 like we do for the local transport.


* jk/date-local (2015-09-03) 11 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-09-08 at 66781d9)
 + t6300: add tests for "-local" date formats
 + t6300: make UTC and local dates different
 + date: make "local" orthogonal to date format
 + date: check for "local" before anything else
 + t6300: add test for "raw" date format
 + t6300: introduce test_date() helper
 + fast-import: switch crash-report date to iso8601
 + Documentation/rev-list: don't list date formats
 + Documentation/git-for-each-ref: don't list date formats
 + Documentation/config: don't list date formats
 + Documentation/blame-options: don't list date formats

 "git log --date=local" used to only show the normal (default)
 format in the local timezone.  The command learned to take 'local'
 as an instruction to use the local timezone with other formats,
 e.g. "git show --date=rfc-local".


* jk/interpret-trailers-outside-a-repository (2015-09-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-09-09 at a75fce3)
 + interpret-trailers: allow running outside a repository

 Allow "git interpret-trailers" to run outside of a Git repository.


* jk/make-findstring-makeflags-fix (2015-09-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-09-21 at 26ea6e0)
 + Makefile: fix MAKEFLAGS tests with multiple flags

 Customization to change the behaviour with "make -w" and "make -s"
 in our Makefile was broken when they were used together.


* jk/rebase-no-autostash (2015-09-10) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-09-21 at 034d726)
 + Documentation/git-rebase: fix --no-autostash formatting
 + rebase: support --no-autostash

 There was no way to defeat a configured rebase.autostash variable
 from the command line, as "git rebase --no-autostash" was missing.


* jk/test-lint-forbid-when-finished-in-subshell (2015-09-08) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-09-09 at 74ede61)
 + test-lib-functions: detect test_when_finished in subshell
 + t7800: don't use test_config in a subshell
 + test-lib-functions: support "test_config -C <dir> ..."
 + t5801: don't use test_when_finished in a subshell
 + t7610: don't use test_config in a subshell

 Because "test_when_finished" in our test framework queues the
 clean-up tasks to be done in a shell variable, it should not be
 used inside a subshell.  Add a mechanism to allow 'bash' to catch
 such uses, and fix the ones that were found.


* jw/make-arflags-customizable (2015-09-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-09-21 at cb3892c1)
 + Makefile: allow $(ARFLAGS) specified from the command line

 The Makefile always runs the library archiver with hardcoded "crs"
 options, which was inconvenient for exotic platforms on which
 people want to use programs with totally different set of command
 line options.


* kn/for-each-tag (2015-09-17) 17 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-09-17 at 1980952)
 + tag.c: implement '--merged' and '--no-merged' options
 + tag.c: implement '--format' option
 + tag.c: use 'ref-filter' APIs
 + tag.c: use 'ref-filter' data structures
 + ref-filter: add option to match literal pattern
 + ref-filter: add support to sort by version
 + ref-filter: add support for %(contents:lines=X)
 + ref-filter: add option to filter out tags, branches and remotes
 + ref-filter: implement an `align` atom
 + ref-filter: introduce match_atom_name()
 + ref-filter: introduce handler function for each atom
 + utf8: add function to align a string into given strbuf
 + ref-filter: introduce ref_formatting_state and ref_formatting_stack
 + ref-filter: move `struct atom_value` to ref-filter.c
 + strtoul_ui: reject negative values
 + Merge 'jk/git-path' into kn/for-each-tag
 + Merge 'kn/for-each-tag-branch' into kn/for-each-tag
 (this branch is used by dt/refs-backend-lmdb, kn/for-each-branch and kn/for-each-branch-remainder; uses kn/for-each-tag-branch.)

 The "ref-filter" code was taught about many parts of what "tag -l"
 does and then "tag -l" is being reimplemented in terms of "ref-filter".


* kn/for-each-tag-branch (2015-08-03) 11 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-08-03 at d9e94b9)
 + for-each-ref: add '--contains' option
 + ref-filter: implement '--contains' option
 + parse-options.h: add macros for '--contains' option
 + parse-option: rename parse_opt_with_commit()
 + for-each-ref: add '--merged' and '--no-merged' options
 + ref-filter: implement '--merged' and '--no-merged' options
 + ref-filter: add parse_opt_merge_filter()
 + for-each-ref: add '--points-at' option
 + ref-filter: implement '--points-at' option
 + tag: libify parse_opt_points_at()
 + t6302: for-each-ref tests for ref-filter APIs
 (this branch is used by dt/refs-backend-lmdb, kn/for-each-branch, kn/for-each-branch-remainder and kn/for-each-tag.)

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2015-07-15

 Some features from "git tag -l" and "git branch -l" have been made
 available to "git for-each-ref" so that eventually the unified
 implementation can be shared across all three, in a follow-up
 series or two.


* ld/p4-import-labels (2015-08-28) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-09-01 at cf9f1d6)
 + git-p4: fix P4 label import for unprocessed commits
 + git-p4: do not terminate creating tag for unknown commit
 + git-p4: failing test for ignoring invalid p4 labels

 Correct "git p4 --detect-labels" so that it does not fail to create
 a tag that points at a commit that is also being imported.


* mm/keyid-docs (2015-09-21) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-09-21 at f50ccab)
 + Documentation: explain optional arguments better
 + Documentation/grep: fix documentation of -O
 + Documentation: use 'keyid' consistently, not 'key-id'

 Very small number of options take a parameter that is optional
 (which is not a great UI element as they can only appear at the end
 of the command line).  Add notice to documentation of each and
 every one of them.


* nk/stash-show-config (2015-08-31) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-09-08 at 90dd06f)
 + stash: allow "stash show" diff output configurable

 Users who are too busy to type three extra keystrokes to ask for
 "git stash show -p" can now set stash.showPatch configuration
 varible to true to always see the actual patch, not just the list
 of paths affected with feel for the extent of damage via diffstat.


* sb/submodule-helper (2015-09-08) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-09-21 at 9354b31)
 + submodule: rewrite `module_clone` shell function in C
 + submodule: rewrite `module_name` shell function in C
 + submodule: rewrite `module_list` shell function in C
 + Merge 'hv/submodule-config' to 'sb/submodule-helper'
 (this branch is used by dt/refs-backend-lmdb and sb/submodule-parallel-fetch.)

 The infrastructure to rewrite "git submodule" in C is being built
 incrementally.  Let's polish these early parts well enough and make
 them graduate to 'next' and 'master', so that the more involved
 follow-up can start cooking on a solid ground.

* gr/rebase-i-drop-warn (2015-10-02) 2 commits
 - rebase-i: loosen over-eager check_bad_cmd check
 - rebase-i: explicitly accept tab as separator in commands

 "git rebase -i" had a minor regression recently, which stopped
 considering a line that begins with an indented '#' in its insn
 sheet not a comment, which is now fixed.

 - gc: remove stale .idx files without corresponding .pack file
 - prepare_packed_git(): refactor garbage reporting in pack directory

 Having a leftover .idx file without correspoinding .pack file in
 the repository hurts performance; "git gc" learned to prune them.

* mh/notes-allow-reading-treeish (2015-07-13) 1 commit
 - notes: allow treeish expressions as notes ref

 Some "git notes" operations, e.g. "git log --notes=<note>", should
 be able to read notes from any tree-ish that is shaped like a notes
 tree, but the notes infrastructure required that the argument must
 be a ref under refs/notes/.  Loosen it to require a valid ref only
 when the operation would update the notes (in which case we must
 have a place to store the updated notes tree, iow, a ref).

 Needs update to docs.

 . WIP: diff-b-m
 - diffcore-rename: allow easier debugging
 - diffcore-rename.c: add locate_rename_src()
 - diffcore-break: allow debugging

 "git diff -B -M" produced incorrect patch when the postimage of a
 completely rewritten file is similar to the preimage of a removed
 file; such a resulting file must not be expressed as a rename from
 other place.

 The fix in this patch is broken, unfortunately.

 - t5700: demonstrate a Windows file locking issue with `git clone --dissociate`

 "git clone --dissociate" runs a big "git repack" process at the
 end, and it helps to close file descriptors that are open on the
 packs and their idx files before doing so on filesystems that
 cannot remove a file that is still open.

* js/gc-with-stale-symref (2015-10-05) 2 commits
 - pack-objects: do not get distracted by broken symrefs
 - gc: demonstrate failure with stale remote HEAD

 "git gc" used to barf when a symbolic ref has gone dangling
 (e.g. the branch that used to be your upstream's default when you
 cloned from it is now gone, and you did "fetch --prune").

 - git-send-email.perl: Fixed sending of many/huge changes/patches

 When "git send-email" wanted to talk over Net::SMTP::SSL,
 Net::Cmd::datasend() did not like to be fed too many bytes at the
 same time and failed to send messages.  Send the payload one line
 at a time to work around the problem.

* nd/gc-auto-background-fix (2015-09-21) 1 commit
 - gc: save log from daemonized gc --auto and print it next time

 --auto" is run.

* jk/graph-format-padding (2015-09-14) 1 commit
 - pretty: pass graph width to pretty formatting for use in '%>|(N)'

 Redefine the way '%>|(N)' padding and the "--graph" option
 interacts.  It has been that the available columns to display the
 log message was measured from the edge of the area the graph ended,
 but with this it becomes the beginning of the entire output.

 I have a suspicion that 50% of the users would appreciate this
 change, and the remainder see this break their expectation.  If
 that is the case, we might need to introduce a similar but
 different alignment operator so that this new behaviour is
 available to those who want to use it, without negatively affecting
 existing uses.

 Undecided.

 + dir.c: don't exclude whole dir prematurely if neg pattern may match
 + dir.c: make last_exclude_matching_from_list() run til the end

 Allow a later "!/abc/def" to override an earlier "/abc" that

 - sigchain: add command to pop all common signals
 - strbuf: add strbuf_read_once to read without blocking
 - xread_nonblock: add functionality to read from fds without blocking
 - xread: poll on non blocking fds
 - submodule.c: write "Fetching submodule <foo>" to stderr

 Add a framework to spawn a group of processes in parallel, and use
 it to run "git fetch --recurse-submodules" in parallel.

 The overall structure seems more-or-less sensible.

  (merged to 'next' on 2015-09-08 at c8047ba)
 + pager: don't use unsafe functions in signal handlers

 Allocation related functions and stdio are unsafe things to call
 inside a signal handler, and indeed killing the pager can cause
 glibc to deadlock waiting on allocation mutex as our signal handler
 tries to free() some data structures in wait_for_pager().  Reduce
 these unsafe calls.

 - rerere: handle leftover rr-cache/$ID directory and postimage files
 - rerere: scan $GIT_DIR/rr-cache/$ID when instantiating a rerere_id
 - rerere: split conflict ID further

 "git rerere" can encounter two or more files with the same conflict

 no way to record these separate resolutions.

 "git log" (but not other commands in the "log" family) learned to
 pay attention to the log.merges configuration variable that can be
 set to "show" (the normal behaviour), "only" (hide non-merge
 commits), or "hide" (hide merge commits).  --merges=(show|only|hide)
 can be used to override the setting from the command line.

 Warn when a reencoding is requested in a build without iconv
