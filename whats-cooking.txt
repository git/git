What's cooking in git.git (Jun 2013, #03; Thu, 6)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* jk/list-objects-sans-blobs (2013-06-06) 4 commits
 - archive: ignore blob objects when checking reachability
 - list-objects: optimize "revs->blob_objects = 0" case
 - upload-archive: restrict remote objects with reachability check
 - clear parsed flag when we free tree buffers

 Attempt to allow "archive --remote=$there $arbitrary_sha1" while
 keeping the reachability safety.

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* dm/unbash-subtree (2013-05-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-06-03 at 2c9d2fb)
 + contrib/git-subtree: Use /bin/sh interpreter instead of /bin/bash

 It turns out that git-subtree script does not have to be run with
 bash.


* fc/cleanups (2013-05-28) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-06-03 at 527cf93)
 + test: rebase: fix --interactive test
 + test: trivial cleanups
 + remote: trivial style cleanup


* fc/makefile (2013-05-26) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-06-03 at d1074e4)
 + build: do not install git-remote-testpy
 + build: add NO_INSTALL variable
 + build: cleanup using $<
 + build: cleanup using $^
 + build: trivial simplification
 (this branch is used by fc/remote-helpers-use-specified-python.)

 Stop installing the git-remote-testpy script that is only used for
 testing.  Also use handy magic variables to simplify rules.


* fc/send-email-chainreplyto-warning (2013-05-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-06-03 at e04764f)
 + send-email: remove warning about unset chainreplyto

 An overdue removal of "behaviour changed at 1.7.0; if you were
 living in a cave, here is what you can adjust to it" message.


* fc/show-branch-in-rebase-am (2013-05-29) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-06-03 at 176f6b7)
 + prompt: fix for simple rebase

 The bash prompt code (in contrib/) displayed the name of the branch
 being rebased when "rebase -i/-m/-p" modes are in use, but not the
 plain vanilla "rebase".


* fc/transport-helper-no-refspec (2013-05-21) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-06-03 at 8763bda)
 + transport-helper: check if the dry-run is supported
 + transport-helper: barf when user tries old:new

 With "export" remote-helper protocol, (1) a push that tries to
 update a remote ref whose name is different from the pushing side
 does not work yet, and (2) the helper may not know how to do
 --dry-run, so detect such problematic cases and disable them for
 now.


* jc/core-checkstat (2013-05-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-06-03 at 2166cb3)
 + deprecate core.statinfo at Git 2.0 boundary
 (this branch is used by jc/core-checkstat-2.0.)

 The configuration variable core.checkstat was advertised in the
 documentation but the code expected core.statinfo instead.

 For now, we accept both core.checkstat and core.statinfo, but the
 latter will be removed in the longer term.


* ks/difftool-dir-diff-copy-fix (2013-05-29) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-06-03 at ca0cae0)
 + difftool --dir-diff: allow changing any clean working tree file

 "difftool --dir-diff" did not copy back changes made by the
 end-user in the diff tool backend to the working tree in some
 cases.


* nd/clone-connectivity-shortcut (2013-05-28) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-06-03 at 812bd80)
 + clone: open a shortcut for connectivity check
 + index-pack: remove dead code (it should never happen)
 + fetch-pack: prepare updated shallow file before fetching the pack
 + clone: let the user know when check_everything_connected is run

 "git clone" uses a lighter-weight implementation when making sure
 that the history behind refs are complete.


* nd/prune-packed-dryrun-verbose (2013-05-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-06-03 at 3445b27)
 + prune-packed: avoid implying "1" is DRY_RUN in prune_packed_objects()


* nd/urls-doc-no-file-hyperlink-fix (2013-05-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-06-03 at 54903b2)
 + urls.txt: avoid auto converting to hyperlink

 An entry for "file://" scheme in the enumeration of URL types Git
 can take in the HTML documentation was made into a clickable link
 by mistake.


* rj/mingw-compat-st-mode-bits (2013-05-29) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-06-03 at 2efe84c)
 + path: Fix a sparse warning


* rr/push-head (2013-05-29) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-06-03 at ecd5be7)
 + push: make push.default = current use resolved HEAD
 + push: fail early with detached HEAD and current
 + push: factor out the detached HEAD error message

 "git push $there HEAD:branch" did not resolve HEAD early enough, so
 it was easy to flip it around while push is still going on and push
 out a branch that the user did not originally intended when the
 command was started.


* rr/zsh-color-prompt (2013-05-17) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-06-03 at d011a76)
 + prompt: colorize ZSH prompt
 + prompt: factor out gitstring coloring logic
 + prompt: introduce GIT_PS1_STATESEPARATOR


* rs/commit-m-no-edit (2013-05-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-06-03 at 14329fa)
 + commit: don't start editor if empty message is given with -m

 "git commit --allow-empty-message -m ''" should not start an
 editor.


* sb/archive-zip-double-assignment-fix (2013-05-29) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-06-03 at c316eec)
 + archive-zip:write_zip_entry: Remove second reset of size variable to zero.


* tg/maint-zsh-svn-remote-prompt (2013-05-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-06-03 at 32a45c0)
 + prompt: fix show upstream with svn and zsh

 zsh prompt script that borrowed from bash prompt script did not
 work due to slight differences in array variable notation between
 these two shells.


* th/bisect-skip-report-range-fix (2013-05-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-06-03 at 7bd4656)
 + bisect: Fix log output for multi-parent skip ranges

 Fix for an additional bisect log comments.


* tr/push-no-verify-doc (2013-05-23) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-06-03 at 01737d6)
 + Document push --no-verify

 "git push --[no-]verify" was not documented.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* fc/remote-helpers-use-specified-python (2013-05-28) 4 commits
 - remote-helpers: add exec-path links
 - remote-helpers: allow direct test execution
 - remote-helpers: rename tests
 - remote-helpers: generate scripts

 I do not particularly think the second from the bottom is a good
 change, but it takes the remainder of the series hostage.

 Waiting for a reroll.


* jk/packed-refs-race (2013-05-06) 4 commits
 - for_each_ref: load all loose refs before packed refs
 - get_packed_refs: reload packed-refs file when it changes
 - add a stat_validity struct
 - resolve_ref: close race condition for packed refs

 Will be rerolled.


* mg/more-textconv (2013-05-10) 7 commits
 - grep: honor --textconv for the case rev:path
 - grep: allow to use textconv filters
 - t7008: demonstrate behavior of grep with textconv
 - cat-file: do not die on --textconv without textconv filters
 - show: honor --textconv for blobs
 - diff_opt: track whether flags have been set explicitly
 - t4030: demonstrate behavior of show with textconv

 Make "git grep" and "git show" pay attention to --textconv when
 dealing with blob objects.

 I thought this was pretty well designed and executed, but it seems
 there are some doubts on the list; kicking back to 'pu'.


* mh/multimail (2013-04-21) 1 commit
 - git-multimail: a replacement for post-receive-email

 Waiting for the initial history to pull from.
 $gmane/223564


* jc/format-patch (2013-04-22) 2 commits
 - format-patch: --inline-single
 - format-patch: rename "no_inline" field

 A new option to send a single patch to the standard output to be
 appended at the bottom of a message.  I personally have no need for
 this, but it was easy enough to cobble together.  Tests, docs and
 stripping out more MIMEy stuff are left as exercises to interested
 parties.

 Not ready for inclusion.

 Will discard unless we hear from anybody who is interested in
 tying its loose ends.


* jk/gitweb-utf8 (2013-04-08) 4 commits
 - gitweb: Fix broken blob action parameters on blob/commitdiff pages
 - gitweb: Don't append ';js=(0|1)' to external links
 - gitweb: Make feed title valid utf8
 - gitweb: Fix utf8 encoding for blob_plain, blobdiff_plain, commitdiff_plain, and patch

 Various fixes to gitweb.

 Drew Northup volunteered to take a look into this.
 $gmane/226216


* jk/commit-info-slab (2013-04-19) 3 commits
 - commit-slab: introduce a macro to define a slab for new type
 - commit-slab: avoid large realloc
 - commit: allow associating auxiliary info on-demand
 (this branch is used by jc/show-branch.)

 Technology demonstration to show a way we could use unbound number
 of flag bits on commit objects.


* jc/show-branch (2013-05-21) 5 commits
 - show-branch: use commit slab to represent bitflags of arbitrary width
 - show-branch.c: remove "all_mask"
 - show-branch.c: abstract out "flags" operation
 - show-branch.c: lift all_mask/all_revs to a global static
 - show-branch.c: update comment style
 (this branch uses jk/commit-info-slab.)

 Waiting for the final step to lift the hard-limit before sending it out.

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* ar/wildmatch-foldcase (2013-06-02) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-06-04 at 3180bcc)
 + wildmatch: properly fold case everywhere

 The wildmatch engine did not honor WM_CASEFOLD option correctly.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* cr/git-work-tree-sans-git-dir (2013-06-03) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-06-04 at bebedca)
 + git.txt: remove stale comment regarding GIT_WORK_TREE

 These days, "git --work-tree=there cmd" without specifying an
 explicit --git-dir=here will do the usual discovery, but we had a
 description of older behaviour in the documentation.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* fc/do-not-use-the-index-in-add-to-index (2013-06-03) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-06-04 at 94e7b60)
 + read-cache: trivial style cleanups
 + read-cache: fix wrong 'the_index' usage

 Will merge to 'master'.


* fc/sequencer-skip-quiet (2013-06-06) 5 commits
 - sequencer: run post-rewrite hook
 - cherry-pick: store rewritten commits
 - cherry-pick: add --skip-empty option
 - sequencer: avoid leaking message buffer when refusing to create an empty commit
 - sequencer: remove useless indentation

 The bottom three looked more or less reasonable.  Execution of
 post-rewrite hook could use a better refactoring from the original
 code copied from builtin/commit.c, though.


* js/test-ln-s-add (2013-06-02) 11 commits
 - t6035: use test_ln_s_add to remove SYMLINKS prerequisite
 - t3509, t4023, t4114: use test_ln_s_add to remove SYMLINKS prerequisite
 - t3100: use test_ln_s_add to remove SYMLINKS prerequisite
 - t3030: use test_ln_s_add to remove SYMLINKS prerequisite
 - t2100: use test_ln_s_add to remove SYMLINKS prerequisite
 - t0000: use test_ln_s_add to remove SYMLINKS prerequisite
 - tests: use test_ln_s_add to remove SYMLINKS prerequisite (trivial cases)
 - tests: introduce test_ln_s and test_ln_s_add
 - t3010: modernize style
 - t2100: modernize style and unroll a loop of test cases
 - test-chmtime: Fix exit code on Windows

 Many tests that check the behaviour of symbolic links stored in the
 index or the tree objects do not have to be skipped on a filesystem
 that lack symbolic link support.

 There seem to be some misconversion, mostly around the use of the
 new test_ln_s helper.

 Will be rerolled.
 $gmane/226466,226467


* mt/send-email-cc-match-fix (2013-06-05) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-06-06 at e4d0831)
 + test-send-email: test for pre-sanitized self name
 + t/send-email: test suppress-cc=self with non-ascii
 + t/send-email: add test with quoted sender
 + send-email: make --suppress-cc=self sanitize input
 + t/send-email: test suppress-cc=self on cccmd
 + send-email: fix suppress-cc=self on cccmd
 + t/send-email.sh: add test for suppress-cc=self

 Logic git-send-email used to suppress cc mishandled names like "A
 U. Thor" <author@example.xz>, where the human readable part needs
 to be quoted (the user input may not have the double quotes around
 the name, and comparison was done between quoted and unquoted
 strings).

 Will merge to 'master'.


* rr/complete-difftool (2013-06-03) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-06-04 at 01c7611)
 + completion: clarify ls-tree, archive, show completion
 + completion: difftool takes both revs and files

 Update command line completion (in contrib/) to use a better named
 completion helper function for commands that take revisions and
 paths.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* rr/diffcore-pickaxe-doc (2013-06-03) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-06-04 at 67d1fc7)
 + diffcore-pickaxe doc: document -S and -G properly
 + diffcore-pickaxe: make error messages more consistent

 Update the low-level diffcore documentation on -S/-G and --pickaxe-all.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* tr/sha1-file-silence-loose-object-info-under-prune-race (2013-06-03) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-06-04 at e891bb8)
 + sha1_file: silence sha1_loose_object_info

 Will merge to 'master'.


* bp/mediawiki-credential (2013-06-05) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-06-05 at ea07ec1)
 + git-remote-mediawiki: use Git.pm functions for credentials

 The bridge to MediaWiki has been updated to use the credential
 helper interface in Git.pm, losing its own and the original
 implementation the former was based on.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* mz/rebase-tests (2013-06-03) 7 commits
 - tests: move test for rebase messages from t3400 to t3406
 - t3406: modernize style
 - add tests for rebasing merged history
 - add tests for rebasing root
 - add tests for rebasing of empty commits
 - add tests for rebasing with patch-equivalence present
 - add simple tests of consistency across rebase types

 Will be rerolled.


* fc/completion-less-ls-remote (2013-06-02) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-06-03 at 6624f0b)
 + completion: avoid ls-remote in certain scenarios

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/test-exit-code-by-signal (2013-06-06) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-06-06 at 6fdea1b)
 + t0005: skip signal death exit code test on Windows
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-06-03 at 25af892)
 + t0005: test git exit code from signal death

 Will merge to 'master'.


* nd/make-wildmatch-default (2013-06-02) 1 commit
 - Makefile: promote wildmatch to be the default fnmatch implementation

 Will merge to 'next'.


* rr/remove-contrib-some (2013-06-02) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-06-05 at fc15705)
 + contrib: remove continuous/ and patches/

 Remove stale contrib/ material.


* rs/unpack-trees-plug-leak (2013-06-02) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-06-03 at 97e7b6d)
 + unpack-trees: free cache_entry array members for merges
 + diff-lib, read-tree, unpack-trees: mark cache_entry array paramters const
 + diff-lib, read-tree, unpack-trees: mark cache_entry pointers const
 + unpack-trees: create working copy of merge entry in merged_entry
 + unpack-trees: factor out dup_entry
 + read-cache: mark cache_entry pointers const
 + cache: mark cache_entry pointers const

 Will merge to 'master'.


* tr/test-commit-only-on-orphan (2013-06-02) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-06-03 at b1864fd)
 + Test 'commit --only' after 'checkout --orphan'

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ap/diff-ignore-blank-lines (2013-05-29) 1 commit
 - diff: add --ignore-blank-lines option

 "git diff" learned a mode that ignores hunks whose change consists
 only of additions and removals of blank lines, which is the same as
 "diff -B" (ignore blank lines) of GNU diff.

 Will be rerolled.
 $gmane/226394


* rj/mingw-cygwin (2013-05-08) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-06-04 at 308fdb4)
 + cygwin: Remove the CYGWIN_V15_WIN32API build variable
 + mingw: rename WIN32 cpp macro to GIT_WINDOWS_NATIVE

 Update build for Cygwin 1.[57].  Torsten Bögershausen reports that
 this is fine with Cygwin 1.7 ($gmane/225824) so let's try moving it
 ahead.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* rr/rebase-autostash (2013-05-29) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-06-04 at 16f7c54)

 Will merge to 'master'.


* xq/credential-osxkeychain (2013-05-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-06-04 at a4ee0e0)
 + credential-osxkeychain: support more protocols

 Will merge to 'master'.


* mh/reflife (2013-06-02) 25 commits

 + builtin_diff_tree(): make it obvious that function wants two entries
 + add_rev_cmdline(): make a copy of the name argument
 + fetch: make own copies of refnames
 + describe: make own copy of refname

 Define memory ownership and lifetime rules for what for-each-ref
 feeds to its callbacks (in short, "you do not own it, so make a
 copy if you want to keep it").

 Will merge to 'master'.


* mm/mediawiki-https-fail-message (2013-05-29) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-06-04 at fb2671c)
 + git-remote-mediawiki: better error message when HTTP(S) access fails

 Hint users when https:// connection failed to check the
 certificate; it is a good hint if we assumie that it is common
 error for the end users to make.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* rr/die-on-missing-upstream (2013-06-02) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-06-03 at 00847ea)
 + sha1_name: fix error message for @{<N>}, @{<date>}
 + sha1_name: fix error message for @{u}

 When a reflog notation is used for implicit "current branch", we
 did not say which branch and worse said "branch ''".

 Will merge to 'master'.


* fc/remote-bzr (2013-05-28) 8 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-06-04 at a603082)

* tr/test-v-and-v-subtest-only (2013-05-16) 6 commits
 - test-lib: support running tests under valgrind in parallel
 - test-lib: allow prefixing a custom string before "ok N" etc.
 - test-lib: valgrind for only tests matching a pattern
 - test-lib: verbose mode for only tests matching a pattern
 - test-lib: refactor $GIT_SKIP_TESTS matching
 - test-lib: enable MALLOC_* for the actual tests

 Allows N instances of tests run in parallel, each running 1/N parts
 of the test suite under Valgrind, to speed things up.

 The tip one may be useful in practice but is a tad ugly ;-)

 There seem to be some miscounting by toggling the verbose/valgrind
 mode at wrong places?  Cf. $gmane/225735

 Waiting for a reroll.


* fc/contrib-related (2013-06-03) 4 commits
 - contrib: related: parse committish like format-patch
 - contrib: related: add option to parse from committish

  (merged to 'next' on 2013-06-05 at 193242b)
 + revision.c: make default history consider bottom commits
 + revision.c: don't show all merges for --parents
 + revision.c: discount side branches when computing TREESAME
 + revision.c: add BOTTOM flag for commits
 + simplify-merges: drop merge from irrelevant side branch

 + t6111: allow checking the parents as well
 + t6111: new TREESAME test set
 + t6019: test file dropped in -s ours merge
 + decorate.c: compact table when growing

 Major update to a very core part of the revision traversal logic to
 improve culling of irrelevant parents while traversing a mergy
 history.


* mm/color-auto-default (2013-05-15) 2 commits
 - make color.ui default to 'auto'
 - config: refactor management of color.ui's default value

 Flip the default for color.ui to 'auto', which is what many
 tutorials recommend new users to do.  The updated code claims the
 switch happened at Git 2.0 in the past tense, but we might want to
 expedite it, as this change is not all that important to deserve a
 major version bump.

 I'd vote for merging this without waiting for 2.0.  Comments?

 Waiting for a reroll.


* jh/shorten-refname (2013-05-07) 4 commits
 - t1514: refname shortening is done after dereferencing symbolic refs
 - shorten_unambiguous_ref(): Fix shortening refs/remotes/origin/HEAD to origin
 - t1514: Demonstrate failure to correctly shorten "refs/remotes/origin/HEAD"
 - t1514: Add tests of shortening refnames in strict/loose mode

 When remotes/origin/HEAD is not a symbolic ref, "rev-parse
 --abbrev-ref remotes/origin/HEAD" ought to show "origin", not
 "origin/HEAD", which is fixed with this series (if it is a symbolic
 ref that points at remotes/origin/something, then it should show
 "origin/something" and it already does).

 Expecting a reroll, as an early part of a larger series.


* nd/warn-ambiguous-object-name (2013-05-29) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-06-04 at e87c9d1)
 + get_sha1: warn about full or short object names that look like refs

 "git cmd <name>", when <name> happens to be a 40-hex string,
 directly uses the 40-hex string as an object name, even if a ref
 "refs/<some hierarchy>/<name>" exists.  This disambiguation order
 is unlikely to change, but we should warn about the ambiguity just
 like we warn when more than one refs/ hierachies share the same
 name.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* fc/at-head (2013-05-08) 13 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-06-04 at f334a2a)
 + sha1_name: compare variable with constant, not constant with variable
 + Add new @ shortcut for HEAD
 + sha1_name: refactor reinterpret()
 + sha1_name: check @{-N} errors sooner
 + sha1_name: reorganize get_sha1_basic()
 + sha1_name: don't waste cycles in the @-parsing loop
 + sha1_name: remove unnecessary braces
 + sha1_name: remove no-op
 + tests: at-combinations: @{N} versus HEAD@{N}
 + tests: at-combinations: increase coverage
 + tests: at-combinations: improve nonsense()
 + tests: at-combinations: check ref names directly
 + tests: at-combinations: simplify setup

 Instead of typing four capital letters "HEAD", you can say "@"
 instead.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/submodule-subdirectory-ok (2013-04-24) 3 commits
 - submodule: fix quoting in relative_path()
 - submodule: drop the top-level requirement
 - rev-parse: add --prefix option

 Allow various subcommands of "git submodule" to be run not from the
 top of the working tree of the superproject.

 Waiting for a reroll.


* jl/submodule-mv (2013-04-23) 5 commits
 - submodule.c: duplicate real_path's return value
 - rm: delete .gitmodules entry of submodules removed from the work tree
 - Teach mv to update the path entry in .gitmodules for moved submodules
 - Teach mv to move submodules using a gitfile
 - Teach mv to move submodules together with their work trees

 "git mv A B" when moving a submodule A does "the right thing",
 inclusing relocating its working tree and adjusting the paths in
 the .gitmodules file.

 Waiting for a reroll.
