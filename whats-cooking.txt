What's cooking in git.git (Feb 2020, #04; Mon, 17)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

Accumulated fixes on the 'master' front have been flushed to 'maint'
and a new maintenance release 2.25.1 has been tagged.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* ag/edit-todo-drop-check (2020-01-28) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-07 at 687c82cd3a)
 + rebase-interactive: warn if commit is dropped with `rebase --edit-todo'
 + sequencer: move check_todo_list_from_file() to rebase-interactive.c
 (this branch uses js/rebase-i-with-colliding-hash.)

 Allow the rebase.missingCommitsCheck configuration to kick in when
 "rebase --edit-todo" and "rebase --continue" restarts the procedure.


* ag/rebase-avoid-unneeded-checkout (2020-01-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-07 at b08da07534)
 + rebase -i: stop checking out the tip of the branch to rebase

 "git rebase -i" (and friends) used to unnecessarily check out the
 tip of the branch to be rebased, which has been corrected.


* bc/hash-independent-tests-part-8 (2020-02-07) 21 commits

 + t2018: improve style of if-statement
 + t2018: add space between function name and ()
 + t2018: remove trailing space from test description

 Test updates.


* ds/sparse-checkout-harden (2020-01-31) 15 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-07 at 56c09b944f)
 + sparse-checkout: fix cone mode behavior mismatch
 + sparse-checkout: improve docs around 'set' in cone mode
 + sparse-checkout: escape all glob characters on write

 + clone: fix --sparse option with URLs
 + sparse-checkout: create leading directories
 + t1091: improve here-docs
 + t1091: use check_files to reduce boilerplate
 (this branch is used by ds/sparse-add.)

 Some rough edges in the sparse-checkout feature, especially around
 the cone mode, have been cleaned up.


* es/outside-repo-errmsg-hints (2020-02-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-16 at ed78b064b4)
 + prefix_path: show gitdir when arg is outside repo

 Error message clarification.


* hw/advice-add-nothing (2020-02-06) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-07 at 3c2a5c1868)
 + add: change advice config variables used by the add API
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-01-22 at 3fe4494fa6)
 + add: use advise function to display hints

 Two help messages given when "git add" notices the user gave it
 nothing to add have been updated to use advise() API.


* jh/notes-fanout-fix (2020-02-04) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-07 at a4ec94aee0)
 + notes.c: fix off-by-one error when decreasing notes fanout
 + t3305: check notes fanout more carefully and robustly

 The code to automatically shrink the fan-out in the notes tree had
 an off-by-one bug, which has been killed.


* jk/alloc-cleanups (2020-02-04) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-07 at f259621312)
 + tree-walk.c: break circular dependency with unpack-trees
 + traverse_trees(): use stack array for name entries
 + walker_fetch(): avoid raw array length computation
 + normalize_path_copy(): document "dst" size expectations

 Misc code clean-ups.


* jk/diff-honor-wserrhighlight-in-plumbing (2020-01-31) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-07 at acb077fdcb)
 + diff: move diff.wsErrorHighlight to "basic" config

 The diff-* plumbing family of subcommands now pay attention to the
 diff.wsErrorHighlight configuration, which has been ignored before;
 this allows "git add -p" to also show the whitespace problems to
 the end user.


* jk/doc-credential-helper (2020-02-14) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-16 at 0909d3f981)
 + doc: move credential helper info into gitcredentials(7)

 Docfix.


* jk/get-oid-error-message-i18n (2020-01-30) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-07 at 6bfe9235e5)
 + sha1-name: mark get_oid() error messages for translation
 + t1506: drop space after redirection operator
 + t1400: avoid "test" string comparisons

 A low-level API function get_oid(), that accepts various ways to
 name an object, used to issue end-user facing error messages
 without l10n, which has been updated to be translatable.


* jk/index-pack-dupfix (2020-02-04) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-07 at e6d79d432b)
 + index-pack: downgrade twice-resolved REF_DELTA to die()

 The index-pack code now diagnoses a bad input packstream that
 records the same object twice when it is used as delta base; the
 code used to declare a software bug when encountering such an
 input, but it is an input error.


* jk/mailinfo-cleanup (2020-02-11) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-11 at ab9890fbcb)
 + mailinfo: factor out some repeated header handling
 + mailinfo: be more liberal with header whitespace
 + mailinfo: simplify parsing of header values
 + mailinfo: treat header values as C strings
 (this branch uses rs/strbuf-insertstr.)

 Code clean-up.


* jk/packfile-reuse-cleanup (2020-01-23) 12 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-07 at c543bc27fb)
 + pack-bitmap: don't rely on bitmap_git->reuse_objects
 + pack-objects: add checks for duplicate objects
 + pack-objects: improve partial packfile reuse
 + builtin/pack-objects: introduce obj_is_packed()
 + pack-objects: introduce pack.allowPackReuse
 + csum-file: introduce hashfile_total()
 + pack-bitmap: simplify bitmap_has_oid_in_uninteresting()
 + pack-bitmap: uninteresting oid can be outside bitmapped packfile
 + pack-bitmap: introduce bitmap_walk_contains()
 + ewah/bitmap: introduce bitmap_word_alloc()
 + packfile: expose get_delta_base()
 + builtin/pack-objects: report reused packfile objects

 The way "git pack-objects" reuses objects stored in existing pack
 to generate its result has been improved.


* jn/promote-proto2-to-default (2020-01-15) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-07 at 5597fd726b)
 + fetch: default to protocol version 2
 + protocol test: let protocol.version override GIT_TEST_PROTOCOL_VERSION
 + test: request GIT_TEST_PROTOCOL_VERSION=0 when appropriate
 + config doc: protocol.version is not experimental
 + fetch test: use more robust test for filtered objects

 The transport protocol version 2 becomes the default one.


* js/mingw-open-in-gdb (2020-02-14) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-16 at 6670f36d73)
 + mingw: add a helper function to attach GDB to the current process

 Dev support.


* js/rebase-i-with-colliding-hash (2020-01-23) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-07 at 670ba07c4d)
 + rebase -i: also avoid SHA-1 collisions with missingCommitsCheck
 + rebase -i: re-fix short SHA-1 collision
 + parse_insn_line(): improve error message when parsing failed
 (this branch is used by ag/edit-todo-drop-check.)

 "git rebase -i" identifies existing commits in its todo file with
 their abbreviated object name, which could become ambigous as it
 goes to create new commits, and has a mechanism to avoid ambiguity
 in the main part of its execution.  A few other cases however were
 not covered by the protection against ambiguity, which has been
 corrected.


* js/test-avoid-pipe (2020-02-14) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-16 at 090cac9c23)
 + t9001, t9116: avoid pipes

 Test clean-up.


* js/test-unc-fetch (2020-02-14) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-16 at a4ca01efef)
 + t5580: test cloning without file://, test fetching via UNC paths

 Test updates.


* js/test-write-junit-xml-fix (2020-02-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-16 at 2deb247550)
 + tests: fix --write-junit-xml with subshells

 Testfix.


* jt/connectivity-check-optim-in-partial-clone (2020-01-30) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-07 at ca5102fa58)
 + fetch: forgo full connectivity check if --filter
 + connected: verify promisor-ness of partial clone

 Unneeded connectivity check is now disabled in a partial clone when
 fetching into it.


* kw/fsmonitor-watchman-racefix (2020-01-23) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-07 at 3c42195a34)
 + fsmonitor: update documentation for hook version and watchman hooks
 + fsmonitor: add fsmonitor hook scripts for version 2
 + fsmonitor: handle version 2 of the hooks that will use opaque token
 + fsmonitor: change last update timestamp on the index_state to opaque token

 A new version of fsmonitor-watchman hook has been introduced, to
 avoid races.


* ld/p4-cleanup-processes (2020-01-30) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-07 at e8c573f01c)
 + git-p4: avoid leak of file handle when cloning
 + git-p4: check for access to remote host earlier
 + git-p4: cleanup better on error exit
 + git-p4: create helper function importRevisions()
 + git-p4: disable some pylint warnings, to get pylint output to something manageable
 + git-p4: add P4CommandException to report errors talking to Perforce
 + git-p4: make closeStreams() idempotent

 p4 updates.


* mr/show-config-scope (2020-02-10) 10 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-11 at 904bca086e)
 + config: add '--show-scope' to print the scope of a config value
 + submodule-config: add subomdule config scope
 + config: teach git_config_source to remember its scope
 + config: preserve scope in do_git_config_sequence
 + config: clarify meaning of command line scoping
 + config: split repo scope to local and worktree
 + config: make scope_name non-static and rename it
 + t1300: create custom config file without special characters
 + t1300: fix over-indented HERE-DOCs
 + config: fix typo in variable name
 (this branch is used by bw/remote-rename-update-config and es/bugreport.)

 "git config" learned to show in which "scope", in addition to in
 which file, each config setting comes from.


* mt/threaded-grep-in-object-store (2020-01-17) 12 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-07 at e86bab09e1)
 + grep: use no. of cores as the default no. of threads
 + grep: move driver pre-load out of critical section
 + grep: re-enable threads in non-worktree case
 + grep: protect packed_git [re-]initialization
 + grep: allow submodule functions to run in parallel
 + submodule-config: add skip_if_read option to repo_read_gitmodules()
 + grep: replace grep_read_mutex by internal obj read lock
 + object-store: allow threaded access to object reading
 + replace-object: make replace operations thread-safe
 + grep: fix racy calls in grep_objects()
 + grep: fix race conditions at grep_submodule()
 + grep: fix race conditions on userdiff calls

 Traditionally, we avoided threaded grep while searching in objects
 (as opposed to files in the working tree) as accesses to the object
 layer is not thread-safe.  This limitation is getting lifted.


* mt/use-passed-repo-more-in-funcs (2020-01-31) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-07 at 536709ab4b)
 + sha1-file: allow check_object_signature() to handle any repo
 + sha1-file: pass git_hash_algo to hash_object_file()
 + sha1-file: pass git_hash_algo to write_object_file_prepare()
 + streaming: allow open_istream() to handle any repo
 + pack-check: use given repo's hash_algo at verify_packfile()
 + cache-tree: use given repo's hash_algo at verify_one()
 + diff: make diff_populate_filespec() honor its repo argument

 Some codepaths were given a repository instance as a parameter to
 work in the repository, but passed the_repository instance to its
 callees, which has been cleaned up (somewhat).


* pk/status-of-uncloned-submodule (2020-02-04) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-07 at f6349f5f5f)
 + t7400: testcase for submodule status on unregistered inner git repos
 + submodule: fix status of initialized but not cloned submodules
 + t7400: add a testcase for submodule status on empty dirs

 The way "git submodule status" reports an initialized but not yet
 populated submodule has not been reimplemented correctly when a
 part of the "git submodule" command was rewritten in C, which has
 been corrected.


* rs/name-rev-memsave (2020-02-05) 11 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-11 at 17616cb9b1)
 + name-rev: sort tip names before applying
 + name-rev: release unused name strings
 + name-rev: generate name strings only if they are better
 + name-rev: pre-size buffer in get_parent_name()
 + name-rev: factor out get_parent_name()
 + name-rev: put struct rev_name into commit slab
 + name-rev: don't _peek() in create_or_update_name()
 + name-rev: don't leak path copy in name_ref()
 + name-rev: respect const qualifier
 + name-rev: remove unused typedef
 + name-rev: rewrite create_or_update_name()

 Memory footprint and performance of "git name-rev" has been
 improved.


* rs/parse-options-concat-dup (2020-02-10) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-11 at a1685687ab)
 + parse-options: simplify parse_options_dup()
 + parse-options: const parse_options_concat() parameters
 + parse-options: factor out parse_options_count()
 + parse-options: use COPY_ARRAY in parse_options_concat()

 Code clean-up.


* rs/strbuf-insertstr (2020-02-10) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-11 at 5c89aa002f)
 + mailinfo: don't insert header prefix for handle_content_type()
 + strbuf: add and use strbuf_insertstr()
 (this branch is used by jk/mailinfo-cleanup.)

 Code clean-up.


* tb/commit-graph-object-dir (2020-02-04) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-07 at 5c85173df4)
 + commit-graph.h: use odb in 'load_commit_graph_one_fd_st'
 + commit-graph.c: remove path normalization, comparison
 + commit-graph.h: store object directory in 'struct commit_graph'
 + commit-graph.h: store an odb in 'struct write_commit_graph_context'
 + t5318: don't pass non-object directory to '--object-dir'
 (this branch is used by tb/commit-graph-split-merge.)

 The code to compute the commit-graph has been taught to use a more
 robust way to tell if two object directories refer to the same
 thing.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* jk/object-filter-with-bitmap (2020-02-14) 15 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-16 at 42425c3658)
 + pack-objects: support filters with bitmaps
 + pack-bitmap: implement BLOB_LIMIT filtering
 + pack-bitmap: implement BLOB_NONE filtering
 + bitmap: add bitmap_unset() function
 + rev-list: use bitmap filters for traversal
 + pack-bitmap: basic noop bitmap filter infrastructure
 + rev-list: allow commit-only bitmap traversals
 + t5310: factor out bitmap traversal comparison
 + rev-list: allow bitmaps when counting objects
 + rev-list: make --count work with --objects
 + rev-list: factor out bitmap-optimized routines
 + pack-bitmap: refuse to do a bitmap traversal with pathspecs
 + rev-list: fallback to non-bitmap traversal when filtering
 + pack-bitmap: fix leak of haves/wants object lists
 + pack-bitmap: factor out type iterator initialization

 The object reachability bitmap machinery and the partial cloning
 machinery were not prepared to work well together, because some
 object-filtering criteria partial clones use inherently rely on
 object traversal, but the bitmap machinery is an optimization to
 bypass that object traversal.  There however are some cases that
 they can work together, and they were taught about this case.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* hw/advise-ng (2020-02-16) 2 commits
 - advice: extract vadvise() from advise()
 - advice: refactor advise API

 Revamping of the advise API to allow more systematic enumeration of
 advice knobs in the future.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* pw/advise-rebase-skip (2019-12-06) 9 commits
 - rebase -i: leave CHERRY_PICK_HEAD when there are conflicts
 - rebase: fix advice when a fixup creates an empty commit
 - commit: give correct advice for empty commit during a rebase
 - commit: encapsulate determine_whence() for sequencer
 - commit: use enum value for multiple cherry-picks
 - sequencer: write CHERRY_PICK_HEAD for reword and edit
 - cherry-pick: check commit error messages
 - cherry-pick: add test for `--skip` advice in `git commit`
 - t3404: use test_cmp_rev

 The mechanism to prevent "git commit" from making an empty commit
 or amending during an interrupted cherry-pick was broken during the
 rewrite of "git rebase" in C, which has been corrected.

 What's the status of this one?
 The tip two are still RFC.


* vn/reset-deleted-ita (2019-07-26) 1 commit
 - reset: unstage empty deleted ita files

 "git reset HEAD [<pathspec>]" did not reset an empty file that was
 added with the intent-to-add bit.

 Expecting a reroll.


* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2018-10-15) 1 commit
 - zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* ds/sparse-add (2020-02-11) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-14 at 3799757bbe)
 + sparse-checkout: work with Windows paths
 + sparse-checkout: create 'add' subcommand
 + sparse-checkout: extract pattern update from 'set' subcommand
 + sparse-checkout: extract add_patterns_from_input()

 "git sparse-checkout" learned a new "add" subcommand.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* at/rebase-fork-point-regression-fix (2020-02-11) 1 commit
 - rebase: --fork-point regression fix

 The "--fork-point" mode of "git rebase" regressed when the command
 was rewritten in C back in 2.20 era, which has been corrected.

 Was waiting for discussion to settle.

 - bloom: core Bloom filter implementation for changed paths
 - commit-graph: use MAX_NUM_CHUNKS

 Introduce an extension to the commit-graph to make it efficient to
 check for the paths that were modified at each commit using Bloom
 filters.

 Will be rerolled with bytesex fixes squashed in.
 Breakage due to byte-order dependency reported.

 - bisect--helper: convert `vocab_*` char pointers to char arrays

 Underlying machinery of "git bisect--helper" is being refactored
 into pieces that are more easily reused.


* bw/remote-rename-update-config (2020-02-10) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-14 at 30b1a477de)
 + remote rename/remove: gently handle remote.pushDefault config

 "git remote rename X Y" needs to adjust configuration variables
 (e.g. branch.<name>.remote) whose value used to be X to Y.
 branch.<name>.pushRemote is now also updated.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* es/bright-colors (2020-02-11) 3 commits

* bk/p4-pre-edit-changelist (2020-02-14) 7 commits
 - git-p4: add RCS keyword status message
 - git-p4: add p4 submit hooks
 - git-p4: restructure code in submit
 - git-p4: add --no-verify option
 - git-p4: add p4-pre-submit exit text
 - git-p4: create new function run_git_hook
 - git-p4: rewrite prompt to be Windows compatible

 "git p4" learned four new hooks and also "--no-verify" option to
 bypass them (and the existing "p4-pre-submit" hook).

 Waiting for response to RFH from Windows/Python folks.
 cf. <pull.698.v6.git.git.1581691486.gitgitgadget@gmail.com>


* en/fill-directory-exponential (2020-01-31) 6 commits
 - t7063: blindly accept diffs
 - dir: replace exponential algorithm with a linear one
 - dir: refactor treat_directory to clarify control flow
 - dir: fix confusion based on variable tense
 - dir: fix broken comment
 - dir: consolidate treat_path() and treat_one_path()

 The directory traversal code had redundant recursive calls which
 made its performance characteristics exponential wrt the depth of
 the tree, which was corrected.

 Still RFC?

* tb/commit-graph-split-merge (2020-02-12) 3 commits
 - builtin/commit-graph.c: support '--input=none'
 - builtin/commit-graph.c: introduce '--input=<source>'
 - builtin/commit-graph.c: support '--split[=<strategy>]'

 The code to write out the commit-graph has been taught a few
 options to control if the resulting graph chains should be merged
 or a single new incremental graph is created.

 Waiting for the discussion to settle.

* en/rebase-backend (2020-02-16) 20 commits
 - rebase: rename the two primary rebase backends
 - rebase: change the default backend from "am" to "merge"
 - rebase: make the backend configurable via config setting
 - rebase tests: repeat some tests using the merge backend instead of am
 - rebase tests: mark tests specific to the am-backend with --am
 - rebase: drop '-i' from the reflog for interactive-based rebases
 - git-prompt: change the prompt for interactive-based rebases
 - rebase: add an --am option
 - rebase: move incompatibility checks between backend options a bit earlier
 - git-rebase.txt: add more details about behavioral differences of backends
 - rebase: allow more types of rebases to fast-forward
 - t3432: make these tests work with either am or merge backends
 - rebase: fix handling of restrict_revision
 - rebase: make sure to pass along the quiet flag to the sequencer
 - rebase, sequencer: remove the broken GIT_QUIET handling
 - t3406: simplify an already simple test
 - rebase (interactive-backend): fix handling of commits that become empty
 - rebase (interactive-backend): make --keep-empty the default
 - t3404: directly test the behavior of interest
 - git-rebase.txt: update description of --allow-empty-message

 "git rebase" has learned to use the sequencer backend by default,
 while allowing "--am" option to go back to the traditional "am"
 backend.

 The last step may be rushing things a bit and may want to be
 taken separately.
