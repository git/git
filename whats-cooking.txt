What's cooking in git.git (Jun 2017, #08; Wed, 28)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

 - Documentation/clone: document ignored configuration variables
 - clone: respect additional configured fetch refspecs during initial fetch
 (this branch is used by sg/remote-no-string-refspecs.)

 "git clone -c var=val" is a way to set configuration variables in
 the resulting repository, but it is more useful to also make these
 variables take effect while the initial clone is happening,
 e.g. these configuration variables could be fetch refspecs.

* ab/wildmatch (2017-06-23) 1 commit
 - wildmatch: remove unused wildopts parameter

 Prepare the wildmatch API for future enhancements to allow a
 pattern that is repeatedly matched against many strings to be
 precompiled.


* ah/doc-pretty-color-auto-prefix (2017-06-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-06-26 at d7489fc831)
 + doc: clarify syntax for %C(auto,...) in pretty formats

 Doc update.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* cc/shared-index-permfix (2017-06-25) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-06-26 at bb41584bf0)
 + t1700: make sure split-index respects core.sharedrepository
 + t1301: move modebits() to test-lib-functions.sh
 + read-cache: use shared perms when writing shared index

 The split index code did not honor core.sharedrepository setting
 correctly.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ex/deprecate-empty-pathspec-as-match-all (2017-06-23) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-06-26 at d026281517)
 + pathspec: die on empty strings as pathspec
 + t0027: do not use an empty string as a pathspec element

 The final step to make an empty string as a pathspec element
 illegal.  We started this by first deprecating and warning a
 pathspec that has such an element in 2.11 (Nov 2016).

 Hopefully we can merge this down to the 'master' by the end of the
 year?  A deprecation warning period that is about 1 year does not
 sound too bad.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* sb/pull-rebase-submodule (2017-06-27) 4 commits
 - builtin/fetch cleanup: always set default value for submodule recursing
 - pull: optionally rebase submodules (remote submodule changes only)
 - builtin/fetch: parse recurse-submodules-default at default options parsing
 - builtin/fetch: factor submodule recurse parsing out to submodule config

 "git pull --rebase --recurse-submodules" learns to rebase the
 branch in the submodules to an updated base.


* ab/die-errors-in-threaded (2017-06-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-06-24 at 135fc4b963)
 + die(): stop hiding errors due to overzealous recursion guard

 Traditionally, the default die() routine had a code to prevent it
 from getting called multiple times, which interacted badly when a
 threaded program used it (one downside is that the real error may
 be hidden and instead the only error message given to the user may
 end up being "die recursion detected", which is not very useful).

 Will merge to 'master'.


* bw/repo-object (2017-06-23) 21 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-06-26 at ed9c0b77c3)
 + ls-files: use repository object
 + repository: enable initialization of submodules
 + submodule: convert is_submodule_initialized to work on a repository
 + submodule: add repo_read_gitmodules

 + config: read config from a repository object
 + path: add repo_worktree_path and strbuf_repo_worktree_path
 + path: add repo_git_path and strbuf_repo_git_path
 + path: worktree_git_path() should not use file relocation
 + path: convert do_git_path to take a 'struct repository'
 + path: convert strbuf_git_common_path to take a 'struct repository'
 + path: always pass in commondir to update_common_dir
 + path: create path.h
 + environment: store worktree in the_repository
 + environment: place key repository state in the_repository
 + repository: introduce the repository object
 + environment: remove namespace_len variable
 + setup: add comment indicating a hack
 + setup: don't perform lazy initialization of repository state
 + Merge branches 'bw/ls-files-sans-the-index' and 'bw/config-h' into bw/repo-object

 Introduce a "repository" object to eventually make it easier to
 work in multiple repositories (the primary focus is to work with
 the superproject and its submodules) in a single process.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ks/submodule-add-doc (2017-06-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-06-24 at 26309b38f2)
 + Documentation/git-submodule: cleanup "add" section

 Doc update.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* pw/unquote-path-in-git-pm (2017-06-24) 5 commits
 - git-add--interactive.perl: Use unquote_path() from Git.pm
 - Add tests for Git::unquote_path()
 - Git::unquote_path() throw an exception on bad path
 - Git::unquote_path() Handle '\a'
 - Git.pm: add unquote_path()

 Code refactoring.

 Expecting a reroll.
 The structure of the series has a bit to be desired, but the end
 result looked mostly OK.


* rs/sha1-name-readdir-optim (2017-06-24) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-06-26 at a70587f2b9)
 + sha1_file: guard against invalid loose subdirectory numbers
 + sha1_file: let for_each_file_in_obj_subdir() handle subdir names
 + p4205: add perf test script for pretty log formats
 + sha1_name: cache readdir(3) results in find_short_object_filename()

 Optimize "what are the object names already taken in an alternate
 object database?" query that is used to derive the length of prefix
 an object name is uniquely abbreviated to.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jt/unify-object-info (2017-06-26) 8 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-06-26 at 540ea81983)
 + sha1_file: refactor has_sha1_file_with_flags
 + sha1_file: do not access pack if unneeded

 + sha1_file: refactor read_object
 + sha1_file: move delta base cache code up
 + sha1_file: rename LOOKUP_REPLACE_OBJECT

 + sha1_file: teach packed_object_info about typename

 Code clean-ups.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ks/status-initial-commit (2017-06-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-06-24 at 940ffd5816)
 + status: contextually notify user about an initial commit

 "git status" has long shown essentially the same message as "git
 commit"; the message it gives while preparing for the root commit,
 i.e. "Initial commit", was hard to understand for some new users.
 Now it says "No commits yet" to stress more on the current status
 (rather than the commit the user is preparing for, which is more in
 line with the focus of "git commit").

 Will merge to 'master'.


* mh/packed-ref-store (2017-06-23) 29 commits
 - read_packed_refs(): die if `packed-refs` contains bogus data
 - repack_without_refs(): don't lock or unlock the packed refs
 - commit_packed_refs(): remove call to `packed_refs_unlock()`
 - clear_packed_ref_cache(): don't protest if the lock is held
 - packed_refs_unlock(), packed_refs_is_locked(): new functions
 - packed_refs_lock(): report errors via a `struct strbuf *err`
 - packed_refs_lock(): function renamed from lock_packed_refs()

 - packed_peel_ref(): new function, extracted from `files_peel_ref()`
 - repack_without_refs(): take a `packed_ref_store *` parameter
 - get_packed_ref(): take a `packed_ref_store *` parameter
 - rollback_packed_refs(): take a `packed_ref_store *` parameter
 - commit_packed_refs(): take a `packed_ref_store *` parameter
 - lock_packed_refs(): take a `packed_ref_store *` parameter
 - add_packed_ref(): take a `packed_ref_store *` parameter
 - get_packed_refs(): take a `packed_ref_store *` parameter
 - get_packed_ref_cache(): take a `packed_ref_store *` parameter

 The "ref-store" code reorganization continues.

 Is this now ready for 'next'?


* sb/submodule-doc (2017-06-22) 1 commit
 - submodules: overhaul documentation

 Doc update.

 Waiting for discussion to settle.


* sd/branch-copy (2017-06-18) 3 commits
 - branch: add a --copy (-c) option to go with --move (-m)
 - branch: add test for -m renaming multiple config sections
 - config: create a function to format section headers

 "git branch" learned "-c/-C" to create and switch to a new branch
 by copying an existing one.

 Has a bit of interaction with mh/packed-ref-store and bw/config-h,
 so perhaps needs to wait for the former to stabilize a bit more
 and possibly rebasing on them.


* ls/filter-process-delayed (2017-06-27) 6 commits
 - convert: add "status=delayed" to filter process protocol
 - convert: move multiple file filter error handling to separate function
 - convert: put the flags field before the flag itself for consistent style
 - t0021: write "OUT <size>" only on success
 - t0021: make debug log file name configurable
 - t0021: keep filter log files on comparison

 The filter-process interface learned to allow a process with long
 latency give a "delayed" response.

 Getting reviewed.

  (merged to 'next' on 2017-06-22 at d1dde1672a)
 + rebase: add more regression tests for console output
 + rebase: add regression tests for console output
 + rebase -i: add test for reflog message
 + sequencer: print autostash messages to stderr

 Fix a recent regression to "git rebase -i" and add tests that would
 have caught it and others.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ab/sha1dc (2017-06-27) 3 commits
 - sha1collisiondetection: automatically enable when submodule is populated
 - sha1dc: optionally use sha1collisiondetection as a submodule
 - sha1dc: correct endian detection for Solaris (and others?)

 The "collission-detecting" implementation of SHA-1 hash we borrowed
 from is replaced by directly binding the upstream project as our
 submodule.  Glitches on minority platforms are still being worked out.

 Will keep in 'pu'.


* bp/fsmonitor (2017-06-12) 6 commits
 - fsmonitor: add a sample query-fsmonitor hook script for Watchman
 - fsmonitor: add documentation for the fsmonitor extension.
 - fsmonitor: add test cases for fsmonitor extension
 - fsmonitor: teach git to optionally utilize a file system monitor to speed up detecting new or changed files.
 - dir: make lookup_untracked() available outside of dir.c
 - bswap: add 64 bit endianness helper get_be64

 We learned to talk to watchman to speed up "git status".

 - diff.c: move line ending check into emit_hunk_header
 - diff.c: readability fix

 "git diff" has been taught to optionally paint new lines that are
 the same as deleted lines elsewhere differently from genuinely new
 lines.

 Expecting an evantual reroll.

 "git gc" and friends when multiple worktrees are used off of a
 single repository did not consider the index and per-worktree refs
 of other worktrees as the root for reachability traversal, making
 objects that are in use only in other worktrees to be subject to
 garbage collection.
