What's cooking in git.git (Dec 2021, #05; Thu, 23)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen',
which means nothing more than that I have found them of interest for
some reason (like "it may have hard-to-resolve conflicts with
another topic already in flight" or "this may turn out to be
useful").  Do not read too much into a topic being in (or not in)
'seen'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of the
integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/

 Code clean-up.

* ab/fetch-set-upstream-while-detached (2021-12-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-12-15 at d0406f880a)
 + pull, fetch: fix segfault in --set-upstream option

 "git fetch --set-upstream" did not check if there is a current
 branch, leading to a segfault when it is run on a detached HEAD,
 which has been corrected.
 source: <patch-v5-1.1-69ab40d623b-20211207T215115Z-avarab@gmail.com>


* ak/protect-any-current-branch (2021-12-01) 8 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-12-10 at dd2c6a557c)
 + branch: protect branches checked out in all worktrees
 + receive-pack: protect current branch for bare repository worktree
 + receive-pack: clean dead code from update_worktree()
 + fetch: protect branches checked out in all worktrees
 + worktree: simplify find_shared_symref() memory ownership model
 + branch: lowercase error messages
 + receive-pack: lowercase error messages
 + fetch: lowercase error messages

 "git fetch" without the "--update-head-ok" option ought to protect
 a checked out branch from getting updated, to prevent the working
 tree that checks it out to go out of sync.  The code was written
 before the use of "git worktree" got widespread, and only checked
 the branch that was checked out in the current worktree, which has
 been updated.

 GIT_WORK_TREE environment variables when the command was rewritten

 When the http-backend program, which is the server-side component

 deliberately did not say anything to the requesting client.  We now
 send a message back to the browser to tell the user that they do
 not want to visit the URL via their browser, instead of a totally
 blank page.

* jh/p4-rcs-expansion-in-bytestring (2021-12-16) 5 commits
 - git-p4: resolve RCS keywords in bytes not utf-8
 - git-p4: open temporary patch file for write only
 - git-p4: add raw option to read_pipelines
 - git-p4: pre-compile RCS keyword regexes
 - git-p4: use with statements to close files after use in patchRCSKeywords

 The RCS keyword substitution in "git p4" used to be done assuming
 that the contents are UTF-8 text, which can trigger decoding
 errors.  We now treat the contents as a bytestring for robustness
 and correctness.

 - unpack-trees: add special cwd handling
 - unpack-trees: refuse to remove startup_info->original_cwd

 Many git commands that deal with working tree files try to remove a
 directory that becomes empty (i.e. "git switch" from a branch that
 has the directory to another branch that does not would attempt
 remove all files in the directory and the directory itself).  This
 drops users into an unfamiliar situation if the command was run in
 a subdirectory that becomes subject to removal due to the command.
 The commands have been taught to keep an empty directory if it is
 the directory they were started in to avoid surprising users.

 Further tweaks on progress API.

 Needs review.
