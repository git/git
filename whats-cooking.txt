What's cooking in git.git (Feb 2015, #02; Thu, 5)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.

Git 2.3 is out.  I'll wait for some time for the dust to settle and
then rewind and rebuild 'next'.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* jc/diff-files-ita (2015-02-04) 1 commit
 - run_diff_files(): clarify computation of sha1 validity

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/config-no-ungetc-eof (2015-02-05) 2 commits
 - config_buf_ungetc: warn when pushing back a random character
 - config: do not ungetc EOF

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/decimal-width-for-uintmax (2015-02-05) 1 commit
 - decimal_width: avoid integer overflow

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ss/check-builtins-on-windows (2015-02-05) 1 commit
 - check-builtins: strip executable suffix $X when enumerating builtins

 Will merge to 'next'.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* jn/doc-api-errors (2014-12-04) 1 commit
 - doc: document error handling functions and conventions

 For discussion.


* pw/remote-set-url-fetch (2014-11-26) 1 commit
 - remote: add --fetch and --both options to set-url

 Expecting a reroll.


* ms/submodule-update-config-doc (2014-11-03) 1 commit
 - submodule: clarify documentation for update subcommand

 Needs a reroll ($gmane/259037).


* je/quiltimport-no-fuzz (2014-10-21) 2 commits
 - git-quiltimport: flip the default not to allow fuzz
 - git-quiltimport.sh: allow declining fuzz with --exact option

 "quiltimport" drove "git apply" always with -C1 option to reduce
 context of the patch in order to give more chance to somewhat stale
 patches to apply.  Add an "--exact" option to disable, and also
 "-C$n" option to customize this behaviour.  The top patch
 optionally flips the default to "--exact".

 Tired of waiting for an Ack; will discard.


* tr/remerge-diff (2014-11-10) 9 commits
 - t4213: avoid "|" in sed regexp
 - log --remerge-diff: show what the conflict resolution changed
 - name-hash: allow dir hashing even when !ignore_case
 - merge-recursive: allow storing conflict hunks in index
 - merge_diff_mode: fold all merge diff variants into an enum
 - combine-diff: do not pass revs->dense_combined_merges redundantly
 - merge-recursive: -Xindex-only to leave worktree unchanged
 - merge-recursive: internal flag to avoid touching the worktree
 - merge-recursive: remove dead conditional in update_stages()

 "log -p" output learns a new way to let users inspect a merge
 commit by showing the differences between the automerged result
 with conflicts the person who recorded the merge would have seen
 and the final conflict resolution that was recorded in the merge.

 Waiting for a reroll ($gmane/256591).


* hv/submodule-config (2014-11-11) 4 commits
 - do not die on error of parsing fetchrecursesubmodules option
 - use new config API for worktree configurations of submodules
 - extract functions for submodule config set and lookup
 - implement submodule config cache for lookup of submodule names

 Kicked back to 'pu' per request ($gmane/255610).


* ab/add-interactive-show-diff-func-name (2014-05-12) 2 commits
 - SQUASH??? git-add--interactive: Preserve diff heading when splitting hunks
 - git-add--interactive: Preserve diff heading when splitting hunks

 Waiting for a reroll.


* jn/gitweb-utf8-in-links (2014-05-27) 1 commit
 - gitweb: Harden UTF-8 handling in generated links

 $gmane/250758?


* ss/userdiff-update-csharp-java (2014-06-02) 2 commits
 - userdiff: support Java try keyword
 - userdiff: support C# async methods and correct C# keywords

 Reviews sent; waiting for a response.


* bg/rebase-off-of-previous-branch (2014-04-16) 1 commit
 - git-rebase: print name of rev when using shorthand

 Teach "git rebase -" to report the concrete name of the branch
 (i.e. the previous one).

 But it stops short and does not do the same for "git rebase @{-1}".
 Expecting a reroll.


* rb/merge-prepare-commit-msg-hook (2014-01-10) 4 commits
 - merge: drop unused arg from abort_commit method signature
 - merge: make prepare_to_commit responsible for write_merge_state
 - t7505: ensure cleanup after hook blocks merge
 - t7505: add missing &&

 Expose more merge states (e.g. $GIT_DIR/MERGE_MODE) to hooks that
 run during "git merge".  The log message stresses too much on one
 hook, prepare-commit-msg, but it would equally apply to other hooks
 like post-merge, I think.

 Waiting for a reroll.


* jc/graph-post-root-gap (2013-12-30) 3 commits
 - WIP: document what we want at the end
 - graph: remove unused code a bit
 - graph: stuff the current commit into graph->columns[]

 This was primarily a RFH ($gmane/239580).


* tg/perf-lib-test-perf-cleanup (2013-09-19) 2 commits
 - perf-lib: add test_perf_cleanup target
 - perf-lib: split starting the test from the execution

 Add test_perf_cleanup shell function to the perf suite, that allows
 the script writers to define a test with a clean-up action.

 Will hold.


* jc/show-branch (2014-03-24) 5 commits
 - show-branch: use commit slab to represent bitflags of arbitrary width
 - show-branch.c: remove "all_mask"
 - show-branch.c: abstract out "flags" operation
 - show-branch.c: lift all_mask/all_revs to a global static
 - show-branch.c: update comment style

 Waiting for the final step to lift the hard-limit before sending it out.

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* jc/diff-format-doc (2015-01-28) 1 commit
 - diff-format doc: a score can follow M for rewrite

 The documentation incorrectly said that C(opy) and R(ename) are the
 only ones that can be followed by the score number in the output in
 the --raw format.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/remote-curl-an-array-in-struct-cannot-be-null (2015-01-28) 1 commit
 - do not check truth value of flex arrays

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/status-read-branch-name-fix (2015-01-28) 1 commit
 - read_and_strip_branch: fix typo'd address-of operator

 Code to read branch name from various files in .git/ directory
 would have misbehaved if the code to write them left an empty file.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ch/new-gpg-drops-rfc-1991 (2015-01-29) 2 commits
 - t/lib-gpg: sanity-check that we can actually sign
 - t/lib-gpg: include separate public keys in keyring.gpg

 Older GnuPG implementation may not correctly import the keyring
 material we prepare for the tests to use.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jc/apply-beyond-symlink (2015-02-03) 4 commits
 - apply: do not touch a file beyond a symbolic link
 - apply: do not read from beyond a symbolic link
 - apply: do not read from the filesystem under --index
 - apply: reject input that touches outside the working area

 "git apply" was not very careful about reading from, removing,
 updating and creating paths outside the working tree (under
 --index/--cached) or the current directory (when used as a
 replacement for GNU patch).

 May need to re-review the tests.


* jc/diff-b-m (2015-02-01) 1 commit
 - diff: do not use creation-half of -B as a rename target candidate

 "git diff -B -M" produced incorrect patch when the postimage of a
 completely rewritten file is similar to the preimage of a removed
 file; such a resulting file must not be expressed as a rename from
 other place.

 The fix in this patch is broken, unfortunately.


* jc/remote-set-url-doc (2015-01-29) 1 commit
 - Documentation/git-remote.txt: stress that set-url is not for triangular

 Clarify in the documentation that "remote.<nick>.pushURL" and
 "remote.<nick>.URL" are there to name the same repository accessed
 via different transports, not two separate repositories.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jc/t4122-use-test-write-lines (2015-01-28) 1 commit
 - t4122: use test_write_lines from test-lib-functions

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/pack-bitmap (2015-02-04) 1 commit
 - ewah: fix building with gcc < 3.4.0

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/prune-mtime (2015-02-02) 1 commit
 - sha1_file: fix iterating loose alternate objects

 In v2.2.0, we broke "git prune" that runs in a repository that
 borrows from an alternate object store.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ps/submodule-sanitize-path-upon-add (2015-02-02) 1 commit
 - git-submodule.sh: fix '/././' path normalization

 Will merge to 'next'.


* tc/curl-vernum-output-broken-in-7.11 (2015-02-03) 1 commit
 - Makefile: handle broken curl version number in version check

 Cope with irregular output of "curl-config --vernum" given by
 certain older vintages of cURL.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* tc/missing-http-proxyauth (2015-02-03) 1 commit
 - http: support curl < 7.10.7

 Will merge to 'next'.


* tc/t9001-noxmailer (2015-01-30) 1 commit
 - t9001: use older Getopt::Long boolean prefix '--no' rather than '--no-'

 Kyle's update to explicitly support --no-option with older
 Getopt::Long ($gmane/263203) might be a better alternative
 if we have to support them in the longer term.


* jc/apply-ws-fix-expands-report (2015-01-22) 1 commit
 - apply: detect and mark whitespace errors in context lines when fixing
 (this branch uses jc/apply-ws-fix-expands.)

 "git apply --whitespace=fix" fixed whitespace errors in the common
 context lines but did so without reporting.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ks/rebase-i-abbrev (2015-01-22) 1 commit
 - rebase -i: use full object name internally throughout the script

 The insn sheet "git rebase -i" creates did not fully honor
 core.abbrev settings.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* mh/deref-symref-over-helper-transport (2015-01-21) 1 commit
 - transport-helper: do not request symbolic refs to remote helpers

 "git fetch" over a remote-helper that cannot respond to "list"
 command could not fetch from a symbolic reference e.g. HEAD.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ak/add-i-empty-candidates (2015-01-22) 1 commit
 - add -i: return from list_and_choose if there is no candidate

 The interactive "show a list and let the user choose from it"
 interface "add -i" used showed and prompted to the user even when
 the candidate list was empty, against which the only "choice" the
 user could have made was to choose nothing.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* av/wincred-with-at-in-username-fix (2015-01-25) 1 commit
 - wincred: fix get credential if username has "@"

 Will merge to 'next'.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/dumb-http-idx-fetch-fix (2015-01-27) 1 commit
 - dumb-http: do not pass NULL path to parse_pack_index

 Will merge to 'next'.

  (merged to 'next' on 2015-01-23 at ed972d3)

 Will merge to 'master'.

 - apply: count the size of postimage correctly
 - apply: make update_pre_post_images() sanity check the given postlen
 - apply.c: typofix
 (this branch is used by jc/apply-ws-fix-expands-report.)

 "git apply --whitespace=fix" used to under-allocate the memory
 when the fix resulted in a longer text than the original patch.

 Will merge to 'next'.

  (merged to 'next' on 2015-01-22 at 3c96639)

 (this branch uses mh/reflog-expire and sb/atomic-push.)

 I had to wiggle this in and am not confident I did it correctly.

 Need extra set of eyes to review this.

 After attempting and failing a password-less authentication
 (e.g. kerberos), libcURL refuses to fall back to password based
 Basic authentication without a bit of help/encouragement.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* bp/diff-relative-config (2015-01-07) 2 commits
 - diff: teach diff.relative to give default to --relative=<value>
 - diff: teach --no-relative to override earlier --relative


* dk/format-patch-ignore-diff-submodule (2015-01-07) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-01-12 at 6b4605b)
 + format-patch: ignore diff.submodule setting
 + t4255: test am submodule with diff.submodule

 Setting diff.submodule to 'log' made "git format-patch" produce

 Will cook in 'next'.

 - attr: do not attempt to expand when we know it's not a macro

 + log: teach --invert-grep option

 Will cook in 'next'.


* km/gettext-n (2015-01-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-01-12 at 0cbbf4a)
 + gettext.h: add parentheses around N_ expansion if supported

 Will cook in 'next'.


* jn/rerere-fail-on-auto-update-failure (2015-01-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-01-12 at 313c449)
 + rerere: error out on autoupdate failure

 "git rerere" (invoked internally from many mergy operations) did
 not correctly signal errors when told to update the working tree
 files and failed to do so for whatever reason.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* sb/atomic-push (2015-01-14) 11 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-01-14 at 12c4e28)

 + receive-pack.c: shorten the execute_commands loop over all commands
 (this branch is used by sb/atomic-push-fix; uses mh/reflog-expire.)

 "git push" has been taught a "--atomic" option that makes push to
 update more than one ref an "all-or-none" affair.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* mh/reflog-expire (2014-12-22) 24 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-01-12 at 12a7dff)
 + refs.c: let fprintf handle the formatting

 + refs.c: add a function to append a reflog entry to a fd
 + refs.c: make ref_transaction_delete a wrapper for ref_transaction_update
 + refs.c: make ref_transaction_create a wrapper for ref_transaction_update
 (this branch is used by sb/atomic-push and sb/atomic-push-fix.)

 Restructure "reflog expire" to fit the reflogs better with the
 recently updated ref API.

 Looked reasonable (except that some shortlog entries stood out like
 a sore thumb).

 Will cook in 'next'.


* jc/push-to-checkout (2015-01-08) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-01-12 at e64df63)
 + receive-pack: support push-to-checkout hook
 + receive-pack: refactor updateInstead codepath

 Extending the js/push-to-deploy topic, the behaviour of "git push"
 when updating the working tree and the index with an update to the
 branch that is checked out can be tweaked by push-to-checkout hook.

 Will cook in 'next'.
