What's cooking in git.git (Sep 2023, #06; Tue, 19)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and
aren't considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL
to a message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity (of course they can be resubmit when new interests
arise).

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/

* js/complete-checkout-t (2023-09-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2023-09-08 at 461bb28fbd)
 + completion(switch/checkout): treat --track and -t the same

 The completion script (in contrib/) has been taught to treat the
 "-t" option to "git checkout" and "git switch" just like the
 "--track" option, to complete remote-tracking branches.

 "git grep -e A --no-or -e B" is accepted, even though the negation
 of "or" did not mean anything, which has been tightened.

 The optimization based on fsmonitor in the "diff --cached"
 codepath is resurrected with the "fake-lstat" introduced earlier.

 It is unknown if the optimization is worth resurrecting, but in case...

 - rebase -i: ignore signals when forking subprocesses

 If the commit log editor or other external programs (spawned via
 "exec" insn in the todo list) receive internactive signal during
 "git rebase -i", it caused not just the spawned program but the
 "Git" process that spawned them, which is often not what the end
 user intended.  "git" learned to ignore SIGINT and SIGQUIT while
 waiting for these subprocesses.
