[Graduated to "master"]

* fc/completion (2013-04-14) 8 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-14 at a509746)
 + completion: small optimization
 + completion: inline __gitcomp_1 to its sole callsite
 + completion: get rid of compgen
 + completion: add __gitcomp_nl tests
 + completion: add new __gitcompadd helper
 + completion: get rid of empty COMPREPLY assignments
 + completion: trivial test improvement
 + completion: add more cherry-pick options

 In addition to a user visible change to offer more options to

 + log: update to OPT_BOOL
 + format-patch: refactor branch name calculation
 + format-patch: improve head calculation for cover-letter
 + send-email: make annotate configurable

 Allows format-patch --cover-letter to be configurable; the most
 notable is the "auto" mode to create cover-letter only for multi
 patch series.


* jc/detached-head-doc (2013-04-05) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-14 at 24b9271)

  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-15 at 4bfa834)
 + http-backend: respect GIT_NAMESPACE with dumb clients

 Allow smart-capable HTTP servers to be restricted via the
 GIT_NAMESPACE mechanism when talking with commit-walker clients
 (they already do so when talking with smart HTTP clients).


* jk/http-error-messages (2013-04-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-16 at 4a32517)
 + http: set curl FAILONERROR each time we select a handle

 A regression fix for the recently graduated topic.

  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-15 at 35fd4b9)
 + merge-tree: don't print entries that match "local"

 The resolution of some corner cases by "git merge-tree" were
 inconsistent between top-of-the-tree and in a subdirectory.


* jk/test-trash (2013-04-14) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-15 at 15a6624)

 + t5004: fix issue with empty archive test and bsdtar

 Implementations of "tar" of BSD descend have found to have trouble
 with reading an otherwise empty tar archive with pax headers and
 causes an unnecessary test failure.


* th/t9903-symlinked-workdir (2013-04-11) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-15 at f062dc6)
 + t9903: Don't fail when run from path accessed through symlink


* tr/packed-object-info-wo-recursion (2013-03-27) 3 commits

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* jk/a-thread-only-dies-once (2013-04-16) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-18 at 3208f44)
 + run-command: use thread-aware die_is_recursing routine
 + usage: allow pluggable die-recursion checks

 A regression fix for the logic to detect die() handler triggering
 itself recursively.

 Will fast-track to 'master'.


* tr/copy-revisions-from-stdin (2013-04-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-16 at d882870)
 + read_revisions_from_stdin: make copies for handle_revision_arg

 A fix to a long-standing issue in the command line parser for
 revisions, which was triggered by mv/sequence-pick-error-diag topic
 (now in 'next').

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/prune-all (2013-04-18) 3 commits
 - api-parse-options.txt: document "no-" for non-boolean options
 - git-gc.txt, git-reflog.txt: document new expiry options
 - date.c: add parse_expiry_date()

 We used the approxidate() parser for "--expire=<timestamp>" options
 of various commands, but it is better to treat --expire=all and
 --expire=now a bit more specially than using the current timestamp.
 Update "git gc" and "git reflog" with a new parsing function for
 expiry dates.


* jk/chopped-ident (2013-04-17) 3 commits
 - blame: handle broken commit headers gracefully
 - pretty: handle broken commit headers gracefully
 - cat-file: print tags raw for "cat-file -p"

 A commit object whose author or committer ident are malformed
 crashed some code that trusted that a name, an email and an
 timestamp can always be found in it.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* rt/commentchar-fmt-merge-msg (2013-04-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-18 at 96799bd)
 + t6200: avoid path mangling issue on Windows

 A test fix for recent update.

 Will fast-track to 'master'.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* jc/format-patch (2013-02-21) 2 commits
 - format-patch: --inline-single
 - format-patch: rename "no_inline" field

 A new option to send a single patch to the standard output to be
 appended at the bottom of a message.  I personally have no need for
 this, but it was easy enough to cobble together.  Tests, docs and
 stripping out more MIMEy stuff are left as exercises to interested
 parties.

 Not ready for inclusion.


* jk/gitweb-utf8 (2013-04-08) 4 commits
 - gitweb: Fix broken blob action parameters on blob/commitdiff pages
 - gitweb: Don't append ';js=(0|1)' to external links
 - gitweb: Make feed title valid utf8
 - gitweb: Fix utf8 encoding for blob_plain, blobdiff_plain, commitdiff_plain, and patch

 Various fixes to gitweb.

 Waiting for a reroll after a review.


* jk/commit-info-slab (2013-04-13) 3 commits
 - commit-slab: introduce a macro to define a slab for new type
 - commit-slab: avoid large realloc
 - commit: allow associating auxiliary info on-demand

 Technology demonstration to show a way we could use unbound number
 of flag bits on commit objects.


* jn/config-ignore-inaccessible (2013-04-15) 1 commit
 - config: allow inaccessible configuration under $HOME

 When $HOME is misconfigured to point at an unreadable directory, we
 used to complain and die. This loosens the check.

 I do not think we agreed that this is a good idea, though.

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* nd/pretty-formats (2013-04-17) 14 commits
 - pretty: support %>> that steal trailing spaces
 - pretty: support truncating in %>, %< and %><
 - pretty: support padding placeholders, %< %> and %><
 - SQUASH??? review comments (round #2)
 - pretty: add %C(auto) for auto-coloring

 - pretty: two phase conversion for non utf-8 commits
 - utf8.c: add reencode_string_len() that can handle NULs in string
 - utf8.c: add utf8_strnwidth() with the ability to skip ansi sequences
 - utf8.c: move display_mode_esc_sequence_len() for use by other functions
 - pretty: share code between format_decoration and show_decorations
 - pretty-formats.txt: wrap long lines
 - pretty: get the correct encoding for --pretty:format=%e
 - pretty: save commit encoding from logmsg_reencode if the caller needs it

 Looked sensible.

 Will merge to 'next' after waiting for further comments for a few days.

 - dir.c: git-status --ignored: don't list files in ignored directories
 - dir.c: git-status --ignored: don't drop ignored directories

 Rerolls kb/status-ignored-optim topic (reverted from 'next').
 With help from Karsten, conflicts with as/check-ignore topic have
 been sorted out and it is now in 'pu'.

 Will merge to 'next' after waiting for further comments for a few days.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* th/bisect-final-log (2013-04-15) 1 commit
 - bisect: Store first bad commit as comment in log file

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ap/strbuf-humanize (2013-04-10) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-14 at 66d7af5)
 + count-objects: add -H option to humanize sizes
 + strbuf: create strbuf_humanise_bytes() to show byte sizes

 Teach "--human-readable" aka "-H" option to "git count-objects" to
 show various large numbers in Ki/Mi/GiB scaled as necessary.

 I've decided to let this topic supersede mc/count-objects-kibibytes.
 Human users will get an even easier output with "-H" and by not
 changing the output without an explicit option we do not have to
 break third-party tools that may have been reading from the output
 of this command.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* as/clone-reference-with-gitfile (2013-04-09) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-15 at ab0d128)
 + clone: Allow repo using gitfile as a reference
 + clone: Fix error message for reference repository

 "git clone" did not work if a repository pointed at by the
 "--reference" option is a gitfile that points at another place.

 Will merge to 'master' after eyeballing it once again.


* fc/transport-helper-error-reporting (2013-04-17) 9 commits

 - doc/http-backend: match query-string in apache half-auth example
 - doc/http-backend: give some lighttpd config examples
 - doc/http-backend: clarify "half-auth" repo configuration

 Improve documentation to illustrate "push authenticated, fetch
 anonymous" configuration for smart HTTP servers.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 - submodule: drop the top-level requirement
 - rev-parse: add --prefix option

 Allow various subcommands of "git submodule" to be run not from the
 top of the working tree of the superproject.

 Worthy goal, but not quite there yet.
 $gmane/221575


* mv/sequencer-pick-error-diag (2013-04-11) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-16 at a2da926)

 "git cherry-pick $blob $tree" is diagnosed as a nonsense.

 Will merge to 'master' with the 'tr/copy-revisions-from-stdin' topic.

* jl/submodule-mv (2013-04-11) 4 commits
 - rm: delete .gitmodules entry of submodules removed from the work tree
 - Teach mv to update the path entry in .gitmodules for moved submodules
 - Teach mv to move submodules using a gitfile
 - Teach mv to move submodules together with their work trees

 "git mv A B" when moving a submodule A does "the right thing",
 inclusing relocating its working tree and adjusting the paths in
 the .gitmodules file.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jn/add-2.0-u-A-sans-pathspec (2013-04-03) 6 commits
 - git add: -u/-A now affects the entire working tree
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-05 at eae93ef)
 + add -A: only show pathless 'add -A' warning when changes exist outside cwd
 + add -u: only show pathless 'add -u' warning when changes exist outside cwd
 + add: make warn_pathless_add() a no-op after first call
 + add: add a blank line at the end of pathless 'add [-u|-A]' warning
 + add: make pathless 'add [-u|-A]' warning a file-global function

 "git add -u/-A" without any pathspec traditionally limited its
 operation to the current directory when run from a subdirectory,
 but in Git 2.0, they will affect the entire working tree.  Start
 training users to explicitly say "." or ":/" to smooth out the
 transition hump with the earlier parts of this series, and flip the
 default as the final step.

 Will merge to 'master' the early bits and cook the rest in 'next' until Git 2.0.


* nd/magic-pathspecs (2013-03-31) 45 commits
 . Rename field "raw" to "_raw" in struct pathspec
 . pathspec: support :(glob) syntax
 . pathspec: make --literal-pathspecs disable pathspec magic

 . parse_pathspec: support stripping submodule trailing slashes
 . parse_pathspec: a special flag for max_depth feature
 . Convert some get_pathspec() calls to parse_pathspec()
 . parse_pathspec: add PATHSPEC_PREFER_{CWD,FULL}
 . parse_pathspec: save original pathspec for reporting
 . Add parse_pathspec() that converts cmdline args to struct pathspec

 . pathspec: i18n-ize error strings in pathspec parsing code
 . Move struct pathspec and related functions to pathspec.[ch]
 . clean: remove unused variable "seen"
 . setup.c: check that the pathspec magic ends with ")"

 Migrate the rest of codebase to use "struct pathspec" more.

 Will be rerolled.


* jc/add-2.0-delete-default (2013-04-17) 4 commits
 - git add <pathspec>... defaults to "-A"
 - git add: rework the logic to warn "git add <pathspec>..." default change
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-05 at 199442e)
 + git add: start preparing for "git add <pathspec>..." to default to "-A"
 + builtin/add.c: simplify boolean variables

 In Git 2.0, "git add pathspec" will mean "git add -A pathspec".  If
 you did this in a working tree that tracks dir/lost and dir/another:

 $ rm dir/lost
 $ edit dir/another
 $ git add dir

 The last step will not only notices and records updated
 dir/another, but also notices and records the removal of dir/lost
 in the index.

 Start training the users for this change to say --no-all when they
 want to ignore the removal to smooth the transition hump.

 Will merge to 'master' the early bits and cook the tip one in 'next' until Git 2.0.


* tr/line-log (2013-04-12) 11 commits

 + t4211: pass -M to 'git log -M -L...' test
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-05 at 5afb00c)
 + log -L: fix overlapping input ranges
 + log -L: check range set invariants when we look it up
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-01 at 5be920c)
 + Speed up log -L... -M
 + log -L: :pattern:file syntax to find by funcname
 + Implement line-history search (git log -L)
 + Export rewrite_parents() for 'log -L'
 + Refactor parse_loc


* jc/push-2.0-default-to-simple (2013-04-03) 1 commit
 - push: switch default from "matching" to "simple"

 The early bits to adjust the tests have been merged to 'master'.

 Will cook in 'next' until Git 2.0.
