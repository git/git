Subject: What's cooking in git.git (Jun 2020, #06; Mon, 29)
X-master-at: a08a83db2bf27f015bec9a435f6d73e223c21c5e

What's cooking in git.git (Jun 2020, #06; Mon, 29)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'seen' (formerly 'pu'---proposed updates) while commits prefixed
with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

More topics graduate to the 'master' and to the 'next' branches.  I
expect that this week would be slower than usual due to US holidays
but hopefully we'd be able to merge most of the impactful topics by
the -rc0.  Some large-ish topics may have to be left for the next
cycle, as usual.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches of the
repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* dl/diff-usage-comment-update (2020-06-23) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-06-23 at 48d685cd45)
 + builtin/diff: fix botched update of usage comment
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-06-19 at b53a12bb66)
 + builtin/diff: update usage comment

 An in-code comment in "git diff" has been updated.


* rs/commit-reach-leakfix (2020-06-19) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-06-22 at fcc1e385f0)
 + commit-reach: plug minor memory leak after using is_descendant_of()

 Leakfix.


* rs/pull-leakfix (2020-06-19) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-06-22 at d80a6b9ca3)
 + pull: plug minor memory leak after using is_descendant_of()

 Leakfix.


* rs/retire-strbuf-write-fd (2020-06-19) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-06-22 at c175b54f2a)
 + strbuf: remove unreferenced strbuf_write_fd method.
 + bugreport.c: replace strbuf_write_fd with write_in_full

 A misdesigned strbuf_write_fd() function has been retired.


* sk/diff-files-show-i-t-a-as-new (2020-06-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-06-22 at 825a823416)
 + diff-files: treat "i-t-a" files as "not-in-index"
 (this branch is used by js/diff-files-i-t-a-fix-for-difftool.)

 "git diff-files" has been taught to say paths that are marked as
 intent-to-add are new files, not modified from an empty blob.


* xl/upgrade-repo-format (2020-06-05) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-06-19 at 02bf7a9d8c)
 + check_repository_format_gently(): refuse extensions for old repositories
 + sparse-checkout: upgrade repository to version 1 when enabling extension
 + fetch: allow adding a filter after initial clone
 + repository: add a helper function to perform repository format upgrade

 Allow runtime upgrade of the repository format version, which needs
 to be done carefully.

 There is a rather unpleasant backward compatibility worry with the
 last step of this series, but it is the right thing to do in the
 longer term.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* mt/hash-to-hex-thread-safety (2020-06-26) 2 commits
 - hex: make hash_to_hex_algop() and friends thread-safe
 - compat/win32/pthread: add pthread_once()

 hash_to_hex() used a set of rotating static buffers, which was not
 safe to use in a threaded environment.  This has been made safer by
 using thread-local storage.

 Will merge to 'next'.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* dr/push-remoteref-fix (2020-04-23) 1 commit
 - remote.c: fix handling of %(push:remoteref)

 The "%(push:remoteref)" placeholder in the "--format=" argument of
 "git format-patch" (and friends) only showed what got explicitly
 configured, not what ref at the receiving end would be updated when
 "git push" was used, as it ignored the default behaviour (e.g. update
 the same ref as the source).

 Expecting a reroll.
 cf. <20200416152145.wp2zeibxmuyas6y6@feanor>


* mr/bisect-in-c-2 (2020-04-23) 12 commits

 Rewrite of the remainder of "git bisect" script in C continues.

 Expecting a response to reviews.
 cf. <nycvar.QRO.7.76.6.2005230007260.56@tvgsbejvaqbjf.bet>


* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2018-10-15) 1 commit
 - zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* bc/http-push-flagsfix (2020-06-23) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-06-25 at 1dabb1f61b)
 + http-push: ensure unforced pushes fail when data would be lost

 The code to push changes over "dumb" HTTP had a bad interaction
 with the commit reachability code due to incorrect allocation of
 object flag bits, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 + fast-export: store anonymized oids as hex strings
 + fast-export: use xmemdupz() for anonymizing oids
 + t9351: derive anonymized tree checks from original repo

 "git fast-export --anonymize" learned to take customized mapping to
 allow its users to tweak its output more usable for debugging.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* js/diff-files-i-t-a-fix-for-difftool (2020-06-25) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-06-29 at a9fcdabb3b)
 + difftool -d: ensure that intent-to-add files are handled correctly
 + diff-files --raw: show correct post-image of intent-to-add files

 "git difftool" has trouble dealing with paths added to the index
 with the intent-to-add bit.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* js/pu-to-seen (2020-06-25) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-06-25 at 06c9e5a885)
 + tests: reference `seen` wherever `pu` was referenced
 + docs: adjust the technical overview for the rename `pu` -> `seen`

  (merged to 'next' on 2020-06-25 at 81a3aca46b)
 + doc: fix author vs. committer copy/paste error

 Docfix.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* mf/submodule-summary-with-correct-repository (2020-06-24) 2 commits
 - submodule: use submodule repository when preparing summary
 - revision: use repository from rev_info when parsing commits

 "git diff/show" on a change that involves a submodule used to read
 the information on commits in the submodule from a wrong repository
 and gave a wrong information when the commit-graph is involved.

 Needs tests.


* rs/pack-bits-in-object-better (2020-06-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-06-25 at b3cb296341)
 + revision: reallocate TOPO_WALK object flags

 By renumbering object flag bits, "struct object" managed to lose
 bloated inter-field padding.

 Will merge to 'master'.

  (merged to 'next' on 2020-06-29 at 91ffd85a31)
 + worktree: avoid dead-code in conditional

 Code cleanup.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 - send-email: restore --in-reply-to superseding behavior

 "git send-email --in-reply-to=<msg>" did not use the In-Reply-To:
 header with the value given from the command line, and let it be
 overridden by the value on In-Reply-To: header in the messages
 being sent out (if exists).

 Expecting a reroll/redesign.
 Does not behave sensibly for a multi-patch series.


* en/sparse-status (2020-06-22) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-06-25 at 404403a075)

 + bash-completion: add git-prune into bash completion

 Add "git prune" to the completion (in contrib/), which could be
 typed by end-users from the command line.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* js/default-branch-name (2020-06-24) 9 commits

 . ci: respect the [skip ci] convention in our GitHub workflow "CI/PR"

 Allow contributors to mark a branch/push that it does not have to
 be built via GitHub actions, in a way similar to how Travis lets
 them mark the commits with an embedded "[skip ci]" string.

 Superseded by dd/ci-only-on-selective-branches topic.


* dd/ci-only-on-selective-branches (2020-05-05) 2 commits
 - CI: limit GitHub Actions to designated branches
 - SubmittingPatches: advertise GitHub Actions CI

 Instead of always building all branches of all forks of our project
 at GitHub via GitHub Actions, only build when branches with known
 and specific names are updated, and also a pull request.
