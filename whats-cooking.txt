What's cooking in git.git (Jun 2009, #02; Thu, 18)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones
marked with '.' do not appear in any of the branches, but I am still
holding onto them.

The topics list the commits in reverse chronological order.  The topics
meant to be merged to the maintenance series have "maint-" in their names.

Unfortunately I am unusually short of time these days, and some of the
topics unfortunately got less "final review before deciding to merge up"
than I would have liked to give them.  This message itself has more
"please comment/review" requests than usual.

* ak/maint-for-each-ref-no-lookup (Wed May 27 15:23:12 2009 -0400) 1 commit
 + for-each-ref: Do not lookup objects when they will not be used

I think this makes sense, except that I have this nagging feeling that its
use of for_each_rawref() where the original used for_each_ref() may have
some unintended side effects in corner cases.

* da/araxis-mergetool (Sun May 24 00:24:41 2009 +0000) 1 commit

 + bisect: add parameters to "filter_skipped"

Regardless of metrics, this is an improvement from the current one.  Will
merge to 'master', and let the finer details taken care of later, which
is already happening.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Will merge to "master" soon]

* ph/submodule-rebase (Wed Jun 3 00:59:12 2009 +0200) 1 commit
 + git-submodule: add support for --merge.

Even though some might still argue that "update --merge" is not a good
mode of operation.

* jc/cache-tree (Fri May 22 23:14:25 2009 -0700) 5 commits
 + Avoid "diff-index --cached" optimization under --find-copies-
   harder
 + Optimize "diff-index --cached" using cache-tree
 + t4007: modernize the style
 + cache-tree.c::cache_tree_find(): simplify internal API
 + write-tree --ignore-cache-tree

* mn/maint-iconv-autoconf (Mon Jun 8 20:46:38 2009 -0700) 1 commit
 + fix handling of iconv configuration options

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Stalled and may need help and prodding to go forward]

* jh/notes (Sat May 16 13:44:17 2009 +0200) 5 commits
 - Teach "-m <msg>" and "-F <file>" to "git notes edit"
 - Add an expensive test for git-notes
 - Speed up git notes lookup
 - Add a script to edit/inspect notes
 - Introduce commit notes

Dscho asked about the performance implications of this; I do not think I
saw any progress on that yet...

* lt/read-directory (Fri May 15 12:01:29 2009 -0700) 3 commits
 - Add initial support for pathname conversion to UTF-8
 - read_directory(): infrastructure for pathname character set
   conversion
 - Add 'fill_directory()' helper function for directory traversal

Before adding the real "conversion", this needs a few real fixups, I
think.  For example there is one hardcoded array that is used without
bounds check.

* ar/maint-1.6.2-merge-recursive-d-f (Mon May 11 21:25:36 2009 +0200) 2 commits
 - Fix for a merge where a branch has an F->D transition
 - Add a reminder test case for a merge with F/D transition

Although the reported breakage is covered with the patch, Alex feels the
solution unsatisfactory. Cleaning up D/F conflict handling in merge-recursive
may be long overdue but seems to be a hard problem.

* ps/blame (Thu Mar 12 21:30:03 2009 +1100) 1 commit
 - blame.c: start libifying the blame infrastructure

A few minor point remains in this initial one.

* jc/log-tz (Tue Mar 3 00:45:37 2009 -0800) 1 commit
 - Allow --date=local --date=other-format to work as expected

The one I posted had a few corner-case bugs that was caught with the test
suite; this one has them fixed.  People did not like the UI so it is kept
out of 'next'

* jc/merge-convert (Mon Jan 26 16:45:01 2009 -0800) 1 commit
 - git-merge-file: allow converting the results for the work tree

This is a feature waiting for a user.

We did not give scripted Porcelains a way to say "this temporary file I am
using for merging is for this path, so use the core.autocrlf and attributes
rules for that final path".  Instead, merge-file simply wrote out the
data in the canonical repository representation.

rerere has the same issue, but it is a lot worse.  It reads the three
files (preimage, postimage and thisimage) from the work tree in the work
tree representation, merges them without converting them to the canonical
representation first but inserts the conflict markers with the canonical
representation and writes the resulting mess out.  It needs to be fixed to
read with convert_to_git(), merge them while they are still in the
canonical representation and possibly add conflict markers, and then write
the results out after convert_to_working_tree().  It also needs to write
in binary mode as well.

* db/foreign-scm (Tue Mar 24 23:04:12 2009 -0400) 3 commits
 - Add option for using a foreign VCS
 - Document details of transport function APIs
 - Allow late reporting of fetched hashes

* hv/cvsps-tests (Sun Apr 5 01:40:50 2009 -0700) 8 commits
 - t/t9600: remove exit after test_done
 - cvsimport: extend testcase about patchset order to contain
   branches
 - cvsimport: add test illustrating a bug in cvsps
 - Add a test of "git cvsimport"'s handling of tags and branches
 - Add some tests of git-cvsimport's handling of vendor branches
 - Test contents of entire cvsimported "master" tree contents
 - Use CVS's -f option if available (ignore user's ~/.cvsrc file)
 - Start a library for cvsimport-related tests

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Actively cooking]

* tr/die_errno (Fri Jun 12 09:00:59 2009 -0700) 5 commits
 - DONTMERGE fix double per-cent
 - Use die_errno() instead of die() when checking syscalls
 - Convert existing die(..., strerror(errno)) to die_errno()
 - die_errno(): double % in strerror() output just in case
 - Introduce die_errno() that appends strerror(errno) to die()

I didn't check the individual conversion from die() to die_errno()
in this latest round; comments?

Thomas found issues in my "double per-cent hack", so this cannot be merged
to yet until either it is fixed up, or drop the "double per-cent" attempt
altogether.

* sb/pull-rebase (Fri Jun 12 00:39:21 2009 +0200) 3 commits
 + parse-remote: remove unused functions
 + parse-remote: support default reflist in get_remote_merge_branch
 + parse-remote: function to get the tracking branch to be merge

It would be nice if we can fix the "currently works only for the default
mapping" before it goes to 'master'.  I looked at, but haven't queued any
of the recent RFC updates here.

* ne/futz-upload-pack (Wed Jun 10 01:50:18 2009 +0200) 1 commit
 - Shift object enumeration out of upload-pack

* ml/http (Wed May 27 23:16:03 2009 -0400) 2 commits
 - http.c: add http.sslCertPasswordProtected option
 - http.c: prompt for SSL client certificate password

I've rewritten these two to (1) move the #ifdef out of the main codepath,
and (2) use configuration/environment to make the misfeature of always
asking for a passphrase even a key/cert is unencrypted optional.  I tried
to be careful but extra sets of eyeballs would be nice to check the result.

* mg/pushurl (Sun Jun 14 21:46:10 2009 +0200) 6 commits
 + avoid NULL dereference on failed malloc
 + builtin-remote: Make "remote -v" display push urls
 + builtin-remote: Show push urls as well
 + technical/api-remote: Describe new struct remote member pushurl
 + t5516: Check pushurl config setting
 + Allow push and fetch urls to be different

* cc/bisect (Sat Jun 13 13:11:02 2009 +0200) 2 commits
 - Documentation: remove warning saying that "git bisect skip" may
   slow bisection
 - bisect: use a PRNG with a bias when skipping away from untestable
   commits

Will be in 'next' shortly.

* gb/am-foreign (Wed May 27 11:25:19 2009 +0200) 4 commits
 - git-am: refactor 'cleaning up and aborting'
 - git-am foreign patch support: StGIT support
 - git-am foreign patch support: autodetect some patch formats
 - git-am foreign patch support: introduce patch_format

Will be in 'next' shortly.

* jc/diff-whitespace-only-status (Sat May 23 01:15:35 2009 -0700) 2 commits
 - diff: Rename QUIET internal option to QUICK
 - diff: change semantics of "ignore whitespace" options

I am not sure if it should wait for a major version bump but this is a
good semantics change.  Perhaps merge to 'next' soonish, but I am
undecided.  Comments?

* cc/replace (Wed May 27 07:14:09 2009 +0200) 14 commits
 - t6050: check pushing something based on a replaced commit
 - Documentation: add documentation for "git replace"
 - Add git-replace to .gitignore
 - builtin-replace: use "usage_msg_opt" to give better error messages
 - parse-options: add new function "usage_msg_opt"
 - builtin-replace: teach "git replace" to actually replace
 - Add new "git replace" command
 - environment: add global variable to disable replacement
 - mktag: call "check_sha1_signature" with the replacement sha1
 - replace_object: add a test case
 - object: call "check_sha1_signature" with the replacement sha1
 - sha1_file: add a "read_sha1_file_repl" function
 - replace_object: add mechanism to replace objects found in
   "refs/replace/"
 - refs: add a "for_each_replace_ref" function

----------------------------------------------------------------
[On Hold]

* jc/deny-delete-current-1.7.0 (Mon Feb 9 00:19:46 2009 -0800) 1 commit
 - receive-pack: default receive.denyDeleteCurrent to refuse

* jc/refuse-push-to-current-1.7.0 (Wed Feb 11 02:28:03 2009 -0800) 1 commit
 - Refuse updating the current branch in a non-bare repository via
   push

These are for 1.7.0, but the messages when they trigger together may need
to be rethought.
