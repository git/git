What's cooking in git.git (Aug 2020, #02; Mon, 10)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'seen' (formerly 'pu'---proposed updates) while commits prefixed
with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches of the
repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

* en/eol-attrs-gotchas (2020-08-03) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-05 at 46e73f4c94)
 + checkout: support renormalization with checkout -m <paths>
 + merge: make merge.renormalize work for all uses of merge machinery
 + t6038: remove problematic test
 + t6038: make tests fail for the right reason

 All "mergy" operations that internally use the merge-recursive
 machinery should honor the merge.renormalize configuration, but
 many of them didn't.


* en/merge-recursive-comment-fixes (2020-08-02) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-04 at ec14b8ea94)
 + merge-recursive: fix unclear and outright wrong comments

 Comment fix.

 Adjust tests in contrib/ to the recent change to fmt-merge-msg.


* es/worktree-cleanup (2020-07-31) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-04 at 798f642f66)
 + worktree: retire special-case normalization of main worktree path
 + worktree: drop bogus and unnecessary path munging
 + worktree: drop unused code from get_linked_worktree()
 + worktree: drop pointless strbuf_release()

 Code cleanup around "worktree" API implementation.


* jk/compiler-fixes-and-workarounds (2020-08-04) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-04 at a1caf8edbc)
 + revision: avoid leak when preparing bloom filter for "/"
 + revision: avoid out-of-bounds read/write on empty pathspec
 + config: work around gcc-10 -Wstringop-overflow warning

 Small fixes and workarounds.


* jk/strvec (2020-07-30) 11 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-04 at 61addb841f)
 + strvec: rename struct fields
 + strvec: drop argv_array compatibility layer
 + strvec: update documention to avoid argv_array
 + strvec: fix indentation in renamed calls
 + strvec: convert remaining callers away from argv_array name
 + strvec: convert more callers away from argv_array name
 + strvec: convert builtin/ callers away from argv_array name
 + quote: rename sq_dequote_to_argv_array to mention strvec
 + strvec: rename files from argv-array to strvec
 + argv-array: rename to strvec
 + argv-array: use size_t for count and alloc
 (this branch is used by ds/maintenance and ds/maintenance-part-2.)

 The argv_array API is useful for not just managing argv but any
 "vector" (NULL-terminated array) of strings, and has seen adoption
 to a certain degree.  It has been renamed to "strvec" to reduce the
 barrier to adoption.


* jt/pack-objects-prefetch-in-batch (2020-07-21) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-03 at 29424e614d)
 + pack-objects: prefetch objects to be packed
 + pack-objects: refactor to oid_object_info_extended

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2020-08-01

 While packing many objects in a repository with a promissor remote,
 lazily fetching missing objects from the promissor remote one by
 one may be inefficient---the code now attempts to fetch all the
 missing objects in batch (obviously this won't work for a lazy
 clone that lazily fetches tree objects as you cannot even enumerate
 what blobs are missing until you learn which trees are missing).


* jt/pretend-object-never-come-from-elsewhere (2020-07-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-03 at 36cd23aae5)
 + sha1-file: make pretend_object_file() not prefetch

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2020-08-01

 The pretend-object mechanism checks if the given object already
 exists in the object store before deciding to keep the data
 in-core, but the check would have triggered lazy fetching of such
 an object from a promissor remote.


* ma/t1450-quotefix (2020-08-01) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-04 at 0e762e3553)

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2020-08-01

 Command line completion (in contrib/) update.
 A follow-up patch to reduce duplication may be warranted.


* ny/notes-doc-sample-update (2020-08-03) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-04 at a63dcb2c55)

 + git-cvsexportcommit: support Perl before 5.10.1

 Portability fix.

 Will merge to 'master'.

* jt/has_object (2020-08-06) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-07 at ed08abb693)
 + fsck: do not lazy fetch known non-promisor object
 + pack-objects: no fetch when allow-{any,promisor}
 + apply: do not lazy fetch when applying binary
 + sha1-file: introduce no-lazy-fetch has_object()

 A new helper function has_object() has been introduced to make it
 easier to mark object existence checks that do and don't want to
 trigger lazy fetches, and a few such checks are converted using it.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ma/doc-sha-256-is-experimental (2020-08-06) 1 commit
 - Documentation: mark `--object-format=sha256` as experimental

 The recent addition of SHA-256 support is marked as experimental in
 the documentation.


* ma/test-quote-cleanup (2020-08-06) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-10 at 63a95c2926)

 + t: don't spuriously close and reopen quotes

 Test cleanup.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* rp/apply-cached-with-i-t-a (2020-08-09) 3 commits
 - t4140: test apply with i-t-a paths
 - apply: make i-t-a entries never match worktree
 - apply: allow "new file" patches on i-t-a entries

 Recent versions of "git diff-files" shows a diff between the index
 and the working tree for "intent-to-add" paths as a "new file"
 patch; "git apply --cached" should be able to take "git diff-files"
 and should act as an equivalent to "git add" for the path, but the
 command failed to do so for such a path.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* rp/blame-first-parent-doc (2020-08-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-10 at 3fdbebe1ea)

 The "git blame --first-parent" option was not documented, but now
 it is.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/noop-withstatic-inline (2020-08-06) 1 commit
 - compat-util: type-check parameters of no-op replacement functions

 A no-op replacement function implemented as a C preprocessor macro
 does not perform as good a job as one implemented as a "static
 inline" function in catching errors in parameters; replace the
 former with the latter in <git-compat-util.h> header.


* ps/ref-transaction-hook (2020-08-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-10 at d8ad7cc8f6)
 + refs: fix interleaving hook calls with reference-transaction hook

 The logic to find the ref transaction hook script attempted to
 cache the path to the found hook without realizing that it needed
 to keep a copied value, as the API it used returned a transitory
 buffer space.  This has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.
 to be followed by a removal of the caching feature, which does not
 seem to help even as a negative cache.


* ss/submodule-summary-in-c (2020-08-06) 5 commits

 - ci: fix inconsistent indentation


* es/init-no-separate-git-dir-in-bare (2020-08-10) 1 commit
 - init: disallow --separate-git-dir with bare repository

 "git init --separate-git-dir" can be used in an existing repository
 with a working tree to move its .git/ directory away from the
 working tree.  Even though this re-init feature makes no sense in
 an existing bare repository, it was not erroring out.  Now it does.


* es/test-cmp-typocatcher (2020-08-09) 1 commit

* rp/ita-diff-modefix (2020-08-09) 1 commit
 - diff-lib: use worktree mode in diffs from i-t-a entries

 "git diff [<tree-ish>] $path" for a $path that is marked with i-t-a
 bit was not showing the mode bits from the working tree.

 - rebase -i: support --ignore-date
 - sequencer: rename amend_author to author_to_free

 - t/helper/test-config: return exit codes consistently
 - doc: grep: unify info on configuration variables

 "git grep" has been tweaked to be limited to the sparse checkout
 paths.

 Review needed on 4/6; otherwise looking sane.

 Expecting a reroll.


* ls/mergetool-meld-auto-merge (2020-07-12) 2 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - Support auto-merge for meld to follow the vim-diff behavior

 The 'meld' backend of the "git mergetool" learned to give the
 underlying 'meld' the '--auto-merge' option, which would help
 reduce the amount of text that requires manual merging.

 Expecting a reroll.


* jx/proc-receive-hook (2020-05-18) 11 commits
 . doc: add documentation for the proc-receive hook
 . transport: parse report options for tracking refs

 . receive-pack: new config receive.procReceiveRefs
 . refs.c: refactor to reuse ref_is_hidden()

 . New capability "report-status-v2" for git-push
 . receive-pack: add new proc-receive hook
 . t5411: add basic test cases for proc-receive hook
 . transport: not report a non-head push as a branch

 "git receive-pack" that accepts requests by "git push" learned to
 outsource most of the ref updates to the new "proc-receive" hook.

 Ejected out of 'seen'; somehow its tests seem to break with clang
 cf. https://travis-ci.org/github/git/git/builds/713443572


* mf/submodule-summary-with-correct-repository (2020-06-24) 2 commits
 - submodule: use submodule repository when preparing summary
 - revision: use repository from rev_info when parsing commits

 "git diff/show" on a change that involves a submodule used to read
 the information on commits in the submodule from a wrong repository
 and gave a wrong information when the commit-graph is involved.

 Needs tests.


* dr/push-remoteref-fix (2020-04-23) 1 commit
 - remote.c: fix handling of %(push:remoteref)

 The "%(push:remoteref)" placeholder in the "--format=" argument of
 "git format-patch" (and friends) only showed what got explicitly
 configured, not what ref at the receiving end would be updated when
 "git push" was used, as it ignored the default behaviour (e.g. update
 the same ref as the source).

 Expecting a reroll.

* mr/bisect-in-c-2 (2020-07-17) 14 commits

 . bisect--helper: reimplement `bisect_autostart` shell function in C
 . bisect--helper: introduce new `write_in_file()` function
 . bisect--helper: use '-res' in 'cmd_bisect__helper' return
 . bisect--helper: BUG() in cmd_*() on invalid subcommand

 Rewrite of the remainder of "git bisect" script in C continues.

 Needs more work.
 Ejected out of 'seen'; al/bisect-first-parent topic has a bit of
 textual conflict with this topic.


* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2018-10-15) 1 commit

 + revision: add "--no-diff-merges" option to counteract "-m"
 + log: drop "--cc implies -m" logic

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2020-08-01

 "git log --first-parent -p" showed patches only for single-parent
 commits on the first-parent chain; the "--first-parent" option has
 been made to imply "-m".  Use "--no-diff-merges" to restore the
 previous behaviour to omit patches for merge commits.
