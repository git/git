What's cooking in git.git (Jan 2017, #03; Thu, 19)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

The sixth batch of topics have been merged to 'master'.  This batch
is fairly large, and regression-hunting is very much appreciated.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

[Graduated to "master"]

* bw/grep-recurse-submodules (2016-12-22) 12 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-12-22 at 1ede815b8d)
 + grep: search history of moved submodules
 + grep: enable recurse-submodules to work on <tree> objects
 + grep: optionally recurse into submodules
 + grep: add submodules as a grep source type
 + submodules: load gitmodules file from commit sha1
 + submodules: add helper to determine if a submodule is initialized
 + submodules: add helper to determine if a submodule is populated
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-12-22 at fea8fa870f)
 + real_path: canonicalize directory separators in root parts
 + real_path: have callers use real_pathdup and strbuf_realpath
 + real_path: create real_pathdup
 + real_path: convert real_path_internal to strbuf_realpath
 + real_path: resolve symlinks by hand
 (this branch is tangled with bw/realpath-wo-chdir.)

 "git grep" has been taught to optionally recurse into submodules.


* bw/pathspec-cleanup (2017-01-08) 16 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-01-10 at 79291ff506)
 + pathspec: rename prefix_pathspec to init_pathspec_item
 + pathspec: small readability changes
 + pathspec: create strip submodule slash helpers
 + pathspec: create parse_element_magic helper
 + pathspec: create parse_long_magic function
 + pathspec: create parse_short_magic function
 + pathspec: factor global magic into its own function
 + pathspec: simpler logic to prefix original pathspec elements
 + pathspec: always show mnemonic and name in unsupported_magic
 + pathspec: remove unused variable from unsupported_magic
 + pathspec: copy and free owned memory
 + pathspec: remove the deprecated get_pathspec function
 + ls-tree: convert show_recursive to use the pathspec struct interface
 + dir: convert fill_directory to use the pathspec struct interface
 + dir: remove struct path_simplify
 + mv: remove use of deprecated 'get_pathspec()'
 (this branch is used by sb/pathspec-errors.)

 Code clean-up in the pathspec API.


* bw/realpath-wo-chdir (2017-01-09) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-01-10 at ed315a40c8)
 + real_path: set errno when max number of symlinks is exceeded
 + real_path: prevent redefinition of MAXSYMLINKS
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-12-22 at fea8fa870f)
 + real_path: canonicalize directory separators in root parts
 + real_path: have callers use real_pathdup and strbuf_realpath
 + real_path: create real_pathdup
 + real_path: convert real_path_internal to strbuf_realpath
 + real_path: resolve symlinks by hand
 (this branch is tangled with bw/grep-recurse-submodules.)

 The implementation of "real_path()" was to go there with chdir(2)
 and call getcwd(3), but this obviously wouldn't be usable in a
 threaded environment.  Rewrite it to manually resolve relative
 paths including symbolic links in path components.


* dt/disable-bitmap-in-auto-gc (2016-12-29) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-01-10 at 9f4e89e15d)
 + repack: die on incremental + write-bitmap-index
 + auto gc: don't write bitmaps for incremental repacks

 It is natural that "git gc --auto" may not attempt to pack
 everything into a single pack, and there is no point in warning
 when the user has configured the system to use the pack bitmap,
 leading to disabling further "gc".


* jk/archive-zip-userdiff-config (2017-01-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-01-10 at ac42e4958c)
 + archive-zip: load userdiff config

 "git archive" did not read the standard configuration files, and
 failed to notice a file that is marked as binary via the userdiff
 driver configuration.


* jk/blame-fixes (2017-01-07) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-01-10 at 18f909da61)
 + blame: output porcelain "previous" header for each file
 + blame: handle --no-abbrev
 + blame: fix alignment with --abbrev=40

 "git blame --porcelain" misidentified the "previous" <commit, path>
 pair (aka "source") when contents came from two or more files.


* jk/execv-dashed-external (2017-01-09) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-01-10 at 117b506cb0)
 + execv_dashed_external: wait for child on signal death
 + execv_dashed_external: stop exiting with negative code
 + execv_dashed_external: use child_process struct

 Typing ^C to pager, which usually does not kill it, killed Git and
 took the pager down as a collateral damage in certain process-tree
 structure.  This has been fixed.


* jk/rebase-i-squash-count-fix (2017-01-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-01-10 at d6cfc6ace2)
 + rebase--interactive: count squash commits above 10 correctly

 "git rebase -i" with a recent update started showing an incorrect
 count when squashing more than 10 commits.


* js/asciidoctor-tweaks (2017-01-13) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-01-15 at 8553c6e513)
 + asciidoctor: fix user-manual to be built by `asciidoctor`
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-01-10 at 087da7b7c1)
 + giteveryday: unbreak rendering with AsciiDoctor

 Adjust documentation to help AsciiDoctor render better while not
 breaking the rendering done by AsciiDoc.


* js/mingw-test-push-unc-path (2017-01-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-01-10 at 249d9f26f3)
 + mingw: add a regression test for pushing to UNC paths

 "git push \\server\share\dir" has recently regressed and then
 fixed.  A test has retroactively been added for this breakage.


* km/branch-get-push-while-detached (2017-01-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-01-10 at a7f8af8c55)
 + branch_get_push: do not segfault when HEAD is detached

 "git <cmd> @{push}" on a detached HEAD used to segfault; it has
 been corrected to error out with a message.


* ls/p4-retry-thrice (2016-12-29) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-01-10 at c733e27410)
 + git-p4: do not pass '-r 0' to p4 commands

 A recent updates to "git p4" was not usable for older p4 but it
 could be made to work with minimum changes.  Do so.


* pb/test-must-fail-is-for-git (2017-01-09) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-01-10 at 5f24a98779)
 + t9813: avoid using pipes
 + don't use test_must_fail with grep

 Test cleanup.


* rh/mergetool-regression-fix (2017-01-10) 14 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-01-10 at e8e00c798b)
 + mergetool: fix running in subdir when rerere enabled
 + mergetool: take the "-O" out of $orderfile
 + t7610: add test case for rerere+mergetool+subdir bug
 + t7610: spell 'git reset --hard' consistently
 + t7610: don't assume the checked-out commit
 + t7610: always work on a test-specific branch
 + t7610: delete some now-unnecessary 'git reset --hard' lines
 + t7610: run 'git reset --hard' after each test to clean up
 + t7610: don't rely on state from previous test
 + t7610: use test_when_finished for cleanup tasks
 + t7610: move setup code to the 'setup' test case
 + t7610: update branch names to match test number
 + rev-parse doc: pass "--" to rev-parse in the --prefix example
 + .mailmap: record canonical email for Richard Hansen

 "git mergetool" without any pathspec on the command line that is
 run from a subdirectory became no-op in Git v2.11 by mistake, which
 has been fixed.


* sb/pathspec-errors (2017-01-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-01-10 at 432375cb62)
 + pathspec: give better message for submodule related pathspec error
 (this branch uses bw/pathspec-cleanup.)

 Running "git add a/b" when "a" is a submodule correctly errored
 out, but without a meaningful error message.


* sb/remove-gitview (2017-01-13) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-01-15 at 7c9eae479e)
 + doc: git-gui browser does not default to HEAD
 + doc: gitk: add the upstream repo location
 + doc: gitk: remove gitview reference
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-01-10 at dcb3abd146)
 + contrib: remove gitview

 Retire long unused/unmaintained gitview from the contrib/ area.


* sb/submodule-cleanup-export-git-dir-env (2017-01-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-01-10 at 2d5db6821e)
 + submodule.c: use GIT_DIR_ENVIRONMENT consistently

 Code cleanup.


* sb/submodule-rm-absorb (2016-12-27) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-01-10 at 1fc2000a92)
 + rm: absorb a submodules git dir before deletion
 + submodule: rename and add flags to ok_to_remove_submodule
 + submodule: modernize ok_to_remove_submodule to use argv_array
 + submodule.h: add extern keyword to functions

 "git rm" used to refuse to remove a submodule when it has its own
 git repository embedded in its working tree.  It learned to move
 the repository away to $GIT_DIR/modules/ of the superproject
 instead, and allow the submodule to be deleted (as long as there
 will be no loss of local modifications, that is).


* sb/unpack-trees-cleanup (2017-01-10) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-01-10 at 95a5f3127c)
 + unpack-trees: factor progress setup out of check_updates
 + unpack-trees: remove unneeded continue
 + unpack-trees: move checkout state into check_updates

 Code cleanup.


* sp/cygwin-build-fixes (2017-01-09) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-01-10 at 2010fb6c03)
 + Makefile: put LIBS after LDFLAGS for imap-send
 + Makefile: POSIX windres

 Build updates for Cygwin.

 - mingw: follow-up to "replace isatty() hack"

 An update to a topic that is already in 'master'.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 - sequencer (rebase -i): write out the final message
 - sequencer (rebase -i): write the progress into files
 - sequencer (rebase -i): show the progress

 - sequencer (rebase -i): record interrupted commits in rewritten, too
 - sequencer (rebase -i): copy commit notes at end
 - sequencer (rebase -i): set the reflog message consistently
 - sequencer (rebase -i): refactor setting the reflog message
 - sequencer (rebase -i): allow fast-forwarding for edit/reword
 - sequencer (rebase -i): implement the 'reword' command

 set of patches can start using it to reimplement "rebase -i".

 I think I've said everything that needs to be said on this topic;
 will wait for a few days and merge it to 'next', perhaps early next
 week.


* jk/clear-delta-base-cache-fix (2017-01-19) 1 commit
 - clear_delta_base_cache(): don't modify hashmap while iterating

 A crashing bug introduced in v2.11 timeframe has been found (it is
 triggerable only in fast-import) and fixed.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/describe-omit-some-refs (2017-01-19) 6 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - describe: teach describe negative pattern matches
 - describe: teach --match to accept multiple patterns
 - name-rev: add support to exclude refs by pattern match
 - name-rev: extend --refs to accept multiple patterns
 - doc: add documentation for OPT_STRING_LIST

 "git describe" and "git name-rev" have been taught to take more
 than one refname patterns to restrict the set of refs to base their
 naming output on, and also learned to take negative patterns to
 name refs not to be used for naming via their "--exclude" option.

 Will merge to 'next' after making sure SQUASH??? is correctly
 squashed in.


* js/remote-rename-with-half-configured-remote (2017-01-19) 2 commits
 - remote rename: more carefully determine whether a remote is configured
 - remote rename: demonstrate a bogus "remote exists" bug

 With anticipatory tweaking for remotes defined in ~/.gitconfig
 (e.g. "remote.origin.prune" set to true, even though there may or
 may not actually be "origin" remote defined in a particular Git
 repository), "git remote rename" and other commands misinterpreted
 and behaved as if such a non-existing remote actually existed.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sb/in-core-index-doc (2017-01-19) 4 commits
 - documentation: retire unfinished documentation
 - cache.h: document add_[file_]to_index
 - cache.h: document remove_index_entry_at
 - cache.h: document index_name_pos

 Documentation and in-code comments updates.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sb/retire-convert-objects-from-contrib (2017-01-19) 1 commit
 - contrib: remove git-convert-objects

 Remove an ancient tool left in contrib/.

 Will merge to 'next'.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* jc/diff-b-m (2015-02-23) 5 commits
 . WIPWIP
 . WIP: diff-b-m
 - diffcore-rename: allow easier debugging
 - diffcore-rename.c: add locate_rename_src()
 - diffcore-break: allow debugging

 "git diff -B -M" produced incorrect patch when the postimage of a
 completely rewritten file is similar to the preimage of a removed
 file; such a resulting file must not be expressed as a rename from
 other place.

 The fix in this patch is broken, unfortunately.

 Will discard.

--------------------------------------------------

* bw/read-blob-data-does-not-modify-index-state (2017-01-11) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-01-18 at f33363fb07)
 + index: improve constness for reading blob data

 Code clean-up.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ep/commit-static-buf-cleanup (2017-01-13) 2 commits
 - builtin/commit.c: switch to xstrfmt(), instead of snprintf()
 - builtin/commit.c: remove the PATH_MAX limitation via dynamic allocation

 Code clean-up.

 Expecting a reroll.
 The tip one would instead be done with strbuf.

* jk/grep-e-could-be-extended-beyond-posix (2017-01-11) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-01-18 at dd1b9d1fa8)
 + t7810: avoid assumption about invalid regex syntax

 Tighten a test to avoid mistaking an extended ERE regexp engine as
 a PRE regexp engine.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/vreport-sanitize (2017-01-11) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-01-18 at 4bbf370981)
 + vreport: sanitize ASCII control chars
 + Revert "vreportf: avoid intermediate buffer"

 An error message with an ASCII control character like '\r' in it
 can alter the message to hide its early part, which is problematic
 when a remote side gives such an error message that the local side
 will relay with a "remote: " prefix.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* sb/unpack-trees-super-prefix (2017-01-12) 5 commits
 - SQUASH
 - unpack-trees: support super-prefix option
 - t1001: modernize style
 - t1000: modernize style
 - read-tree: use OPT_BOOL instead of OPT_SET_INT

 "git read-tree" and its underlying unpack_trees() machinery learned
 to report problematic paths prefixed with the --super-prefix option.

 Expecting a reroll.
 The first three are in good shape.  The last one needs a better
 explanation and possibly an update to its test.

 "git diff" learned diff.interHunkContext configuration variable
 that gives the default value for its --inter-hunk-context option.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 Test clean-up.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* vn/xdiff-func-context (2017-01-15) 1 commit
 - xdiff -W: relax end-of-file function detection

 "git diff -W" has been taught to handle the case where a new
 function is added at the end of the file better.

 Will hold.
 An follow-up change to go back from the line that matches the
 funcline to show comments before the function definition is still
 being discussed.

 - worktree move: refuse to move worktrees with submodules
 - worktree move: accept destination as directory

 "git worktree" learned move and remove subcommands.

 Needs review.


* nd/log-graph-configurable-colors (2017-01-19) 4 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - log --graph: customize the graph lines with config log.graphColors
 - color.c: trim leading spaces in color_parse_mem()
 - color.c: fix color_parse_mem() with value_len == 0

 Some people feel the default set of colors used by "git log --graph"
 rather limiting.  A mechanism to customize the set of colors has
 been introduced.

 Will merge to 'next' after making sure SQUASH??? is correctly
 squashed in.

 - push: add option to push only submodules
 - submodules: add RECURSE_SUBMODULES_ONLY value

 "git submodule push" learned "--recurse-submodules=only option to
 push submodules out without pushing the top-level superproject.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ls/p4-path-encoding (2016-12-18) 1 commit
 - git-p4: fix git-p4.pathEncoding for removed files

 When "git p4" imports changelist that removes paths, it failed to
 convert pathnames when the p4 used encoding different from the one
 used on the Git side.  This has been corrected.

 Will be rerolled.

 Turn the default of "push.recurseSubmodules" to "check" when
 submodules seem to be in use.

 Will cook in 'next'.

 + setup_git_env: avoid blind fall-back to ".git"

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2016-10-26

 This is the endgame of the topic to avoid blindly falling back to
 ".git" when the setup sequence said we are _not_ in Git repository.
 A corner case that happens to work right now may be broken by a
 call to die("BUG").

 Will cook in 'next'.

* sg/fix-versioncmp-with-common-suffix (2017-01-12) 8 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-01-18 at f79c24a291)
 + versioncmp: generalize version sort suffix reordering
 + versioncmp: factor out helper for suffix matching
 + versioncmp: use earliest-longest contained suffix to determine sorting order
 + versioncmp: cope with common part overlapping with prerelease suffix
 + versioncmp: pass full tagnames to swap_prereleases()
 + t7004-tag: add version sort tests to show prerelease reordering issues
 + t7004-tag: use test_config helper
 + t7004-tag: delete unnecessary tags with test_when_finished

 The prereleaseSuffix feature of version comparison that is used in
 "git tag -l" did not correctly when two or more prereleases for the
 same release were present (e.g. when 2.0, 2.0-beta1, and 2.0-beta2
 are there and the code needs to compare 2.0-beta1 and 2.0-beta2).

 Will merge to 'master'.

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2016-10-11

 Stop supporting "git merge <message> HEAD <commit>" syntax that has
 been deprecated since October 2007, and issues a deprecation
 warning message since v2.5.0.

* jc/bundle (2016-03-03) 6 commits
 . index-pack: --clone-bundle option
 . Merge branch 'jc/index-pack' into jc/bundle
 . bundle v3: the beginning
 . bundle: keep a copy of bundle file name in the in-core bundle header
 . bundle: plug resource leak
 . bundle doc: 'verify' is not about verifying the bundle

 The beginning of "split bundle", which could be one of the
 ingredients to allow "git clone" traffic off of the core server
 network to CDN.

 While I think it would make it easier for people to experiment and
 build on if the topic is merged to 'next', I am at the same time a
 bit reluctant to merge an unproven new topic that introduces a new
 file format, which we may end up having to support til the end of
 time.  It is likely that to support a "prime clone from CDN", it
 would need a lot more than just "these are the heads and the pack
 data is over there", so this may not be sufficient.


* jk/nofollow-attr-ignore (2016-11-02) 5 commits
 . exclude: do not respect symlinks for in-tree .gitignore
 . attr: do not respect symlinks for in-tree .gitattributes
 . exclude: convert "check_index" into a flags field
 . attr: convert "macro_ok" into a flags field
 . add open_nofollow() helper

 As we do not follow symbolic links when reading control files like
 .gitignore and .gitattributes from the index, match the behaviour
 and not follow symbolic links when reading them from the working
 tree.  This also tightens security a bit by not leaking contents of
 an unrelated file in the error messages when it is pointed at by
 one of these files that is a symbolic link.

 Perhaps we want to cover .gitmodules too with the same mechanism?
