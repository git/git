What's cooking in git.git (Aug 2010, #01; Wed, 4)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones
marked with '.' do not appear in any of the integration branches, but I am
still holding onto them.

The tip of 'next' has been rewound and rebuilt on top of v1.7.2; also a
few topics have been ejected as I've been warning to.  I'll start merging
more stuff to 'next' in the next round after reading them over again.
