What's cooking in git.git (Sep 2012, #06; Mon, 17)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.

The seventh wave of topics are in 'master' now.

The archive-zip topic really needs help by people on platforms where
zip archive is an important part of life (in other words, not UNIX)
to test, in order to make sure the archive generated out of a tree
with non-ascii filenames are usable on their platforms.

I'm planning to keep this cycle reasonably short and aim for tagging
the result as 1.8.0 at the end of 9th week, on October 21st, after
which I'd disappear for a few weeks.  http://tinyurl.com/gitCal is
where you can always find my rough tagging schedule at.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches of the
repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

[Graduated to "master"]

* cn/branch-set-upstream-to (2012-09-11) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-09-12 at e162318)
 + completion: complete branch name for "branch --set-upstream-to="
 + completion: add --set-upstream-to and --unset-upstream

 Finishing touches to the recently graduated topic to introduce
 "git branch --set-upstream-to" option.


* dg/run-command-child-cleanup (2012-09-11) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-09-12 at aa5f9e2)
 + run-command.c: fix broken list iteration in clear_child_for_cleanup

 The code to wait for subprocess and remove it from our internal queue
 wasn't quite right.


* jc/ll-merge-binary-ours (2012-09-12) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-09-12 at 9a7a6b3)
 + ll-merge: warn about inability to merge binary files only when we can't
 + attr: "binary" attribute should choose built-in "binary" merge driver
 + merge: teach -Xours/-Xtheirs to binary ll-merge driver

 "git merge -Xtheirs" did not help content-level merge of binary
 files; it should just take their version.  Also "*.jpg binary" in
 the attributes did not imply they should use the binary ll-merge
 driver.


* jc/mailinfo-RE (2012-09-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-09-12 at 131edbf)
 + mailinfo: strip "RE: " prefix

 We strip the prefix from "Re: subject" and also from a less common
 "re: subject", but left even less common "RE: subject" intact.


* jc/maint-blame-no-such-path (2012-09-11) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-09-14 at 84064d5)
 + blame: allow "blame file" in the middle of a conflicted merge
 + blame $path: avoid getting fooled by case insensitive filesystems

 "git blame MAKEFILE" run in a history that has "Makefile" but not
 "MAKEFILE" should say "No such file MAKEFILE in HEAD", but got
 confused on a case insensitive filesystem and failed to do so.

 Even during a conflicted merge, "git blame $path" always meant to
 blame uncommitted changes to the "working tree" version; make it
 more useful by showing cleanly merged parts as coming from the other
 branch that is being merged.


* jk/config-warn-on-inaccessible-paths (2012-09-13) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-09-14 at a9bba78)
 + attr: failure to open a .gitattributes file is OK with ENOTDIR

 The attribute system may be asked for a path whose leading
 directories do not exist in the current working tree.  In addition
 to ENOENT, ENOTDIR must be ignored.


* jw/doc-commit-title (2012-09-13) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-09-14 at d6bdd97)
 + Documentation: describe subject more precisely

 Update parts of document that talked about "first line of commit
 log" to say "title of commit" with definition of what that "title"
 is.


* mh/fetch-filter-refs (2012-09-15) 15 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-09-15 at 8767db3)
 + test-string-list.c: Fix some sparse warnings
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-09-14 at 567afe4)
 + fetch-pack: eliminate spurious error messages
 + cmd_fetch_pack(): simplify computation of return value
 + fetch-pack: report missing refs even if no existing refs were received
 + cmd_fetch_pack(): return early if finish_connect() fails
 + filter_refs(): simplify logic
 + filter_refs(): build refs list as we go
 + filter_refs(): delete matched refs from sought list
 + fetch_pack(): update sought->nr to reflect number of unique entries
 + filter_refs(): do not check the same sought_pos twice
 + Change fetch_pack() and friends to take string_list arguments
 + fetch_pack(): reindent function decl and defn
 + Rename static function fetch_pack() to http_fetch_pack()
 + t5500: add tests of fetch-pack --all --depth=N $URL $REF
 + t5500: add tests of error output for missing refs
 (this branch uses mh/string-list.)

 Code simplification and clarification.


* mh/string-list (2012-09-12) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-09-14 at b4c50bc)
 + api-string-list.txt: initialize the string_list the easy way
 + string_list: add a function string_list_longest_prefix()
 + string_list: add a new function, string_list_remove_duplicates()
 + string_list: add a new function, filter_string_list()
 + string_list: add two new functions for splitting strings
 + string_list: add function string_list_append_nodup()
 (this branch is used by mh/fetch-filter-refs.)


* nd/maint-diffstat-summary (2012-09-14) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-09-14 at 994217d)
 + Revert diffstat back to English

 Earlier we made the diffstat summary line that shows the number of
 lines added/deleted localizable, but it was found irritating having
 to see them in various languages on a list whose discussion language
 is English.

 The original had trivial thinko in reverting Q_(), which has been
 fixed.


* sl/autoconf (2012-09-11) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-09-12 at 6ebe199)
 + build: don't duplicate substitution of make variables
 + build: improve GIT_CONF_SUBST signature

 Reduces repetition in configure.ac.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* rt/maint-clone-single (2012-09-16) 2 commits
 - fixup! check what we really care about in a more direct way
 - clone --single: limit the fetch refspec to fetched branch

 Running "git fetch" in a repository made with "git clone --single"
 slurps all the branches, defeating the point of "--single".


* ep/malloc-check-perturb (2012-09-14) 2 commits
 - MALLOC_CHECK: various clean-ups
 - Add MALLOC_CHECK_ and MALLOC_PERTURB_ libc env to the test suite for detecting heap corruption

 Queued with fix-ups.
 Waiting for response from the author.


* jc/make-static (2012-09-15) 14 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-09-17 at 3a7d87a)
 + sequencer.c: mark a private file-scope symbol as static
 + ident.c: mark private file-scope symbols as static
 + trace.c: mark a private file-scope symbol as static
 + wt-status.c: mark a private file-scope symbol as static
 + read-cache.c: mark a private file-scope symbol as static
 + strbuf.c: mark a private file-scope symbol as static

 + graph.c: mark private file-scope symbols as static
 + diff.c: mark a private file-scope symbol as static
 + commit.c: mark a file-scope private symbol as static
 + builtin/notes.c: mark file-scope private symbols as static

 Turn many file-scope private symbols to static to reduce the
 global namespace contamination.


* aj/xfuncname-ada (2012-09-16) 1 commit
 - Add userdiff patterns for Ada


* aw/rebase-i-edit-todo (2012-09-16) 3 commits
 - rebase -i: Add tests for "--edit-todo"
 - rebase -i: Teach "--edit-todo" action
 - rebase -i: Refactor help messages for todo file


* jc/maint-mailinfo-mime-attr (2012-09-17) 1 commit
 - mailinfo: do not concatenate charset= attribute values from mime headers


* js/poll-emu (2012-09-17) 4 commits
 - make poll() work on platforms that can't recv() on a non-socket
 - poll() exits too early with EFAULT if 1st arg is NULL
 - fix some win32 specific dependencies in poll.c
 - make poll available for other platforms lacking it


* nd/wildmatch (2012-09-17) 5 commits
 - Support "**" in .gitignore and .gitattributes patterns using wildmatch()
 - Integrate wildmatch to git
 - compat/wildmatch: fix case-insensitive matching
 - compat/wildmatch: remove static variable force_lower_case
 - Import wildmatch from rsync

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* ph/credential-refactor (2012-09-02) 5 commits
 - wincred: port to generic credential helper
 - Merge branch 'ef/win32-cred-helper' into ph/credential-refactor
 - osxkeychain: port to generic credential helper implementation
 - gnome-keyring: port to generic helper implementation
 - contrib: add generic credential helper

 Attempts to refactor to share code among OSX keychain, Gnome keyring
 and Win32 credential helpers.


* ms/contrib-thunderbird-updates (2012-08-31) 2 commits
 - [SQUASH] minimum fixup
 - Thunderbird: fix appp.sh format problems

 Update helper to send out format-patch output using Thunderbird.
 Seems to have design regression for silent users.


* as/check-ignore (2012-09-02) 10 commits
 . fixup: decl-after-stmt etc.
 . Add git-check-ignore
 . Provide free_directory() for reclaiming dir_struct memory
 . Extract some useful pathspec handling code from builtin/add.c into a library
 . For each exclude pattern, store information about where it came from
 . dir.c: refactor excluded() and path_excluded()
 . dir.c: refactor excluded_from_list()
 . dir.c: rename cryptic 'which' variable to more consistent name
 . Improve documentation and comments regarding directory traversal API
 . Update directory listing API doc to match code

 Will be rerolled.


* jx/test-real-path (2012-08-27) 1 commit
 - test: set the realpath of CWD as TRASH_DIRECTORY

 Running tests with the "trash" directory elsewhere with the "--root"
 option did not work well if the directory was specified by a symbolic
 link pointing at it.

 Seems broken as it makes $(pwd) and TRASH_DIRECTORY inconsistent.
 Needs rerolling.


* jc/maint-push-refs-all (2012-08-27) 2 commits
 - get_fetch_map(): tighten checks on dest refs
 - [BROKEN] fetch/push: allow refs/*:refs/*

 Allows pushing and fetching everything including refs/stash.
 This is broken (see the log message there).

 Not ready.


* jc/add-delete-default (2012-08-13) 1 commit
 - git add: notice removal of tracked paths by default

 "git add dir/" updated modified files and added new files, but does
 not notice removed files, which may be "Huh?" to some users.  They
 can of course use "git add -A dir/", but why should they?

 Resurrected from graveyard, as I thought it was a worthwhile thing
 to do in the longer term.

 Waiting for comments.


* tx/relative-in-the-future (2012-08-16) 2 commits
 - date: show relative dates in the future
 - date: refactor the relative date logic from presentation

 Not my itch; rewritten an earlier submission by Tom Xue into
 somewhat more maintainable form, though it breaks existing i18n.

 Waiting for a voluteer to fix it up.
 Otherwise may discard.


* tg/index-v5 (2012-08-17) 13 commits
 . p0002-index.sh: add perf test for the index formats
 . update-index.c: rewrite index when index-version is given
 . Write resolve-undo data for index-v5
 . Write index-v5 cache-tree data
 . Write index-v5
 . Read cache-tree in index-v5
 . Read resolve-undo data
 . Read index-v5
 . Make in-memory format aware of stat_crc
 . Add documentation of the index-v5 file format
 . t2104: Don't fail for index versions other than [23]
 . read-cache.c: Re-read index if index file changed
 . Move index v2 specific functions to their own file

 A GSoC project.  Was waiting for comments from mentors and
 stakeholders, but nothing seems to be happening, other than breakage
 fixes on Cygwin.  May discard.


* mz/rebase-range (2012-07-18) 7 commits
 . rebase (without -p): correctly calculate patches to rebase
 . rebase -p: don't request --left-right only to ignore left side
 . rebase -p: use --cherry-mark for todo file
 . git-rebase--interactive.sh: look up subject in add_pick_line
 . git-rebase--interactive: group all $preserve_merges code
 . git-rebase--interactive.sh: extract function for adding "pick" line
 . git-rebase--am.sh: avoid special-casing --keep-empty

 Expecting a reroll.

 Performance concerns from Windows folks.  Also the series lacks
 proper sign-offs.


* mb/remote-default-nn-origin (2012-07-11) 6 commits
 - Teach get_default_remote to respect remote.default.
 - Test that plain "git fetch" uses remote.default when on a detached HEAD.
 - Teach clone to set remote.default.
 - Teach "git remote" about remote.default.
 - Teach remote.c about the remote.default configuration setting.
 - Rename remote.c's default_remote_name static variables.

 When the user does not specify what remote to interact with, we
 often attempt to use 'origin'.  This can now be customized via a
 configuration variable.

 Expecting a reroll.

 "The first remote becomes the default" bit is better done as a
 separate step.


* jc/split-blob (2012-04-03) 6 commits
 - chunked-object: streaming checkout
 - chunked-object: fallback checkout codepaths
 - bulk-checkin: support chunked-object encoding
 - bulk-checkin: allow the same data to be multiply hashed
 - new representation types in the packstream
 - packfile: use varint functions

 Not ready.

 I finished the streaming checkout codepath, but as explained in
 127b177 (bulk-checkin: support chunked-object encoding, 2011-11-30),
 these are still early steps of a long and painful journey. At least
 pack-objects and fsck need to learn the new encoding for the series
 to be usable locally, and then index-pack/unpack-objects needs to
 learn it to be used remotely.

 Given that I heard a lot of noise that people want large files, and
 that I was asked by somebody at GitTogether'11 privately for an
 advice on how to pay developers (not me) to help adding necessary
 support, I am somewhat dissapointed that the original patch series
 that was sent long time ago still remains here without much comments
 and updates from the developer community. I even made the interface
 to the logic that decides where to split chunks easily replaceable,
 and I deliberately made the logic in the original patch extremely
 stupid to entice others, especially the "bup" fanbois, to come up
 with a better logic, thinking that giving people an easy target to
 shoot for, they may be encouraged to help out. The plan is not
 working :-<.

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* jc/maint-name-rev (2012-09-17) 7 commits
 - describe --contains: use "name-rev --algorithm=weight"
 - name-rev --algorithm=weight: tests and documentation
 - name-rev --algorithm=weight: cache the computed weight in notes
 - name-rev --algorithm=weight: trivial optimization
 - name-rev: --algorithm option
 - name_rev: clarify the logic to assign a new tip-name to a commit
 - name-rev: lose unnecessary typedef

 "git name-rev" names the given revision based on a ref that can be
 reached in the smallest number of steps from the rev, but that is
 not useful when the caller wants to know which tag is the oldest one
 that contains the rev.  This teaches a new mode to the command that
 uses the oldest ref among those which contain the rev.

 I am not sure if this is worth it; for one thing, even with the help
 from notes-cache, it seems to make the "describe --contains" even
 slower. Also the command will be unusably slow for a user who does
 not have a write access (hence unable to create or update the
 notes-cache).


* er/doc-fast-import-done (2012-08-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-09-17 at bb8709a)
 + fast-import: document the --done option

 I got tired of waiting for ESR to respond with S-o-b for a trivial
 documentation updates, so I'll be moving this forward.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* nd/fetch-status-alignment (2012-09-14) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-09-14 at 34237db)
 + fetch: align per-ref summary report in UTF-8 locales

 The status report from "git fetch", when messages like 'up-to-date'
 are translated, did not align the branch names well.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* mv/cherry-pick-s (2012-09-14) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-09-14 at 2d143e1)
 + cherry-pick: don't forget -s on failure

 After "git cherry-pick -s" gave control back to the user asking
 help to resolve conflicts, concluding "git commit" needs to be run
 with "-s" if the user wants to sign it off, but people often forgot
 to do so.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/maint-log-grep-all-match (2012-09-15) 10 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-09-17 at 3c10a18)
 + t7810-grep: test --all-match with multiple --grep and --author options
 + t7810-grep: test interaction of multiple --grep and --author options
 + t7810-grep: test multiple --author with --all-match
 + t7810-grep: test multiple --grep with and without --all-match
 + t7810-grep: bring log --grep tests in common form
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-09-15 at 73fad40)
 + grep.c: mark private file-scope symbols as static
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-09-14 at 86b848c)
 + log: document use of multiple commit limiting options
 + log --grep/--author: honor --all-match honored for multiple --grep patterns
 + grep: show --debug output only once
 + grep: teach --debug option to dump the parse tree

 Fix a long-standing bug in "git log --grep" when multiple "--grep"
 are used together with "--all-match" and "--author" or "--committer".


* pw/p4-submit-conflicts (2012-09-16) 12 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-09-17 at 7e57551)
 + git-p4: add submit --conflict option and config varaiable
 + git p4: add submit --prepare-p4-only option
 + git p4: add submit --dry-run option
 + git p4: accept -v for --verbose
 + git p4: revert deleted files after submit cancel
 + git p4: rearrange submit template construction
 + git p4: test clean-up after failed submit, fix added files
 + git p4: standardize submit cancel due to unchanged template
 + git p4: move conflict prompt into run, add [q]uit input
 + git p4: remove submit failure options [a]pply and [w]rite
 + git p4: gracefully fail if some commits could not be applied
 + git p4 test: remove bash-ism of combined export/assignment

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/xprm-generation (2012-09-14) 1 commit
 - test-generation: compute generation numbers and clock skews

 A toy to analyze how bad the clock skews are in histories of real
 world projects.


* rs/archive-zip-utf8 (2012-09-04) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-09-11 at 3b1f071)
 + archive-zip: support UTF-8 paths

 Need help from people on platforms on which Zip matters to see
 compatiblity with other people's zip implementations.

 Will merge to 'master' as part of the sixth batch.


* jl/submodule-rm (2012-08-27) 1 commit
 - Teach rm to remove submodules unless they contain a git directory

 "git rm submodule" cannot blindly remove a submodule directory as
 its working tree may have local changes, and worse yet, it may even
 have its repository embedded in it.  Teach it some special cases
 where it is safe to remove a submodule, specifically, when there is
 no local changes in the submodule working tree, and its repository
 is not embedded in its working tree but is elsewhere and uses the
 gitfile mechanism to point at it.

 Replacement sent but was still iffy around conflicted merge cases.


* fa/remote-svn (2012-08-28) 16 commits
 - Add a test script for remote-svn
 - remote-svn: add marks-file regeneration
 - Add a svnrdump-simulator replaying a dump file for testing
 - remote-svn: add incremental import

 - Add svndump_init_fd to allow reading dumps from arbitrary FDs
 - Add git-remote-testsvn to Makefile and .gitignore
 - Implement a remote helper for svn in C
 (this branch is used by fa/vcs-svn.)

 A GSoC project.  Looked promising.
 Waiting for comments from mentors and stakeholders.


* fa/vcs-svn (2012-08-28) 4 commits
 - vcs-svn: remove repo_tree
 - vcs-svn/svndump: rewrite handle_node(), begin|end_revision()
 - vcs-svn/svndump: restructure node_ctx, rev_ctx handling
 - svndump: move struct definitions to .h
 (this branch uses fa/remote-svn.)

 A GSoC project.  Looked promising.
 Waiting for comments from mentors and stakeholders.


* jk/no-more-pre-exec-callback (2012-06-05) 1 commit
 - pager: drop "wait for output to run less" hack

 (Originally merged to 'next' on 2012-07-23)

 Will defer until the end of the 2012.
 while waiting for older "less" to go extinct.
