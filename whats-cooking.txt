What's cooking in git.git (Aug 2022, #08; Wed, 24)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a future
release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and aren't
considered "accepted" at all.  A topic without enough support may be
discarded after a long period of no activity.

We are in the middle of the week #7 of a 12-week cycle
(cf. https://tinyurl.com/gitCal).

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/

Release tarballs are available at:

 "git rebase --keep-base" used to discard the commits that are
 already cherry-picked to the upstream, even when "keep-base" meant
 that the base, on top of which the history is being rebuilt, does
 not yet include these cherry-picked commits.  The --keep-base
 option now implies --reapply-cherry-picks and --no-fork-point
 options.

 . fetch,fetch-pack: clarify connectivity check error

 We may find an object missing after a "git fetch" stores the
 objects it obtained from the other side, but it is not necessarily
 because the remote failed to send necessary objects.  Reword the
 messages in an attempt to help users explore other possibilities
 when they hit this error.

 In stalled state for too long.
 Also it seems to break t5326 with sha256.
