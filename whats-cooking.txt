What's cooking in git.git (Feb 2022, #02; Wed, 9)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen',
which means nothing more than that I have found them of interest for
some reason (like "it may have hard-to-resolve conflicts with
another topic already in flight" or "this may turn out to be
useful").  Do not read too much into a topic being in (or not in)
'seen'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of the
integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

The second batch of topics have been merged.

Many new topics have sketchy or even empty topic description in the
list below; help to fill them in is very much appreciated ;-)

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/

 + fetch: help translators by reusing the same message template
  (merged to 'next' on 2022-01-19 at 0f15147cfa)
 + fetch --negotiate-only: do not update submodules
 + fetch: skip tasks related to fetching objects
 + fetch: use goto cleanup in cmd_fetch()

 "git fetch --negotiate-only" is an internal command used by "git
 push" to figure out which part of our history is missing from the
 other side.  It should never recurse into submodules even when
 fetch.recursesubmodules configuration variable is set, nor it
 should trigger "gc".  The code has been tightened up to ensure it
 only does common ancestry discovery and nothing else.

 implementation of qsort_s() and stable qsort().

  (merged to 'next' on 2022-01-26 at c3bb39676e)

 Cloning from a repository that does not yet have any branches or

 The conditional inclusion mechanism of configuration files using

 . http-backend: give a hint that web browser access is not supported

 When the http-backend program, which is the server-side component
 for the smart HTTP transport, sends a "404 Not found" error, we
 deliberately did not say anything to the requesting client.  We now
 send a message back to the browser to tell the user that they do
 not want to visit the URL via their browser, instead of a totally
 blank page.

 Expecting a reroll.
 Breaks its self tests.

 Give the latter a better chance to notice such situation and abort

 exit with 126 or 127 error codes, even on revisions that are marked

 Because a deletion of ref would need to remove it from both the
 loose ref store and the packed ref store, a delete-ref operation
 that logically removes one ref may end up invoking ref-transaction
 hook twice, which has been corrected.
