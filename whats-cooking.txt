What's cooking in git.git (May 2024, #02; Fri, 3)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and
aren't considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL
to a message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity (of course they can be resubmit when new interests
arise).

The first batch of topics for the new cycle have graduated to the
'master' branch, and the tip of 'next' has been rewound.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-scm/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

* jc/no-default-attr-tree-in-bare (2024-05-03) 1 commit
 - stop using HEAD for attributes in bare repository by default

 Git 2.43 started using the tree of HEAD as the source of attributes
 in a bare repository, which has severe performance implications.
 For now, revert the change, without ripping out a more explicit
 support for the attr.tree configuration variable.

 Before discovering the repository details, We used to assume SHA-1
 as the "default" hash function, which has been corrected. Hopefully
 this will smoke out codepaths that rely on such an unwarranted
 assumptions.

 When the user responds to a prompt given by "git add -p" with an

 was too much if the user knew what they wanted to type but merely
 made a typo.  Now the user gets a much shorter error message.
