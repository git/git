What's cooking in git.git (Sep 2015, #06; Wed, 23)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.

Not much has happened on the 'master' or 'next' fronts, but we have
seen quite a lot of activities above that to prepare for the next
cycle, which may or may not be a good sign.  I am sending this out
early in the middle of the week, as I'll likely to be offline all
day tomorrow.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* ls/p4-translation-failure (2015-09-22) 2 commits
 - git-p4: handle "Translation of file content failed"
 - git-p4: add test case for "Translation of file content failed" error

 Work around "git p4" failing when the P4 depot records the contents
 in UTF-16 without UTF-16 BOM.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* mr/worktree-list (2015-09-23) 6 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - worktree: add 'list' command
 - worktree: add functions to get worktree details
 - worktree: refactor find_linked_symref function
 - SQUASH???
 - worktree: add top-level worktree.c

 Add the "list" subcommand to "git worktree".


* jk/notes-dwim-doc (2015-09-22) 1 commit
 - notes: correct documentation of DWIMery for notes references

 The way how --ref/--notes to specify the notes tree reference are
 DWIMmed was not clearly documented.


* kn/for-each-branch (2015-09-23) 8 commits
 - branch: add '--points-at' option
 - branch.c: use 'ref-filter' APIs
 - branch.c: use 'ref-filter' data structures
 - branch: drop non-commit error reporting
 - branch: move 'current' check down to the presentation layer
 - branch: roll show_detached HEAD into regular ref_list
 - branch: bump get_head_description() to the top
 - branch: refactor width computation
 (this branch uses kn/for-each-tag and kn/for-each-tag-branch.)

 Update "git branch" that list existing branches, using the
 ref-filter API that is shared with "git tag" and "git
 for-each-ref".


* jc/fsck-dropped-errors (2015-09-23) 1 commit
 - fsck: exit with non-zero when problems are found

 There were some classes of errors that "git fsck" diagnosed to its
 standard error that did not cause it to exit with non-zero status.

[Stalled]

* mg/httpd-tests-update-for-apache-2.4 (2015-04-08) 2 commits
 - t/lib-git-svn: check same httpd module dirs as lib-httpd
 - t/lib-httpd: load mod_unixd

 This is the first two commits in a three-patch series $gmane/266962

 Waiting for a reroll.
 with updated log message ($gmane/268061).


* wp/sha1-name-negative-match (2015-06-08) 2 commits
 - sha1_name.c: introduce '^{/!-<negative pattern>}' notation
 - test for '!' handling in rev-parse's named commits

 Introduce "branch^{/!-<pattern>}" notation to name a commit
 reachable from branch that does not match the given pattern.

 Getting tired of waiting for a reroll.
 ($gmane/271213).


* ak/format-patch-odir-config (2015-06-19) 1 commit
 - format-patch: introduce format.outputDirectory configuration

 Reroll exists but didn't pick it up as it seemed to be still
 collecting review comments.

 Waiting for a reroll.
 ($gmane/272180).


* mh/notes-allow-reading-treeish (2015-07-13) 1 commit
 - notes: allow treeish expressions as notes ref

 Some "git notes" operations, e.g. "git log --notes=<note>", should
 be able to read notes from any tree-ish that is shaped like a notes
 tree, but the notes infrastructure required that the argument must
 be a ref under refs/notes/.  Loosen it to require a valid ref only
 when the operation would update the notes (in which case we must
 have a place to store the updated notes tree, iow, a ref).

 Needs update to docs.
 ($gmane/273928)


* jc/diff-b-m (2015-02-23) 5 commits
 . WIPWIP
 . WIP: diff-b-m
 - diffcore-rename: allow easier debugging
 - diffcore-rename.c: add locate_rename_src()
 - diffcore-break: allow debugging

 "git diff -B -M" produced incorrect patch when the postimage of a
 completely rewritten file is similar to the preimage of a removed
 file; such a resulting file must not be expressed as a rename from
 other place.

 The fix in this patch is broken, unfortunately.

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* mm/keyid-docs (2015-09-21) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-09-21 at f50ccab)
 + Documentation: explain optional arguments better
 + Documentation/grep: fix documentation of -O
 + Documentation: use 'keyid' consistently, not 'key-id'

 Very small number of options take a parameter that is optional
 (which is not a great UI element as they can only appear at the end
 of the command line).  Add notice to documentation of each and
 every one of them.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* nd/gc-auto-background-fix (2015-09-21) 1 commit
 - gc: save log from daemonized gc --auto and print it next time

 When "git gc --auto" is backgrounded, its diagnosis message is
 lost.  Save it to a file in $GIT_DIR and show it next time the "gc
 --auto" is run.


* jk/blame-first-parent (2015-09-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-09-21 at 7580f6b)
 + blame: handle --first-parent

 "git blame --first-parent v1.0..v2.0" was not rejected but did not
 limit the blame to commits on the first parent chain.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/transfer-limit-protocol (2015-09-23) 2 commits
 - submodule: allow only certain protocols for submodule fetches
 - transport: add a protocol-whitelist environment variable


* ld/p4-detached-head (2015-09-09) 2 commits
 - git-p4: work with a detached head
 - git-p4: add failing test for submit from detached head

 Will be rerolled.
 ($gmane/277574)


* jk/graph-format-padding (2015-09-14) 1 commit
 - pretty: pass graph width to pretty formatting for use in '%>|(N)'

 Redefine the way '%>|(N)' padding and the "--graph" option
 interacts.  It has been that the available columns to display the
 log message was measured from the edge of the area the graph ended,
 but with this it becomes the beginning of the entire output.

 I have a suspicion that 50% of the users would appreciate this
 change, and the remainder see this break their expectation.  If
 that is the case, we might need to introduce a similar but
 different alignment operator so that this new behaviour is
 available to those who want to use it, without negatively affecting
 existing uses.

 Undecided.
 ($gmane/278326)


* jk/make-findstring-makeflags-fix (2015-09-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-09-21 at 26ea6e0)
 + Makefile: fix MAKEFLAGS tests with multiple flags

 Customization to change the behaviour with "make -w" and "make -s"
 in our Makefile was broken when they were used together.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/rebase-no-autostash (2015-09-10) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-09-21 at 034d726)
 + Documentation/git-rebase: fix --no-autostash formatting
 + rebase: support --no-autostash

 There was no way to defeat a configured rebase.autostash variable
 from the command line, as "git rebase --no-autostash" was missing.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jw/make-arflags-customizable (2015-09-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-09-21 at cb3892c1)
 + Makefile: allow $(ARFLAGS) specified from the command line

 The Makefile always runs the library archiver with hardcoded "crs"
 options, which was inconvenient for exotic platforms on which
 people wants to use programs with totally different set of command
 line options.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* nd/ignore-then-not-ignore (2015-09-21) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-09-21 at 2182591)
 + dir.c: don't exclude whole dir prematurely if neg pattern may match
 + dir.c: make last_exclude_matching_from_list() run til the end

 Allow a later "!/abc/def" to override an earlier "/abc" that
 appears in the same .gitignore file to make it easier to express
 "everything in /abc directory is ignored, except for ...".

 Will merge to 'master'.


* sb/submodule-parallel-fetch (2015-09-23) 9 commits
 - submodules: allow parallel fetching, add tests and documentation
 - fetch_populated_submodules: use new parallel job processing
 - SQUASH???
 - run-command: add an asynchronous parallel child processor
 - run-command: factor out return value computation
 - strbuf: add strbuf_read_once to read without blocking
 - xread_nonblock: add functionality to read from fds without blocking
 - xread: poll on non blocking fds
 - submodule.c: write "Fetching submodule <foo>" to stderr
 (this branch uses sb/submodule-helper.)

 Add a framework to spawn a group of processes in parallel, and use
 it to run "git fetch --recurse-submodules" in parallel.

 It seems that the fundamentals are almost there, modulo polishing
 the overall structure to ensure that future enhancement can be made
 cleanly.


* mk/submodule-gitdir-path (2015-09-14) 2 commits
 - path: implement common_dir handling in git_pathdup_submodule()
 - submodule refactor: use strbuf_git_path_submodule() in add_submodule_odb()

 The submodule code has been taught to work better with separate
 work trees created via "git worktree add".


* jk/connect-clear-env (2015-09-08) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-09-08 at 86b64f7)
 + git_connect: clarify conn->use_shell flag
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-09-06 at 9ddbed8)
 + git_connect: clear GIT_* environment for ssh

 The ssh transport, just like any other transport over the network,
 did not clear GIT_* environment variables, but it is possible to
 use SendEnv and AcceptEnv to leak them to the remote invocation of
 Git, which is not a good idea at all.  Explicitly clear them just
 like we do for the local transport.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ti/glibc-stdio-mutex-from-signal-handler (2015-09-04) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-09-08 at c8047ba)
 + pager: don't use unsafe functions in signal handlers

 Allocation related functions and stdio are unsafe things to call
 inside a signal handler, and indeed killing the pager can cause
 glibc to deadlock waiting on allocation mutex as our signal handler
 tries to free() some data structures in wait_for_pager().  Reduce
 these unsafe calls.

 I seem to recall Peff had other ideas?  Let's revisit this in the
 next cycle.


* as/subtree-with-spaces (2015-09-08) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-09-09 at f3d763d)
 + contrib/subtree: respect spaces in a repository path
 + t7900-subtree: test the "space in a subdirectory name" case

 Update "git subtree" (in contrib/) so that it can take whitespaces
 in the pathnames, not only in the in-tree pathname but the name of
 the directory that the repository is in.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* gb/filter-branch-progress (2015-09-21) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-09-21 at 15e698d)
 + filter-branch: make report-progress more readable
 + filter-branch: add passed/remaining seconds on progress

 Give progress meter to "git filter-branch".

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/interpret-trailers-outside-a-repository (2015-09-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-09-09 at a75fce3)
 + interpret-trailers: allow running outside a repository

 Allow "git interpret-trailers" to run outside of a Git repository.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/test-lint-forbid-when-finished-in-subshell (2015-09-08) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-09-09 at 74ede61)
 + test-lib-functions: detect test_when_finished in subshell
 + t7800: don't use test_config in a subshell
 + test-lib-functions: support "test_config -C <dir> ..."
 + t5801: don't use test_when_finished in a subshell
 + t7610: don't use test_config in a subshell

 Because "test_when_finished" in our test framework queues the
 clean-up tasks to be done in a shell variable, it should not be
 used inside a subshell.  Add a mechanism to allow 'bash' to catch
 such uses, and fix the ones that were found.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ls/p4-lfs (2015-09-23) 7 commits
 - git-p4: add Git LFS backend for large file system
 - git-p4: add support for large file systems
 - git-p4: check free space during streaming
 - git-p4: add file streaming progress in verbose mode
 - git-p4: return an empty list if a list config has no values
 - git-p4: add gitConfigInt reader
 - git-p4: add optional type specifier to gitConfig reader

 Teach "git p4" to send large blobs outside the repository by
 talking to Git LFS.

 Expecting a reroll.
 ($gmane/278476).


* nd/clone-linked-checkout (2015-09-14) 5 commits
 - clone: better error when --reference is a linked checkout
 - clone: allow --local from a linked checkout
 - enter_repo: allow .git files in strict mode
 - enter_repo: avoid duplicating logic, use is_git_directory() instead
 - path.c: delete an extra space

 It was not possible to use a repository-lookalike created by "git
 worktree add" as a local source of "git clone".

 Will be rerolled.
 ($gmane/277815)


* jh/quiltimport-explicit-series-file (2015-09-01) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-09-02 at 1129ca4)
 + git-quiltimport: add commandline option --series <file>

 "quiltimport" allows to specify the series file by honoring the
 $QUILT_SERIES environment and also --series command line option.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/async-pkt-line (2015-09-01) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-09-02 at e185717)
 + pkt-line: show packets in async processes as "sideband"
 + run-command: provide in_async query function

 The debugging infrastructure for pkt-line based communication has
 been improved to mark the side-band communicatio specifically.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/date-local (2015-09-03) 11 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-09-08 at 66781d9)
 + t6300: add tests for "-local" date formats
 + t6300: make UTC and local dates different
 + date: make "local" orthogonal to date format
 + date: check for "local" before anything else
 + t6300: add test for "raw" date format
 + t6300: introduce test_date() helper
 + fast-import: switch crash-report date to iso8601
 + Documentation/rev-list: don't list date formats
 + Documentation/git-for-each-ref: don't list date formats
 + Documentation/config: don't list date formats
 + Documentation/blame-options: don't list date formats

 "git log --date=local" used to only allow to show the normal
 (default) format in the local timezone. The command learned to take
 'local' as an instruction to use the local timezone with other
 formats, e.g. "git show --date=rfc-local".

 Will merge to 'master'.


* nk/stash-show-config (2015-08-31) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-09-08 at 90dd06f)
 + stash: allow "stash show" diff output configurable

 Users who are too busy to type three extra keystrokes to ask for
 "git stash show -p" can now set stash.showPatch configuration
 varible to true to always see the actual patch, not just the list
 of paths affected with feel for the extent of damage via diffstat.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ls/p4-path-encoding (2015-09-21) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-09-21 at 0772d82)
 + git-p4: use replacement character for non UTF-8 characters in paths
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-09-17 at 7f8b9e0)
 + git-p4: improve path encoding verbose output
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-09-08 at 56514f9)
 + git-p4: add config git-p4.pathEncoding

 "git p4" learned to reencode the pathname it uses to communicate
 with the p4 depot with a new option.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ad/bisect-terms (2015-08-03) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-09-01 at ede6e64)
 + bisect: allow setting any user-specified in 'git bisect start'
 + bisect: add 'git bisect terms' to view the current terms
 + bisect: add the terms old/new
 + bisect: sanity check on terms

 The use of 'good/bad' in "git bisect" made it confusing to use when
 hunting for a state change that is not a regression (e.g. bugfix).
 The command learned 'old/new' and then allows the end user to
 say e.g. "bisect start --term-old=fast --term=new=slow" to find a
 performance regression.

 Michael's idea to make 'good/bad' more intelligent does have
 certain attractiveness ($gname/272867), and makes some of the work
 on this topic a moot point.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* dt/refs-bisection (2015-09-01) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-09-08 at 2b66bad)
 + refs: make refs/bisect/* per-worktree
 + path: optimize common dir checking
 + refs: clean up common_list

 Move the refs used during a "git bisect" session to per-worktree
 hierarchy refs/worktree/* so that independent bisect sessions can
 be done in different worktrees.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ld/p4-import-labels (2015-08-28) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-09-01 at cf9f1d6)
 + git-p4: fix P4 label import for unprocessed commits
 + git-p4: do not terminate creating tag for unknown commit
 + git-p4: failing test for ignoring invalid p4 labels

 Will merge to 'master'.


* kn/for-each-tag (2015-09-17) 17 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-09-17 at 1980952)
 + tag.c: implement '--merged' and '--no-merged' options
 + tag.c: implement '--format' option
 + tag.c: use 'ref-filter' APIs
 + tag.c: use 'ref-filter' data structures
 + ref-filter: add option to match literal pattern
 + ref-filter: add support to sort by version
 + ref-filter: add support for %(contents:lines=X)
 + ref-filter: add option to filter out tags, branches and remotes
 + ref-filter: implement an `align` atom
 + ref-filter: introduce match_atom_name()
 + ref-filter: introduce handler function for each atom
 + utf8: add function to align a string into given strbuf
 + ref-filter: introduce ref_formatting_state and ref_formatting_stack
 + ref-filter: move `struct atom_value` to ref-filter.c
 + strtoul_ui: reject negative values
 + Merge 'jk/git-path' into kn/for-each-tag
 + Merge 'kn/for-each-tag-branch' into kn/for-each-tag
 (this branch is used by kn/for-each-branch; uses kn/for-each-tag-branch.)

 The "ref-filter" code was taught about many parts of what "tag -l"
 does and then "tag -l" is reimplemented in terms of "ref-filter".

 Will merge to 'master'.


* nd/ita-cleanup (2015-09-06) 6 commits
 - grep: make it clear i-t-a entries are ignored
 - checkout(-index): do not checkout i-t-a entries
 - apply: make sure check_preimage() does not leave empty file on error
 - apply: fix adding new files on i-t-a entries
 - add and use a convenience macro ce_intent_to_add()
 - blame: remove obsolete comment

 Paths that have been told the index about with "add -N" are not yet
 in the index, but various commands behaved as if they already are.

 Some commits need better explanation.

 Waiting for a reroll.


* dk/gc-idx-wo-pack (2015-08-17) 3 commits
 - DONTMERGE: log message, grace-period and tests $gmane/276058
 - gc: remove stale .idx files without corresponding .pack file
 - prepare_packed_git(): refactor garbage reporting in pack directory

 Having a leftover .idx file without correspoinding .pack file in
 the repository hurts performance; "git gc" learned to prune them.

 Waiting for a reroll.


* bb/remote-get-url (2015-09-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-09-21 at c07a1e8)
 + remote: add get-url subcommand

 "git remote" learned "get-url" subcommand to show the URL for a
 given remote name used for fetching and pushing.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* sb/submodule-helper (2015-09-08) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-09-21 at 9354b31)
 + submodule: rewrite `module_clone` shell function in C
 + submodule: rewrite `module_name` shell function in C
 + submodule: rewrite `module_list` shell function in C
 + Merge 'hv/submodule-config' to 'sb/submodule-helper'
 (this branch is used by sb/submodule-parallel-fetch.)

 The infrastructure to rewrite "git submodule" in C is being built
 incrementally.  Let's polish these early parts well enough and make
 them graduate to 'next' and 'master', so that the more involved
 follow-up can start cooking on a solid ground.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ad/cygwin-wants-rename (2015-08-07) 1 commit
 - config.mak.uname: Cygwin needs OBJECT_CREATION_USES_RENAMES

 Will hold.
 ($gmane/275680).


* kn/for-each-tag-branch (2015-08-03) 11 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-08-03 at d9e94b9)
 + for-each-ref: add '--contains' option
 + ref-filter: implement '--contains' option
 + parse-options.h: add macros for '--contains' option
 + parse-option: rename parse_opt_with_commit()
 + for-each-ref: add '--merged' and '--no-merged' options
 + ref-filter: implement '--merged' and '--no-merged' options
 + ref-filter: add parse_opt_merge_filter()
 + for-each-ref: add '--points-at' option
 + ref-filter: implement '--points-at' option
 + tag: libify parse_opt_points_at()
 + t6302: for-each-ref tests for ref-filter APIs
 (this branch is used by kn/for-each-branch and kn/for-each-tag.)

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2015-07-15

 Some features from "git tag -l" and "git branch -l" have been made
 available to "git for-each-ref" so that eventually the unified
 implementation can be shared across all three, in a follow-up
 series or two.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/rerere (2015-07-24) 21 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-08-26 at 8ae15ef)
 + rerere: un-nest merge() further
 + rerere: use "struct rerere_id" instead of "char *" for conflict ID
 + rerere: call conflict-ids IDs
 + rerere: further clarify do_rerere_one_path()
 + rerere: further de-dent do_plain_rerere()
 + rerere: refactor "replay" part of do_plain_rerere()
 + rerere: explain the remainder
 + rerere: explain "rerere forget" codepath
 + rerere: explain the primary codepath
 + rerere: explain MERGE_RR management helpers
 + rerere: fix benign off-by-one non-bug and clarify code
 + rerere: explain the rerere I/O abstraction
 + rerere: do not leak mmfile[] for a path with multiple stage #1 entries
 + rerere: stop looping unnecessarily
 + rerere: drop want_sp parameter from is_cmarker()
 + rerere: report autoupdated paths only after actually updating them
 + rerere: write out each record of MERGE_RR in one go
 + rerere: lift PATH_MAX limitation
 + rerere: plug conflict ID leaks
 + rerere: handle conflicts with multiple stage #1 entries
 + rerere: fix an off-by-one non-bug
 (this branch is used by jc/rerere-multi.)

 Code clean-up and minor fixes.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/rerere-multi (2015-09-14) 7 commits
 - rerere: do use multiple variants
 - t4200: rerere a merge with two identical conflicts
 - rerere: allow multiple variants to exist
 - rerere: delay the recording of preimage
 - rerere: handle leftover rr-cache/$ID directory and postimage files
 - rerere: scan $GIT_DIR/rr-cache/$ID when instantiating a rerere_id
 - rerere: split conflict ID further
 (this branch uses jc/rerere.)

 "git rerere" can encounter two or more files with the same conflict
 signature that have to be resolved in different ways, but there was
 no way to record these separate resolutions.


* jc/merge-drop-old-syntax (2015-04-29) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-08-03 at a52c2b2)
 + merge: drop 'git merge <message> HEAD <commit>' syntax

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2015-05-28

 Stop supporting "git merge <message> HEAD <commit>" syntax that
 has been deprecated since October 2007.

 Will keep in 'next' during the 2.6 cycle.

 . ls-files: add --color to highlight file names
 . ls-files: buffer full item in strbuf before printing
 . ls_colors.c: highlight submodules like directories
 . ls_colors.c: add a function to color a file name
 . ls_colors.c: parse color.ls.* from config file
 . ls_colors.c: add $LS_COLORS parsing code

 A new "git list-files" Porcelain command, "ls-files" with bells and
 whistles.

 Reroll to base on wt-status work ($gmane/265142) has seen some
 positive discussions.

* mh/numparse (2015-03-19) 14 commits
 . diff_opt_parse(): use convert_i() when handling --abbrev=<num>
 . diff_opt_parse(): use convert_i() when handling "-l<num>"
 . opt_arg(): simplify pointer handling
 . opt_arg(): report errors parsing option values
 . opt_arg(): use convert_i() in implementation
 . opt_arg(): val is always non-NULL
 . builtin_diff(): detect errors when parsing --unified argument
 . handle_revision_opt(): use convert_ui() when handling "--abbrev="
 . strtoul_ui(), strtol_i(): remove functions
 . handle_revision_opt(): use convert_i() when handling "-<digit>"
 . handle_revision_opt(): use skip_prefix() in many places
 . write_subdirectory(): use convert_ui() for parsing mode
 . cacheinfo_callback(): use convert_ui() when handling "--cacheinfo"
 . numparse: new module for parsing integral numbers

 Many codepaths use unchecked use of strtol() and friends (or even
 worse, atoi()).  Introduce a set of wrappers that try to be more
 careful.

* kk/log-merges-config (2015-04-21) 5 commits
 . bash-completion: add support for git-log --merges= and log.merges
 . t4202-log: add tests for --merges=
 . Documentation: add git-log --merges= option and log.merges config. var
 . log: honor log.merges= option
 . revision: add --merges={show|only|hide} option

 "git log" (but not other commands in the "log" family) learned to
 pay attention to the log.merges configuration variable that can be
 set to "show" (the normal behaviour), "only" (hide non-merge
 commits), or "hide" (hide merge commits).  --merges=(show|only|hide)
 can be used to override the setting from the command line.

 The documentation may need to be updated once more ($gmane/267250).

* jc/clone-bundle (2015-04-30) 1 commit
 . repack: optionally create a clone.bundle

 Still an early WIP.


* mg/index-read-error-messages (2015-06-01) 2 commits
 . messages: uniform error messages for index write
 . show-index: uniform error messages for index read

 The tip was RFC.
 Waiting for a reroll.


* mk/utf8-no-iconv-warn (2015-06-08) 1 commit
 . utf8.c: print warning about disabled iconv

 Warn when a reencoding is requested in a build without iconv
 support, as the end user is likely to get an unexpected result.  I
 think the same level of safety should be added to a build with
 iconv support when the specified encoding is not available, but the
 patch does not go there.

 ($gmane/277424).


* pw/remote-set-url-fetch (2014-11-26) 1 commit
 . remote: add --fetch and --both options to set-url

 Ejected.


* tr/remerge-diff (2014-11-10) 9 commits
 . t4213: avoid "|" in sed regexp
 . log --remerge-diff: show what the conflict resolution changed
 . name-hash: allow dir hashing even when !ignore_case
 . merge-recursive: allow storing conflict hunks in index
 . merge_diff_mode: fold all merge diff variants into an enum
 . combine-diff: do not pass revs->dense_combined_merges redundantly
 . merge-recursive: -Xindex-only to leave worktree unchanged
 . merge-recursive: internal flag to avoid touching the worktree
 . merge-recursive: remove dead conditional in update_stages()

 "log -p" output learns a new way to let users inspect a merge
 commit by showing the differences between the automerged result
 with conflicts the person who recorded the merge would have seen
 and the final conflict resolution that was recorded in the merge.

 Waiting for a reroll.

* tg/perf-lib-test-perf-cleanup (2013-09-19) 2 commits
 . perf-lib: add test_perf_cleanup target
 . perf-lib: split starting the test from the execution

 Add test_perf_cleanup shell function to the perf suite, that allows
 the script writers to define a test with a clean-up action.


* jc/show-branch (2014-03-24) 5 commits
 . show-branch: use commit slab to represent bitflags of arbitrary width
 . show-branch.c: remove "all_mask"
 . show-branch.c: abstract out "flags" operation
 . show-branch.c: lift all_mask/all_revs to a global static
 . show-branch.c: update comment style

 Waiting for the final step to lift the hard-limit.
