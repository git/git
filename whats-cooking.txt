What's cooking in git.git (Apr 2011, #06; Mon, 25)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.

The main part of this cycle is expected to run thru May, aiming for a
feature freeze in early June.  We are at the beginning of week #1 of this
cycle and week #2 starts on May 2nd.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* jn/setup-revisions-glob-and-friends-passthru (2011-04-21) 2 commits
 - revisions: allow --glob and friends in parse_options-enabled commands
 - revisions: split out handle_revision_pseudo_opt function

* mg/x-years-12-months (2011-04-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-04-25 at 74ba83b)
 + date: avoid "X years, 12 months" in relative dates

Will merge to "master" by the end of week #1.

* jc/fix-add-u-unmerged (2011-04-20) 1 commit
 - Fix "add -u" that sometimes fails to resolve unmerged paths
 (this branch uses jc/fix-diff-files-unmerged.)

* jc/fix-diff-files-unmerged (2011-04-22) 4 commits
 - diff-files: show unmerged entries correctly
 - diff: remove often unused parameters from diff_unmerge()
 - diff.c: return filepair from diff_unmerge()
 - test: use $_z40 from test-lib
 (this branch is used by jc/fix-add-u-unmerged.)

* js/maint-1.6.6-send-pack-stateless-rpc-deadlock-fix (2011-04-25) 1 commit
 - send-pack: avoid deadlock when pack-object dies early
 (this branch is used by js/maint-send-pack-stateless-rpc-deadlock-fix.)

* js/maint-send-pack-stateless-rpc-deadlock-fix (2011-04-25) 1 commit
 - Merge branch 'js/maint-1.6.6-send-pack-stateless-rpc-deadlock-fix' into js/maint-send-pack-stateless-rpc-deadlock-fix
 (this branch uses js/maint-1.6.6-send-pack-stateless-rpc-deadlock-fix.)

* vh/git-svn-doc (2011-04-25) 1 commit
 - git-svn.txt: fix usage of --add-author-from

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* jk/maint-merge-rename-create (2011-03-25) 3 commits
 - merge: turn on rewrite detection
 - merge: handle renames with replacement content
 - t3030: fix accidental success in symlink rename

Peff wanted to reroll this, so this is taken out of "next".

* dm/http-cleanup (2011-03-30) 2 commits
 - http-push: refactor curl_easy_setup madness
 - http: make curl callbacks match contracts from curl header

I didn't see anything glaringly wrong with this, but I would appreciate
extra sets of eyeballs from people who have worked on HTTP transports to
double check.

* jk/maint-push-async-hang (2011-03-31) 4 commits
 - send-pack: abort sideband demuxer on pack-objects error
 - run-command: allow aborting async code prematurely
 - finish_async: be quiet when waiting for async process
 - teach wait_or_whine a "quiet" mode
 (this branch is used by jk/maint-push-async-hang-threads.)

* jk/maint-push-async-hang-threads (2011-03-31) 2 commits
 - run-command: implement abort_async for pthreads
 - Merge branch 'jk/maint-push-async-hang' into jk/maint-push-async-hang-threads
 (this branch uses jk/maint-push-async-hang.)

These two series aim for a good goal, but needs reroll after 1.7.5 with
sign-offs.

* rr/rerere-clear-libify (2011-04-13) 1 commit
 - rerere: Expose an API corresponding to 'clear' functionality

Jonathan had good comments on moving the garbage collection interface as
well. Perhaps needs a re-roll.

* jc/maint-add-p-overlapping-hunks (2011-04-06) 2 commits
 - "add -p": work-around an old laziness that does not coalesce hunks
 - add--interactive.perl: factor out repeated --recount option

This came from http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/170685/focus=171000;
we may want to add tests before moving it forward.

* mg/show-without-prune (2011-04-01) 1 commit
 - builtin/show: do not prune by pathspec
 (this branch uses mg/reflog-with-options.)

I wanted to like this, but it still feels like too much magic.  Will drop
and wait for the topic to resurface.

* gr/cvsimport-alternative-cvspass-location (2011-02-18) 1 commit
 - Look for password in both CVS and CVSNT password files.

It seems that we need separate parsers for these two formats in order not
to regress the users of the original cvs.

* jc/index-pack (2011-02-25) 5 commits
 - index-pack --verify: read anomalous offsets from v2 idx file
 - write_idx_file: need_large_offset() helper function
 - index-pack: --verify
 - write_idx_file: introduce a struct to hold idx customization options
 - index-pack: group the delta-base array entries also by type

Still a WIP. Need to put histogram output into index-pack --verify to
really kill verify-pack.

* jk/tag-contains (2010-07-05) 4 commits
 - Why is "git tag --contains" so slow?
 - default core.clockskew variable to one day
 - limit "contains" traversals based on commit timestamp
 - tag: speed up --contains calculation

The idea of the bottom one is probably Ok, except that the use of object
flags needs to be rethought, or at least the helper needs to be moved to
builtin/tag.c to make it clear that it should not be used outside the
current usage context.

--------------------------------------------------
