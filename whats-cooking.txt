What's cooking in git.git (Feb 2016, #08; Fri, 26)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

v2.8-rc0 has been tagged; this is a preview for the next release.

In previous cycles, I often left many topics in 'next' when tagging
this zero-th preview, but eventually merged them before the final.
I decided to do things a bit differently for this cycle: a topic,
once it hits 'next', will not be rewound and only refined and
corrected with incremental updates, so the only effect such a late
merge to 'master' before the final is that some topics are not as
widely tested on 'master' before the final one is tagged.

So this -rc0 is deliberately aggressive in that it includes all
topics that have been cooking in 'next' that I think we can fix bugs
that might still lurking in them before the final (it merges 25
topics since the last batch to 'master').  The topics not merged to
this preview, on the other hand, will not be considered for 2.8
final, even though I might later succumb to the temptation to pick
up ones that are in 'next' as of today ;-)

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches of the
repositories listed at

  (merged to 'next' on 2016-02-25 at 8f18cc1)
 + t3034: test deprecated interface
 + t3034: test option to disable renames
 + t3034: add rename threshold tests

 + merge-strategies.txt: fix typo
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-02-18 at dd6125b)
 + merge-recursive: more consistent interface
 + merge-recursive: option to disable renames

 "git merge-recursive" learned "--no-renames" option to disable its
 rename detection logic.


* jg/credential-cache-chdir-to-sockdir (2016-02-23) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-02-25 at ad35811)
 + credential-cache--daemon: change to the socket dir on startup
 + credential-cache--daemon: disallow relative socket path
 + credential-cache--daemon: refactor check_socket_directory

 The "credential-cache" daemon process used to run in whatever
 directory it happened to start in, but this made umount(2)ing the
 filesystem that houses the repository harder; now the process
 chdir()s to the directory that house its own socket on startup.


* jk/epipe-in-async (2016-02-25) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-02-25 at 4482ddf)
 + t5504: handle expected output from SIGPIPE death
 + test_must_fail: report number of unexpected signal
 + fetch-pack: ignore SIGPIPE in sideband demuxer
 + write_or_die: handle EPIPE in async threads

 Handling of errors while writing into our internal asynchronous
 process has been made more robust, which reduces flakiness in our
 tests.


* jk/grep-binary-workaround-in-test (2016-02-23) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-02-25 at 0e96ae8)
 + t9200: avoid grep on non-ASCII data
 + t8005: avoid grep on non-ASCII data

 Recent versions of GNU grep are pickier when their input contains
 arbitrary binary data, which some of our tests uses.  Rewrite the
 tests to sidestep the problem.


* jk/more-comments-on-textconv (2016-02-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-02-24 at 4ccfdc5)
 + diff: clarify textconv interface

 The memory ownership rule of fill_textconv() API, which was a bit
 tricky, has been documented a bit better.


* jk/no-diff-emit-common (2016-02-22) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-02-24 at 72626ea)
 + xdiff: drop XDL_EMIT_COMMON
 + merge-tree: drop generate_common strategy
 + merge-one-file: use empty blob for add/add base

 "git merge-tree" used to mishandle "both sides added" conflict with
 its own "create a fake ancestor file that has the common parts of
 what both sides have added and do a 3-way merge" logic; this has
 been updated to use the usual "3-way merge with an empty blob as
 the fake common ancestor file" approach used in the rest of the
 system.

  (merged to 'next' on 2016-02-25 at a675267)
 + git config: report when trying to modify a non-existing repo config

 "git config section.var value" to set a value in per-repository
 configuration file failed when it was run outside any repository,
 but didn't say the reason correctly.

 + ref-filter: introduce struct used_atom
 + ref-filter: bump 'used_atom' and related code to the top
 + ref-filter: use string_list_split over strbuf_split

 The ref-filter's format-parsing code has been refactored, in
 preparation for "branch --format" and friends.


* ls/config-origin (2016-02-22) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-02-24 at 239fcc2)
 + config: add '--show-origin' option to print the origin of a config value
 + config: add 'origin_type' to config_source struct
 + rename git_config_from_buf to git_config_from_mem
 + t: do not hide Git's exit code in tests using 'nul_to_q'

 The configuration system has been taught to phrase where it found a
 bad configuration variable in a better way in its error messages.
 "git config" learnt a new "--show-origin" option to indicate where
 the values come from.


* ls/makefile-cflags-developer-tweak (2016-02-25) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-02-25 at 14bb065)

* mg/work-tree-tests (2016-02-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-02-25 at ca8cbb0)
 + tests: rename work-tree tests to *work-tree*

 Traditionally, the tests that try commands that work on the
 contents in the working tree were named with "worktree" in their
 filenames, but with the recent addition of "git worktree"
 subcommand, whose tests are also named similarly, it has become
 harder to tell them apart.  The traditional tests have been renamed
 to use "work-tree" instead in an attempt to differentiate them.


* mm/push-default-warning (2016-02-25) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-02-25 at 753352f)
 + push: remove "push.default is unset" warning message

 Across the transition at around Git version 2.0, the user used to
 get a pretty loud warning when running "git push" without setting
 push.default configuration variable.  We no longer warn, given that
 the transition is over long time ago.


* mm/push-simple-doc (2016-02-23) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-02-25 at dc4f57c)
 + Documentation/git-push: document that 'simple' is the default

 The documentation did not clearly state that the 'simple' mode is
 now the default for "git push" when push.default configuration is
 not set.


* mm/readme-markdown (2016-02-25) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-02-25 at b8bda29)

 README has been renamed to README.md and its contents got tweaked
 slightly to make it easier on the eyes.


* ps/config-error (2016-02-22) 15 commits

 + submodule: die on config error when linking modules
 + branch: die on config error when editing branch description
 + branch: die on config error when unsetting upstream
 + branch: report errors in tracking branch setup
 + config: introduce set_or_die wrappers

 Many codepaths forget to check return value from git_config_set();
 the function is made to die() to make sure we do not proceed when
 setting a configuration variable failed.


* ps/plug-xdl-merge-leak (2016-02-23) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-02-25 at 523609e)

* sb/submodule-fetch-nontip (2016-02-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-02-25 at 1e412f0)
 + submodule: try harder to fetch needed sha1 by direct fetching sha1

 When "git submodule update" did not result in fetching the commit
 object in the submodule that is referenced by the superproject, the
 command learned to retry another fetch, specifically asking for
 that commit that may not be connected to the refs it usually
 fetches.


* sb/submodule-module-list-fix (2016-02-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-02-25 at 21be607)
 + submodule helper list: respect correct path prefix

 A helper function "git submodule" uses since v2.7.0 to list the
 modules that match the pathspec argument given to its subcommands
 (e.g. "submodule add <repo> <path>") has been fixed.


* tb/conversion (2016-02-23) 7 commits

* tg/git-remote (2016-02-16) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-02-18 at 091d43e)
 + remote: use remote_is_configured() for add and rename
 + remote: actually check if remote exits
 + remote: simplify remote_is_configured()
 + remote: use parse_config_key

 The internal API to interact with "remote.*" configuration
 variables has been streamlined.

[New Topics]

* jk/credential-clear-config (2016-02-26) 1 commit
 - credential: let empty credential specs reset helper list

 The credential.helper configuration variable is cumulative and
 there is no good way to override it from the command line.  As
 a special case, giving an empty string as its value now serves
 as the signal to clear the values specified in various files.


* jk/submodule-c-credential (2016-02-25) 1 commit
 - git: submodule honor -c credential.* from command line
 (this branch uses mg/httpd-tests-update-for-apache-2.4.)

 "git -c credential.<var>=<value> submodule" can now be used to
 propagate configuration variables related to credential helper
 down to the submodules.

* js/am-3-merge-recursive-direct (2015-10-12) 2 commits
 - am: make a direct call to merge_recursive
 - merge_recursive_options: introduce the "gently" flag

 The merge_recursive_generic() function has been made a bit safer to
 call from inside a process.  "git am -3" was taught to make a direct
 call to the function when falling back to three-way merge.

 Being able to make a direct call would be good in general, but as a
 performance thing, the change needs to be backed up by numbers.

 Needs review.

 I haven't gone through the "gently" change with fine toothed comb;
 I can see that the change avoids calling die(), but I haven't made
 sure that the program states (e.g. what's in the in-core index) are
 adjusted sensibly when it returns to the caller instead of dying,
 or the codepaths that used to die() are free of resource leaks.
 The original code certainly did not care the program states at the
 point of dying exactly because it knew it is going to exit, but now
 they have to care, and they need to be audited.


* dk/gc-more-wo-pack (2016-01-13) 4 commits

 Follow-on to dk/gc-idx-wo-pack topic, to clean up stale
 .bitmap and .keep files.

* jc/diff-b-m (2015-02-23) 5 commits
 . WIPWIP
 . WIP: diff-b-m
 - diffcore-rename: allow easier debugging
 - diffcore-rename.c: add locate_rename_src()
 - diffcore-break: allow debugging

 "git diff -B -M" produced incorrect patch when the postimage of a
 completely rewritten file is similar to the preimage of a removed
 file; such a resulting file must not be expressed as a rename from
 other place.

 The fix in this patch is broken, unfortunately.
 Will discard.

* mg/httpd-tests-update-for-apache-2.4 (2016-02-25) 1 commit
 - t/lib-httpd: load mod_unixd
 (this branch is used by jk/submodule-c-credential.)


* nd/shallow-deepen (2016-02-23) 25 commits
 - fetch, upload-pack: --deepen=N extends shallow boundary by N commits
 - upload-pack: add get_reachable_list()
 - upload-pack: split check_unreachable() in two, prep for get_reachable_list()
 - t5500, t5539: tests for shallow depth excluding a ref
 - clone: define shallow clone boundary with --shallow-exclude
 - fetch: define shallow boundary with --shallow-exclude
 - upload-pack: support define shallow boundary by excluding revisions
 - refs: add expand_ref()
 - t5500, t5539: tests for shallow depth since a specific date
 - clone: define shallow clone boundary based on time with --shallow-since
 - fetch: define shallow boundary with --shallow-since
 - upload-pack: add deepen-since to cut shallow repos based on time
 - shallow.c: implement a generic shallow boundary finder based on rev-list
 - fetch-pack: use a separate flag for fetch in deepening mode
 - fetch-pack: use a common function for verbose printing
 - fetch-pack: use skip_prefix() instead of starts_with()
 - upload-pack: move rev-list code out of check_non_tip()
 - upload-pack: tighten number parsing at "deepen" lines
 - upload-pack: use skip_prefix() instead of starts_with()
 - upload-pack: move "unshallow" sending code out of deepen()
 - upload-pack: remove unused variable "backup"
 - upload-pack: move "shallow" sending code out of deepen()
 - upload-pack: move shallow deepen code out of receive_needs()
 - transport-helper.c: refactor set_helper_option()
 - remote-curl.c: convert fetch_git() to use argv_array

 The existing "git fetch --depth=<n>" option was hard to use
 correctly when making the history of an existing shallow clone
 deeper.  A new option, "--deepen=<n>", has been added to make this
 easier to use.  "git clone" also learned "--shallow-since=<date>"
 and "--shallow-exclude=<tag>" options to make it easier to specify
 "I am interested only in the recent N months worth of history" and
 "Give me only the history since that version".

 Needs review.


* jk/pack-idx-corruption-safety (2016-02-25) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-02-26 at ef0d6de)
 + use_pack: handle signed off_t overflow
 + nth_packed_object_offset: bounds-check extended offset
 + t5313: test bounds-checks of corrupted/malicious pack/idx files

 The code to read the pack data using the offsets stored in the pack
 idx file has been made more carefully check the validity of the
 data in the idx.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* mm/diff-renames-default (2016-02-25) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-02-25 at 947c399)
 + diff: activate diff.renames by default
 + log: introduce init_log_defaults()
 + t: add tests for diff.renames (true/false/unset)
 + t4001-diff-rename: wrap file creations in a test
 + Documentation/diff-config: fix description of diff.renames

 The end-user facing Porcelain level commands like "diff" and "log"
 now enables the rename detection by default.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* mp/upload-pack-use-embedded-args (2016-02-25) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-02-26 at f0a54e5)
 + upload-pack: use argv_array for pack_objects

 The embedded args argv-array in the child process is used to build
 the command line to run pack-objects instead of using a separate
 array of strings.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 - submodule: port init from shell to C

* az/p4-bare-no-rebase (2016-02-19) 1 commit
 - git-p4.py: Don't try to rebase on submit from bare repository

 "git p4 submit" attempts to do a rebase, which would fail if done
 in a bare repository.  Not doing this rebase would paper over the
 failure, which is what this patch does, but it is unclear what the
 side effect of not rebasing is.

 Needs a better explanation.

* ss/commit-dry-run-resolve-merge-to-no-op (2016-02-17) 1 commit
 - wt-status.c: set commitable bit if there is a meaningful merge.

 "git commit --dry-run" reported "No, no, you cannot commit." in one
 case where "git commit" would have allowed you to commit, and this
 improves it a little bit ("git commit --dry-run --short" still does
 not give you the correct answer, for example).


* nd/icase (2016-02-15) 12 commits
 - grep.c: reuse "icase" variable
 - diffcore-pickaxe: support case insensitive match on non-ascii
 - diffcore-pickaxe: "share" regex error handling code

 - gettext: add is_utf8_locale()
 - grep/pcre: prepare locale-dependent tables for icase matching
 - grep/icase: avoid kwsset when -F is specified
 - grep/icase: avoid kwsset on literal non-ascii strings
 - test-regex: expose full regcomp() to the command line
 - test-regex: isolate the bug test code
 - grep: break down an "if" stmt in preparation for next changes
 - grep: allow -F -i combination

 "git grep -i" has been taught to fold case in non-ascii locales.

* sb/submodule-parallel-update (2016-02-25) 11 commits
 - clone: allow an explicit argument for parallel submodule clones
 - submodule update: expose parallelism to the user
 - git submodule update: have a dedicated helper for cloning
 - run_processes_parallel: correctly terminate callbacks with an LF
 - run_processes_parallel: rename parameters for the callbacks
 - run-command: expose default_{start_failure, task_finished}
 - run_processes_parallel: treat output of children as byte array
 - submodule update: direct error message to stderr
 - fetching submodules: respect `submodule.fetchJobs` config option
 - submodule-config: drop check against NULL
 - submodule-config: keep update strategy around
 (this branch is used by dt/refs-backend-lmdb and sb/submodule-init.)

 A major part of "git submodule update" has been ported to C to take
 advantage of the recently added framework to run download tasks in
 parallel.

 Seems to break tests when merged to the tip of 'pu'.
