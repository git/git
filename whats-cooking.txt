Subject: What's cooking in git.git (Sep 2019, #01; Sat, 7)
X-master-at: 745f6812895b31c02b29bdfe4ae8e5498f776c26

What's cooking in git.git (Sep 2019, #01; Sat, 7)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

The tip of 'next' has been rewound.  A handful of topics that have
been in the stalled state need to be woken up, now the release is
over (or they can be dropped without prejudice, just to unclutter
the tree).  As I said in an earlier message somewhere, I'd prefer to
see the PCRE/JIT topics sorted out soonish.  Ævar?  Carlo?

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

 stress more that it is about "matching", as it has been reused for
 things like sparse checkout specification that want to check if a
 path is "included".

 the same kind of enhancement to the same API function.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* es/walken-tutorial (2019-08-07) 1 commit
 - documentation: add tutorial for revision walking

 A tutorial on object enumeration.

 Perhaps take the thing with as little tweaks as possible, retitling
 it to "my first object enumeration" or something?
 cf. <20190814183328.GA40797@google.com>


* dl/format-patch-cover-letter-subject (2019-09-05) 1 commit
 - format-patch: learn --infer-cover-subject option
 (this branch uses dl/format-patch-doc-test-cleanup.)

 "git format-patch --cover-letter" learned to optionally use the
 first paragraph (typically a single-liner) of branch.*.description
 as the subject of the cover letter.

 Reroll with a redesign with less emphasis on "subject" coming?

* mt/threaded-grep-in-object-store (2019-08-13) 4 commits
 - grep: re-enable threads in some non-worktree cases
 - grep: disable grep_read_mutex when possible
 - grep: allow locks to be enabled individually
 - object-store: add lock to read_object_file_extended()

 Traditionally, we avoided threaded grep while searching in objects
 (as opposed to files in the working tree) as accesses to the object
 layer is not thread-safe.  This limitation is getting lifted.

 Comments?
 cf. <cover.1565468806.git.matheus.bernardino@usp.br>

 The JSON output produced by "trace2" subsystem now has JSON schema
 defined on it, to allow us validate the output and catch deviation.

 The CI integration may be a bit too heavy-handed.


* jn/unknown-index-extensions (2018-11-21) 2 commits
 - index: offer advice for unknown index extensions
 - index: do not warn about unrecognized extensions

 A bit too alarming warning given when unknown index extensions
 exist is getting revamped.

 Expecting a reroll.


* jc/format-patch-delay-message-id (2019-04-05) 1 commit
 - format-patch: move message-id and related headers to the end

 The location "git format-patch --thread" adds the Message-Id:
 header in the series of header fields has been moved down, which
 may help working around a suspected bug in GMail MSA, reported at
 <CAHk-=whP1stFZNAaJiMi5eZ9rj0MRt20Y_yHVczZPH+O01d+sA@mail.gmail.com>

 Waiting for feedback to see if it truly helps.

 WIP for allowing a response to "git fetch" to instruct the bulk of
 the pack contents to be instead taken from elsewhere (aka CDN).


* js/protocol-advertise-multi (2018-12-28) 1 commit
 - protocol: advertise multiple supported versions

 The transport layer has been updated so that the protocol version
 used can be negotiated between the parties, by the initiator
 listing the protocol versions it is willing to talk, and the other
 side choosing from one of them.

 Expecting a reroll.

* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2018-10-15) 1 commit
 - zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".


* dl/remote-save-to-push (2018-12-11) 1 commit
 - remote: add --save-to-push option to git remote set-url

 "git remote set-url" learned a new option that moves existing value
 of the URL field to pushURL field of the remote before replacing
 the URL field with a new value.

 Anybody who wants to champion this topic?
 I am personally not yet quite convinced if this is worth pursuing.

  (merged to 'next' on 2019-08-23 at 6544c9dbb3)
 + Merge branch 'py/call-do-quit-before-exit' of github.com:gitster/git-gui into py/git-gui-do-quit
 + git-gui: call do_quit before destroying the main window

 "git gui" learned to call the clean-up procedure before exiting.

* bc/reread-attributes-during-rebase (2019-09-03) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-09-07 at 9f5e5db0b0)
 + am: reload .gitattributes after patching it
 + path: add a function to check for path suffix

 The "git am" based backend of "git rebase" ignored the result of
 updating ".gitattributes" done in one step when replaying
 subsequent steps.

* jk/drop-release-pack-memory (2019-08-13) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-09-07 at 30f841c42d)
 + packfile: drop release_pack_memory()
 (this branch is used by cb/curl-use-xmalloc.)

 xmalloc() used to have a mechanism to ditch memory and address
 space resources as the last resort upon seeing an allocation
 failure from the underlying malloc(), which made the code complex
 and thread-unsafe with dubious benefit, as major memory resource
 users already do limit their uses with various other mechanisms.
 It has been simplified away.

 Command line completion updates for "git -c var.name=val"

 Will merge to 'master'.


* cb/fetch-set-upstream (2019-08-19) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-08-23 at cf8c2ea0a0)
 + pull, fetch: add --set-upstream option

 "git fetch" learned "--set-upstream" option to help those who first
 clone from their private fork they intend to push to, add the true
 upstream via "git remote add" and then "git fetch" from it.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* js/pre-merge-commit-hook (2019-08-07) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-09-07 at 0c9f25399c)
 + merge: --no-verify to bypass pre-merge-commit hook
 + git-merge: honor pre-merge-commit hook
 + merge: do no-verify like commit
 + t7503: verify proper hook execution

 A new "pre-merge-commit" hook has been introduced.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/eoo (2019-08-06) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-08-23 at 217e97127a)
 + gitcli: document --end-of-options
 + parse-options: allow --end-of-options as a synonym for "--"
 + revision: allow --end-of-options to end option parsing

 The command line parser learned "--end-of-options" notation; the
 standard convention for scripters to have hardcoded set of options
 first on the command line, and force the command to treat end-user
 input as non-options, has been to use "--" as the delimiter, but
 that would not work for commands that use "--" as a delimiter
 between revs and pathspec.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/repo-init-cleanup (2019-08-06) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-08-23 at 1a5e4c4f06)

 + common-main: delay trace2 initialization
 + t1309: use short branch name in includeIf.onbranch test

 Further clean-up of the initialization code.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 configuration variables is introduced.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* vn/reset-deleted-ita (2019-07-26) 1 commit
 - reset: unstage empty deleted ita files

 "git reset HEAD [<pathspec>]" did not reset an empty file that was

* dl/rebase-i-keep-base (2019-08-27) 9 commits
 - rebase: teach rebase --keep-base
 - rebase tests: test linear branch topology
 - rebase: fast-forward --fork-point in more cases
 - rebase: fast-forward --onto in more cases
 - rebase: refactor can_fast_forward into goto tower
 - t3432: test for --no-ff's interaction with fast-forward
 - t3432: distinguish "noop-same" v.s. "work-same" in "same head" tests
 - t3432: test rebase fast-forward behavior
 - t3431: add rebase --fork-point tests

 "git rebase --keep-base <upstream>" tries to find the original base
 of the topic being rebased and rebase on top of that same base,
 which is useful when running the "git rebase -i" (and its limited
 variant "git rebase -x").

 The command also has learned to fast-forward in more cases where it
 can instead of replaying to recreate identical commits.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jc/format-patch-noclobber (2019-02-22) 1 commit
 - format-patch: --no-clobber refrains from overwriting output files

 "git format-patch" used to overwrite an existing patch/cover-letter
 file.  A new "--no-clobber" option stops it.

 Will discard.
