What's cooking in git.git (Feb 2020, #05; Tue, 25)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

Accumulated fixes on the 'master' front have been flushed to 'maint'
and a new maintenance release 2.25.1 has been tagged.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

* bw/remote-rename-update-config (2020-02-10) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-14 at 30b1a477de)
 + remote rename/remove: gently handle remote.pushDefault config
 + config: provide access to the current line number
 + remote rename/remove: handle branch.<name>.pushRemote config values
 + remote: clean-up config callback
 + remote: clean-up by returning early to avoid one indentation
 + pull --rebase/remote rename: document and honor single-letter abbreviations rebase types

 "git remote rename X Y" needs to adjust configuration variables
 (e.g. branch.<name>.remote) whose value used to be X to Y.
 branch.<name>.pushRemote is now also updated.

 + color.c: refactor color_output arguments

 The basic 7 colors learned the brighter counterparts
 (e.g. "brightred").


* es/doc-mentoring (2020-02-14) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-17 at e3f3e316eb)
 + MyFirstContribution: rephrase contact info
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-05 at 3b05aabbcd)

 marked as not ignored with a negative entry in the .gitignore file.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* en/t3433-rebase-stat-dirty-failure (2020-02-19) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-25 at 000d596d4c)
 + merge-recursive: fix the refresh logic in update_file_flags
 + t3433: new rebase testcase documenting a stat-dirty-like failure

 The merge-recursive machinery failed to refresh the cache entry for
 a merge result in a couple of places, resulting in an unnecessary
 merge failure, which has been fixed.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/doc-diff-parallel (2020-02-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-19 at 62b2264fca)

 + lib-log-graph: consolidate colored graph cmp logic
 + lib-log-graph: consolidate test_cmp_graph logic

 Test update.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ds/partial-clone-fixes (2020-02-22) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-25 at a26434bb7a)
 + partial-clone: avoid fetching when looking for objects

 Will merge to 'master'.


* pb/am-show-current-patch (2020-02-20) 5 commits
 - am: support --show-current-patch=diff to retrieve .git/rebase-apply/patch
 - am: support --show-current-patch=raw as a synonym for--show-current-patch
 - am: convert "resume" variable to a struct
 - parse-options: convert "command mode" to a flag
 - parse-options: add testcases for OPT_CMDMODE()

 "git am --short-current-patch" is a way to show the piece of e-mail
 for the stopped step, which is not suitable to directly feed "git
 apply" (it is designed to be a good "git am" input).  It learned a
 new option to show only the patch part.


* bc/wildcard-credential (2020-02-20) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-25 at ba3706cb90)
 + credential: allow wildcard patterns when matching config
 + credential: use the last matching username in the config
 + t0300: add tests for some additional cases
 + t1300: add test for urlmatch with multiple wildcards

 wildcard pattern to specify for which set of URLs the entry
 applies.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* es/recursive-single-branch-clone (2020-02-25) 2 commits
 - clone: pass --single-branch during --recurse-submodules
 - submodule--helper: use C99 named initializer

 "git clone --recurse-submodules --single-branch" now uses the same
 simgle-branch option when cloning the submodules.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jc/describe-misnamed-annotated-tag (2020-02-20) 1 commit
 - describe: force long format for a name based on a mislocated tag

 When "git describe C" finds an annotated tag with tagname A to be
 the best name to explain commit C, and the tag is stored in a
 "wrong" place in the refs/tags hierarchy, e.g. refs/tags/B, the
 command gave a warning message but used A (not B) to describe C.
 If C is exactly at the tag, the desribe output would be "A", but
 "git rev-parse A^0" would not be equal as "git rev-parse C^0".  The
 behaviour of the command has been changed to use the "long" form
 i.e. A-0-gOBJECTNAME, which is correctly interpreted by rev-parse.


* jk/run-command-formatfix (2020-02-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-25 at 39ad6eeb86)

* es/do-not-let-rebase-switch-to-protected-branch (2020-02-24) 2 commits
 - rebase: refuse to switch to branch already checked out elsewhere
 - t3400: make test clean up after itself

 "git rebase BASE BRANCH" rebased/updated the tip of BRANCH and
 checked it out, even when the BRANCH is checked out in a different
 worktree.  This has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* es/worktree-avoid-duplication-fix (2020-02-24) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-25 at 74c612837a)
 + worktree: don't allow "add" validation to be fooled by suffix matching
 + worktree: add utility to find worktree by pathname
 + worktree: improve find_worktree() documentation

 "git worktree add" used to get confused that the director to be

 + receive.denyCurrentBranch: respect all worktrees
 + t5509: use a bare repository for test push target
 + get_main_worktree(): allow it to be called in the Git directory

 "git push" should stop from updating a branch that is checked out
 when receive.denyCurrentBranch configuration is set, but it failed
 to pay attention to checkouts in secondary worktrees.  This has
 been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 + quote: use isalnum() to check for alphanumeric characters

 Code cleanup.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* be/describe-multiroot (2020-02-25) 1 commit
 - describe: dont abort too early when searching tags

 "git describe" in a repository with multiple root commits sometimes
 gave up looking for the best tag to describe a given commit with
 too early, which has been adjusted.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* pw/advise-rebase-skip (2019-12-06) 9 commits
 - rebase -i: leave CHERRY_PICK_HEAD when there are conflicts

 - commit: use enum value for multiple cherry-picks
 - sequencer: write CHERRY_PICK_HEAD for reword and edit
 - cherry-pick: check commit error messages
 - cherry-pick: add test for `--skip` advice in `git commit`
 - t3404: use test_cmp_rev

 The mechanism to prevent "git commit" from making an empty commit
 or amending during an interrupted cherry-pick was broken during the
 rewrite of "git rebase" in C, which has been corrected.

 What's the status of this one?
 The tip two are still RFC.

* vn/reset-deleted-ita (2019-07-26) 1 commit
 - reset: unstage empty deleted ita files

 "git reset HEAD [<pathspec>]" did not reset an empty file that was
 added with the intent-to-add bit.

 Expecting a reroll.


* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2018-10-15) 1 commit
 - zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

* jk/object-filter-with-bitmap (2020-02-18) 16 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-19 at d38487e23d)
 + rev-list --count: comment on the use of count_right++
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-16 at 42425c3658)
 + pack-objects: support filters with bitmaps
 + pack-bitmap: implement BLOB_LIMIT filtering
 + pack-bitmap: implement BLOB_NONE filtering
 + bitmap: add bitmap_unset() function
 + rev-list: use bitmap filters for traversal
 + pack-bitmap: basic noop bitmap filter infrastructure
 + rev-list: allow commit-only bitmap traversals
 + t5310: factor out bitmap traversal comparison
 + rev-list: allow bitmaps when counting objects
 + rev-list: make --count work with --objects
 + rev-list: factor out bitmap-optimized routines
 + pack-bitmap: refuse to do a bitmap traversal with pathspecs
 + rev-list: fallback to non-bitmap traversal when filtering
 + pack-bitmap: fix leak of haves/wants object lists
 + pack-bitmap: factor out type iterator initialization

 The object reachability bitmap machinery and the partial cloning
 machinery were not prepared to work well together, because some
 object-filtering criteria partial clones use inherently rely on
 object traversal, but the bitmap machinery is an optimization to
 bypass that object traversal.  There however are some cases that
 they can work together, and they were taught about this case.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 + git-rebase.txt: update description of --allow-empty-message

 "git rebase" has learned to use the sequencer backend by default,
 while allowing "--am" option to go back to the traditional "am"
 backend.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 . describe: output tag's ref instead of embedded name

 When "git describe C" finds an annotated tag with tagname A to be
 the best name to explain commit C, and the tag is stored in a
 "wrong" place in the refs/tags hierarchy, e.g. refs/tags/B, the
 command gave a warning message but used A (not B) to describe C.
 If C is exactly at the tag, the desribe output would be "A", but
 "git rev-parse A^0" would not be equal as "git rev-parse C^0".  The
 behaviour of the command has been changed to use "B" to describe C
 instead.

 This is not the only possible approach for the issue, and it is
 unknown if the proposed solution is the best one.
