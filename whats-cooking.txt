What's cooking in git.git (Dec 2014, #02; Wed, 10)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* jh/empty-notes (2014-11-14) 9 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-11-18 at 9eeb338)
 + t3301: modernize style
 + notes: empty notes should be shown by 'git log'
 + builtin/notes: add --allow-empty, to allow storing empty notes
 + builtin/notes: split create_note() to clarify add vs. remove logic
 + builtin/notes: simplify early exit code in add()
 + builtin/notes: refactor note file path into struct note_data
 + builtin/notes: improve naming
 + t3301: verify that 'git notes' removes empty notes by default
 + builtin/notes: fix premature failure when trying to add the empty blob

 A request to store an empty note via "git notes" meant to remove
 note from the object but with --allow-empty we will store a (surprise!)
 note that is empty.  In the longer run, we might want to deprecate
 the somewhat unintuitive "emptying means deletion" behaviour.


* jk/checkout-from-tree (2014-11-13) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-11-14 at ddbffb0)
 + checkout $tree: do not throw away unchanged index entries

 "git checkout $treeish $path", when $path in the index and the
 working tree already matched what is in $treeish at the $path,
 still overwrote the $path unnecessarily.


* jk/gitweb-with-newer-cgi-multi-param (2014-11-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-11-18 at 6ac61fe)
 + gitweb: hack around CGI's list-context param() handling

 "gitweb" used to depend on a behaviour recent CGI.pm deprecated.


* js/windows-open-eisdir-error (2014-11-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-11-18 at 57b0d49)
 + Windows: correct detection of EISDIR in mingw_open()

 open() emulated on Windows platforms did not give EISDIR upon an
 attempt to open a directory for writing.


* mh/config-flip-xbit-back-after-checking (2014-11-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-11-18 at 45f7d71)
 + create_default_files(): don't set u+x bit on $GIT_DIR/config
 (this branch is used by tb/config-core-filemode-check-on-broken-fs.)

 "git init" (hence "git clone") initialized the per-repository
 configuration file .git/config with x-bit by mistake.


* rs/env-array-in-child-process (2014-11-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-11-14 at 3f6ba07)
 + use args member of struct child_process

 Code cleanup.


* rs/maint-config-use-labs (2014-11-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-11-18 at 53c2404)
 + use labs() for variables of type long instead of abs()

 A few code paths used abs() when they should have used labs() on
 long integers.


* rs/receive-pack-use-labs (2014-11-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-11-18 at c6d2d94)
 + use labs() for variables of type long instead of abs()

 A few code paths used abs() when they should have used labs() on
 long integers.


* sv/get-builtin (2014-11-13) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-11-14 at 9497e17)
 + builtin: move builtin retrieval to get_builtin()

 Small code consolidation.


* tq/git-ssh-command (2014-11-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-11-14 at 83f5dae)
 + git_connect: set ssh shell command in GIT_SSH_COMMAND

 Allow passing extra set of arguments when ssh is invoked to create
 an encrypted & authenticated connection, which is not possible with
 existing GIT_SSH mechanism, which was designed more to match what
 other programs with similar variables did, not necessarily to be
 more useful.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* dm/compat-s-ifmt-for-zos (2014-12-04) 1 commit
 - compat: convert modes to use portable file type values

 Long overdue departure from the assumption that S_IFMT is shared by
 everybody made in 2005.


* jk/credential-quit (2014-12-04) 2 commits
 - prompt: respect GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT to disable terminal prompts
 - credential: let helpers tell us to quit

 Credential helpers are asked in turn until one of them give
 positive response, which is cumbersome to turn off when you need to
 run Git in an automated setting.  The credential helper interface
 learned to allow a helper to say "stop, don't ask other helpers."
 Also GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT environment can be set to false to disable
 our built-in prompt mechanism for passwords.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* mg/branch-d-m-f (2014-12-09) 2 commits
 - branch: allow -f with -m and -d
 - t3200-branch: test -M

 "git branch -d" (delete) and "git branch -m" (move) learned to
 honor "-f" (force) flag; unlike many other subcommands, the way to
 force these have been with separate "-D/-M" options, which was
 inconsistent.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* mg/doc-check-ignore-tracked-are-not-ignored (2014-12-04) 1 commit
 - check-ignore: clarify treatment of tracked files

 Will merge to 'next'.


* rt/completion-tag (2014-12-04) 1 commit
 - completion: add git-tag options

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/for-each-reflog-ent-reverse (2014-12-05) 2 commits
 - for_each_reflog_ent_reverse: turn leftover check into assertion
 - for_each_reflog_ent_reverse: fix newlines on block boundaries

 Will merge to 'next'.


* po/doc-assume-unchanged (2014-12-09) 2 commits
 - gitignore.txt: do not suggest assume-unchanged
 - doc: make clear --assume-unchanged's user contract

 Fixes long-standing misunderstanding of what assume-unchanged is
 about.  Some text near what is removed by the bottom patch may also
 have to be removed.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* tb/t0027-eol-conversion (2014-12-05) 1 commit
 - t0027: check the eol conversion warnings

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/always-allow-large-packets (2014-12-10) 1 commit
 - pkt-line: allow writing of LARGE_PACKET_MAX buffers

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/commit-date-approxidate (2014-12-10) 2 commits
 - commit: always populate GIT_AUTHOR_* variables
 - commit: loosen ident checks when generating template

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/read-packed-refs-without-path-max (2014-12-10) 3 commits
 - read_packed_refs: use skip_prefix instead of static array
 - read_packed_refs: pass strbuf to parse_ref_line
 - read_packed_refs: use a strbuf for reading lines

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jn/dedup-doc-header (2014-12-09) 2 commits
 - put string-list API documentation in one place
 - put strbuf API documentation in one place

 We would want to have an easy way for developers to learn about
 APIs, and also a way to encourage them to keep the API
 documentation up to date when they make changes.  Having header
 comments and API documentation duplicated in two different places
 risked them going out of sync.

 This removes the duplicates by dropping comments from the header;
 it is just for discussion at this moment.


* jn/doc-api-errors (2014-12-04) 1 commit
 - doc: document error handling functions and conventions

 For discussion.


* js/fsck-tag-validation (2014-12-09) 2 commits
 - index-pack: terminate object buffers with NUL
 - fsck: properly bound "invalid tag name" error message

 Follow-up to tag object format validation added in 2.2.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* js/test-hashmap-squelch-gcc (2014-12-09) 1 commit
 - test-hashmap: squelch gcc compiler warning

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ok/rebase-i-count-todo (2014-12-10) 1 commit
 - Show number of TODO items for interactive rebase

 Will merge to 'next'.


* rw/apply-does-not-take-ignore-date (2014-12-09) 1 commit
 - git-am.txt: --ignore-date flag is not passed to git-apply


 Will merge to 'next'.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* ms/submodule-update-config-doc (2014-11-03) 1 commit
 - submodule: clarify documentation for update subcommand

 Needs a reroll ($gmane/259037).


* je/quiltimport-no-fuzz (2014-10-21) 2 commits
 - git-quiltimport: flip the default not to allow fuzz
 - git-quiltimport.sh: allow declining fuzz with --exact option

 "quiltimport" drove "git apply" always with -C1 option to reduce
 context of the patch in order to give more chance to somewhat stale
 patches to apply.  Add an "--exact" option to disable, and also
 "-C$n" option to customize this behaviour.  The top patch
 optionally flips the default to "--exact".

 Tired of waiting for an Ack; will discard.


* jc/push-cert-hmac-optim (2014-09-25) 2 commits
 - receive-pack: truncate hmac early and convert only necessary bytes
 - sha1_to_hex: split out "hex-format n bytes" helper and use it

 This is "we could do this if we wanted to", not "we measured and it
 improves performance critical codepath".

 Will perhaps drop.


* mt/patch-id-stable (2014-06-10) 1 commit
 - patch-id: change default to stable

 Teaches "git patch-id" to compute the patch ID that does not change
 when the files in a single patch is reordered. As this new algorithm
 is backward incompatible, the last bit to flip it to be the default
 is left out of 'master' for now.

 Nobody seems to be jumping up & down requesting this last step,
 which makes the result somewhat backward incompatible.
 Will perhaps drop.


* tr/remerge-diff (2014-11-10) 9 commits
 - t4213: avoid "|" in sed regexp
 - log --remerge-diff: show what the conflict resolution changed
 - name-hash: allow dir hashing even when !ignore_case
 - merge-recursive: allow storing conflict hunks in index
 - merge_diff_mode: fold all merge diff variants into an enum
 - combine-diff: do not pass revs->dense_combined_merges redundantly
 - merge-recursive: -Xindex-only to leave worktree unchanged
 - merge-recursive: internal flag to avoid touching the worktree
 - merge-recursive: remove dead conditional in update_stages()

 "log -p" output learns a new way to let users inspect a merge
 commit by showing the differences between the automerged result
 with conflicts the person who recorded the merge would have seen
 and the final conflict resolution that was recorded in the merge.

 Waiting for a reroll ($gmane/256591).


* hv/submodule-config (2014-11-11) 4 commits
 - do not die on error of parsing fetchrecursesubmodules option
 - use new config API for worktree configurations of submodules
 - extract functions for submodule config set and lookup
 - implement submodule config cache for lookup of submodule names

 Kicked back to 'pu' per request ($gmane/255610).


* ab/add-interactive-show-diff-func-name (2014-05-12) 2 commits
 - SQUASH??? git-add--interactive: Preserve diff heading when splitting hunks
 - git-add--interactive: Preserve diff heading when splitting hunks

 Waiting for a reroll.


* jn/gitweb-utf8-in-links (2014-05-27) 1 commit
 - gitweb: Harden UTF-8 handling in generated links

 $gmane/250758?


* ss/userdiff-update-csharp-java (2014-06-02) 2 commits
 - userdiff: support Java try keyword
 - userdiff: support C# async methods and correct C# keywords

 Reviews sent; waiting for a response.


* bg/rebase-off-of-previous-branch (2014-04-16) 1 commit
 - git-rebase: print name of rev when using shorthand

 Teach "git rebase -" to report the concrete name of the branch
 (i.e. the previous one).

 But it stops short and does not do the same for "git rebase @{-1}".
 Expecting a reroll.


* rb/merge-prepare-commit-msg-hook (2014-01-10) 4 commits
 - merge: drop unused arg from abort_commit method signature
 - merge: make prepare_to_commit responsible for write_merge_state
 - t7505: ensure cleanup after hook blocks merge
 - t7505: add missing &&

 Expose more merge states (e.g. $GIT_DIR/MERGE_MODE) to hooks that
 run during "git merge".  The log message stresses too much on one
 hook, prepare-commit-msg, but it would equally apply to other hooks
 like post-merge, I think.

 Waiting for a reroll.


* jc/graph-post-root-gap (2013-12-30) 3 commits
 - WIP: document what we want at the end
 - graph: remove unused code a bit
 - graph: stuff the current commit into graph->columns[]

 This was primarily a RFH ($gmane/239580).


* tg/perf-lib-test-perf-cleanup (2013-09-19) 2 commits
 - perf-lib: add test_perf_cleanup target
 - perf-lib: split starting the test from the execution

 Add test_perf_cleanup shell function to the perf suite, that allows
 the script writers to define a test with a clean-up action.

 Will hold.


* jc/show-branch (2014-03-24) 5 commits
 - show-branch: use commit slab to represent bitflags of arbitrary width
 - show-branch.c: remove "all_mask"
 - show-branch.c: abstract out "flags" operation
 - show-branch.c: lift all_mask/all_revs to a global static
 - show-branch.c: update comment style

 Waiting for the final step to lift the hard-limit before sending it out.

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* jc/exec-cmd-system-path-leak-fix (2014-11-30) 1 commit
 - system_path(): always return free'able memory to the caller

 The function sometimes returned a non-freeable memory and some
 other times returned a piece of memory that must be freed.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jc/hook-cleanup (2014-12-01) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-12-04 at 17059f5)
 + run-command.c: retire unused run_hook_with_custom_index()

 Remove unused code.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/push-simple (2014-11-30) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-12-04 at 00785c7)
 + push: truly use "simple" as default, not "upstream"

 Git 2.0 was supposed to make the "simple" mode for the default of
 "git push", but it didn't.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jn/rerere-fail-on-auto-update-failure (2014-12-03) 2 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - rerere: error out on autoupdate failure

 Will be rerolled as a part of a larger series.


* js/push-to-deploy (2014-11-30) 2 commits
 - t5516: more tests for receive.denyCurrentBranch=updateInstead
 - receive-pack: add another option for receive.denyCurrentBranch
 (this branch is used by jc/push-to-checkout.)

 "git push" into a repository with a working tree normally refuses
 to modify the branch that is checked out.  The command learned to
 optionally do an equivalent of "git reset --hard" only when there
 is no change to the working tree and the index instead, which would
 be useful to "deploy" by pushing into a repository.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jc/push-to-checkout (2014-12-01) 2 commits
 - receive-pack: support push-to-checkout hook
 - receive-pack: refactor updateInstead codepath
 (this branch uses js/push-to-deploy.)

 Extending the js/push-to-deploy topic, the behaviour of "git push"
 when updating the working tree and the index with an update to the
 branch that is checked out can be tweaked by push-to-checkout hook.

 Needs docs.


* lh/send-email-hide-x-mailer (2014-12-04) 4 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - test/send-email: --[no-]xmailer tests
 - SQUASH???
 - send-email: add --[no-]xmailer option

 "git send-email" normally identifies itself via X-Mailer: header
 in the message it sends out.  A new command line flag allows the
 header to be squelched.


* nd/list-files (2014-12-01) 19 commits
 - list-files: -M aka diff-cached
 - list-files -F: show submodules with the new indicator '&'
 - list-files: add -F/--classify
 - list-files: show directories as well as files
 - list-files: do not show duplicate cached entries
 - list-files: sort output and remove duplicates
 - list-files: add -t back
 - list-files: add -1 short for --no-column
 - list-files: add -R/--recursive short for --max-depth=-1
 - list-files: -u does not imply showing stages
 - list-files: a user friendly version of ls-files and more
 - ls-files: support --max-depth
 - ls-files: add --column
 - ls-files: add --color to highlight file names
 - ls-files: buffer full item in strbuf before printing
 - ls_colors.c: highlight submodules like directories
 - ls_colors.c: add a function to color a file name
 - ls_colors.c: parse color.ls.* from config file
 - ls_colors.c: add $LS_COLORS parsing code

 A new "git list-files" Porcelain command, "ls-files" with bells and
 whistles.


* nd/ls-tree-pathspec (2014-12-01) 5 commits
 - t3102: style modernization
 - t3102: document that ls-tree does not yet support negated pathspec
 - ls-tree: disable negative pathspec because it's not supported
 - ls-tree: remove path filtering logic in show_tree
 - tree.c: update read_tree_recursive callback to pass strbuf as base

 "git ls-tree" does not support path selection based on negative
 pathspecs, but did not error out when negative pathspecs are given.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* rj/t0050-passes (2014-11-30) 1 commit
 - t0050-*.sh: mark the rename (case change) test as passing

 Will merge to 'next'.


* rt/for-each-ref-spell-tcl-as-Tcl (2014-11-30) 1 commit
 - for-each-ref: correct spelling of Tcl in option description

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sb/ref-transaction-reflog (2014-12-03) 2 commits
 - refs.c: rename transaction.updates to transaction.ref_updates
 - refs.c: rename the transaction functions
 (this branch uses sb/ref-transaction-unify-to-update.)

 Will be rerolled as a part of a larger series.


* ye/http-accept-language (2014-12-03) 2 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - http: send Accept-Language header if possible

 Breaks various people ($gmane/260903).


* jk/pack-bitmap (2014-11-30) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-12-04 at eb457ad)
 + pack-bitmap: do not use gcc packed attribute

 Will merge to 'master'.

 - path.c: make get_pathname() call sites return const char *
 - path.c: make get_pathname() return strbuf instead of static buffer

 A replacement for contrib/workdir/git-new-workdir that does not
 rely on symbolic links and make sharing of objects and refs safer
 by making the borrowee and borrowers aware of each other.


* jc/unpack-trees-plug-leak (2014-11-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-12-04 at 9f1df30)

 + parse_color: support 24-bit RGB values
 + parse_color: refactor color storage
 + Merge branch 'jn/parse-config-slot' into jk/colors
 (this branch uses jk/colors-fix.)

 "diff-highlight" filter (in contrib/) allows its color output
 to be customized via configuration variables.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/colors-fix (2014-11-20) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-12-04 at 0d97d69)

  (merged to 'next' on 2014-12-04 at f166620)
 + t960[34]: mark cvsimport tests as requiring perl
 + t0090: mark add-interactive test with PERL prerequisite

 Some tests that depend on perl lacked PERL prerequisite to protect
 them, breaking build with NO_PERL configuration.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/rebuild-perl-scripts-with-no-perl-seting-change (2014-11-18) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-12-04 at 27382d3)
 + Makefile: have python scripts depend on NO_PYTHON setting
 + Makefile: simplify by using SCRIPT_{PERL,SH}_GEN macros
 + Makefile: have perl scripts depend on NO_PERL setting

 The build procedure did not bother fixing perl and python scripts
 when NO_PERL and NO_PYTHON build-time configuration changed.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 (this branch is used by sb/ref-transaction-reflog.)

 Code simplification.

 Will be rerolled as a part of a larger series.

  (merged to 'next' on 2014-11-14 at 3c11a1b)
 + approxidate: allow ISO-like dates far in the future
 + pass TIME_DATE_NOW to approxidate future-check

 Traditionally we tried to avoid interpreting date strings given by
 the user as future dates, e.g. GIT_COMMITTER_DATE=2014-12-10 when
 used early November 2014 was taken as "October 12, 2014" because it
 is likely that a date in the future, December 10, is a mistake.

 Loosen this and do not tiebreak by future-ness of the date when

 (1) ISO-like format is used, and
 (2) the string can make sense interpreted as both y-m-d and y-d-m.

 The commented output used to blindly add a SP before the payload
 line, resulting in "# \t<indented text>\n" when the payload began
 with a HT.  Instead, produce "#\t<indented text>\n".
