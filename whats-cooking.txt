What's cooking in git.git (Apr 2017, #01; Tue, 11)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

The maintainer has been offline for a week or so and is still
expected to be working at a slower pace than usual for the rest of
the week.  No new topics has been queued, but the ones already in
the tree have advanced, some graduated to 'master' and others
joining 'next'.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* ab/case-insensitive-upstream-and-push-marker (2017-03-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-03-28 at 166654719e)
 + rev-parse: match @{upstream}, @{u} and @{push} case-insensitively

 On many keyboards, typing "@{" involves holding down SHIFT key and
 one can easily end up with "@{Up..." when typing "@{upstream}".  As
 the upstream/push keywords do not appear anywhere else in the syntax,
 we can safely accept them case insensitively without introducing
 ambiguity or confusion  to solve this.


* ab/doc-submitting (2017-03-26) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-03-28 at 49e23678df)
 + doc/SubmittingPatches: show how to get a CLI commit summary
 + doc/SubmittingPatches: clarify the casing convention for "area: change..."

 Doc update.


* ab/ref-filter-no-contains (2017-03-24) 16 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-03-28 at bdce986928)
 + tag: add tests for --with and --without
 + ref-filter: reflow recently changed branch/tag/for-each-ref docs
 + ref-filter: add --no-contains option to tag/branch/for-each-ref
 + tag: change --point-at to default to HEAD
 + tag: implicitly supply --list given another list-like option
 + tag: change misleading --list <pattern> documentation
 + parse-options: add OPT_NONEG to the "contains" option
 + tag: add more incompatibles mode tests
 + for-each-ref: partly change <object> to <commit> in help
 + tag tests: fix a typo in a test description
 + tag: remove a TODO item from the test suite
 + ref-filter: add test for --contains on a non-commit
 + ref-filter: make combining --merged & --no-merged an error
 + tag doc: reword --[no-]merged to talk about commits, not tips
 + tag doc: split up the --[no-]merged documentation
 + tag doc: move the description of --[no-]merged earlier

 "git tag/branch/for-each-ref" family of commands long allowed to
 filter the refs by "--contains X" (show only the refs that are
 descendants of X), "--merged X" (show only the refs that are
 ancestors of X), "--no-merged X" (show only the refs that are not
 ancestors of X).  One curious omission, "--no-contains X" (show
 only the refs that are not descendants of X) has been added to
 them.


* ab/test-readme-updates (2017-03-26) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-03-28 at abdc7b3b15)
 + t/README: clarify the test_have_prereq documentation
 + t/README: change "Inside <X> part" to "Inside the <X> part"
 + t/README: link to metacpan.org, not search.cpan.org

 Doc updates.


* ah/log-decorate-default-to-auto (2017-03-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-03-24 at ce353ebfb5)
 + log: if --decorate is not given, default to --decorate=auto

 The default behaviour of "git log" in an interactive session has
 been changed to enable "--decorate".


* bc/push-cert-receive-fix (2017-03-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-03-30 at 4f49b383e2)
 + builtin/receive-pack: fix incorrect pointer arithmetic

 "git receive-pack" could have been forced to die by attempting
 allocate an unreasonably large amount of memory with a crafted push
 certificate; this has been fixed.


* bw/recurse-submodules-relative-fix (2017-03-17) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-03-28 at d0cef6234e)
 + ls-files: fix bug when recursing with relative pathspec
 + ls-files: fix typo in variable name
 + grep: fix bug when recursing with relative pathspec
 + setup: allow for prefix to be passed to git commands
 + grep: fix help text typo

 A few commands that recently learned the "--recurse-submodule"
 option misbehaved when started from a subdirectory of the
 superproject.


* bw/submodule-is-active (2017-03-18) 10 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-03-22 at 4c05cb5ab4)
 + submodule add: respect submodule.active and submodule.<name>.active
 + submodule--helper init: set submodule.<name>.active
 + clone: teach --recurse-submodules to optionally take a pathspec
 + submodule init: initialize active submodules
 + submodule: decouple url and submodule interest
 + submodule--helper clone: check for configured submodules using helper
 + submodule sync: use submodule--helper is-active
 + submodule sync: skip work for inactive submodules
 + submodule status: use submodule--helper is-active
 + submodule--helper: add is-active subcommand

 "what URL do we want to update this submodule?" and "are we
 interested in this submodule?" are split into two distinct
 concepts, and then the way used to express the latter got extended,
 paving a way to make it easier to manage a project with many
 submodules and make it possible to later extend use of multiple
 worktrees for a project with submodules.


* cc/untracked (2017-03-30) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-03-30 at 0b20d47950)
 + update-index: fix xgetcwd() related memory leak

 Code cleanup.


* jc/merge-drop-old-syntax (2015-04-29) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-02-27 at 2c0f5f73d8)
 + merge: drop 'git merge <message> HEAD <commit>' syntax

 Stop supporting "git merge <message> HEAD <commit>" syntax that has
 been deprecated since October 2007, and issues a deprecation
 warning message since v2.5.0.


* jk/make-coccicheck-detect-errors (2017-03-29) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-03-30 at 34d4fe70dc)
 + Makefile: detect errors in running spatch

 Build fix.


* jk/no-looking-at-dotgit-outside-repo-final (2016-10-26) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-02-27 at 7373a1b73d)
 + setup_git_env: avoid blind fall-back to ".git"

 This is the endgame of the topic to avoid blindly falling back to
 ".git" when the setup sequence said we are _not_ in Git repository.
 A corner case that happens to work right now may be broken by a
 call to die("BUG").


* js/rebase-i-reword-to-run-hooks (2017-03-27) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-03-28 at d23d60f63d)
 + sequencer: allow the commit-msg hooks to run during a `reword`
 + sequencer: make commit options more extensible
 + t7504: document regression: reword no longer calls commit-msg

 A recent update to "rebase -i" stopped running hooks for the "git
 commit" command during "reword" action, which has been fixed.


* ls/travis-relays-for-windows-ci (2017-03-28) 1 commit
 - travis-ci: build and test Git on Windows

 Define a new task in .travis.yml that triggers a test session on
 Windows run elsewhere.


* mg/describe-debug-l10n (2017-03-27) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-03-28 at 16ad604828)
 + l10n: de: translate describe debug terms
 + describe: localize debug output fully
 (this branch is used by mg/name-rev-debug.)

 Some debugging output from "git describe" were marked for l10n,
 but some weren't.  Mark missing ones for l10n.


* mh/notes-tree-consolidate-fix (2017-03-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-03-30 at 8383c6c088)
 + notes: do not break note_tree structure in note_tree_consolidate()

 Removing an entry from a notes tree and then looking another note
 entry from the resulting tree using the internal notes API
 functions did not work as expected.  No in-tree users of the API
 has such access pattern, but it still is worth fixing.


* rs/freebsd-getcwd-workaround (2017-03-26) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-03-28 at 3f3c1553a7)
 + strbuf: support long paths w/o read rights in strbuf_getcwd() on FreeBSD

 FreeBSD implementation of getcwd(3) behaved differently when an
 intermediate directory is unreadable/unsearchable depending on the
 length of the buffer provided, which our strbuf_getcwd() was not
 aware of.  strbuf_getcwd() has been taught to cope with it better.


* sg/completion-ctags (2017-03-23) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-03-27 at cf8c081f7d)
 + completion: offer ctags symbol names for 'git log -S', '-G' and '-L:'
 + completion: extract completing ctags symbol names into helper function
 + completion: put matching ctags symbol names directly into COMPREPLY
 (this branch uses sg/completion-refs-speedup.)

 Command line completion updates.


* sg/completion-refs-speedup (2017-03-23) 14 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-03-27 at 6bb275710d)
 + completion: speed up branch and tag completion
 + completion: fill COMPREPLY directly when completing fetch refspecs
 + completion: fill COMPREPLY directly when completing refs
 + completion: let 'for-each-ref' sort remote branches for 'checkout' DWIMery
 + completion: let 'for-each-ref' filter remote branches for 'checkout' DWIMery
 + completion: let 'for-each-ref' strip the remote name from remote branches
 + completion: let 'for-each-ref' and 'ls-remote' filter matching refs
 + completion: don't disambiguate short refs
 + completion: don't disambiguate tags and branches
 + completion: support excluding full refs
 + completion: support completing fully qualified non-fast-forward refspecs
 + completion: support completing full refs after '--option=refs/<TAB>'
 + completion: wrap __git_refs() for better option parsing
 + completion: remove redundant __gitcomp_nl() options from _git_commit()
 (this branch is used by sg/completion-ctags.)

 The refs completion for large number of refs has been sped up,
 partly by giving up disambiguating ambiguous refs and partly by
 eliminating most of the shell processing between 'git for-each-ref'
 and 'ls-remote' and Bash's completion facility.

 the indented line was mistook as a continuation of the in-body
 header.  This has been fixed.

* sh/grep-tree-obj-tweak-output (2017-01-20) 2 commits
 - grep: use '/' delimiter for paths
 - grep: only add delimiter if there isn't one already

 "git grep", when fed a tree-ish as an input, shows each hit
 prefixed with "<tree-ish>:<path>:<lineno>:".  As <tree-ish> is
 almost always either a commit or a tag that points at a commit, the
 early part of the output "<tree-ish>:<path>" can be used as the
 name of the blob and given to "git show".  When <tree-ish> is a
 tree given in the extended SHA-1 syntax (e.g. "<commit>:", or
 "<commit>:<dir>"), however, this results in a string that does not
 name a blob (e.g. "<commit>::<path>" or "<commit>:<dir>:<path>").
 "git grep" has been taught to be a bit more intelligent about these
 cases and omit a colon (in the former case) or use slash (in the
 latter case) to produce "<commit>:<path>" and
 "<commit>:<dir>/<path>" that can be used as the name of a blob.

 Expecting a reroll?  Is this good enough with known limitations?


* jc/diff-b-m (2015-02-23) 5 commits
 . WIPWIP
 . WIP: diff-b-m
 - diffcore-rename: allow easier debugging
 - diffcore-rename.c: add locate_rename_src()
 - diffcore-break: allow debugging

 "git diff -B -M" produced incorrect patch when the postimage of a
 completely rewritten file is similar to the preimage of a removed
 file; such a resulting file must not be expressed as a rename from
 other place.

 The fix in this patch is broken, unfortunately.

 Will discard.

* bp/sub-process-convert-filter (2017-03-30) 8 commits
 - convert: update subprocess_read_status to not die on EOF
 - sub-process: move sub-process functions into separate files
 - convert: rename reusable sub-process functions
 - convert: update generic functions to only use generic data structures
 - convert: separate generic structures and variables from the filter specific ones
 - convert: split start_multi_file_filter() into two separate functions
 - convert: move packet_write_list() into pkt-line.c as packet_writel()

 Code from "conversion using external process" codepath has been
 extracted to a separate sub-process.[ch] module.

 This looks ready for 'next'.  Any more comments?


* cc/split-index-config (2017-03-30) 1 commit
 - read-cache: avoid using git_path() in freshen_shared_index()

 The split-index code configuration code used an unsafe git_path()

 - name-rev: favor describing with tags and use committer date to tiebreak
 - name-rev: refactor logic to see if a new candidate is a better name

 "git describe --debug --contains" did not add any meaningful
 information, even though without "--contains" it did.

* sb/submodule-short-status (2017-03-29) 7 commits
 - submodule.c: correctly handle nested submodules in is_submodule_modified
 - short status: improve reporting for submodule changes
 - submodule.c: stricter checking for submodules in is_submodule_modified
 - submodule.c: port is_submodule_modified to use porcelain 2
 - submodule.c: convert is_submodule_modified to use strbuf_getwholeline
 - submodule.c: factor out early loop termination in is_submodule_modified
 - submodule.c: use argv_array in is_submodule_modified

 The output from "git status --short" has been extended to show
 various kinds of dirtyness in submodules differently; instead of to
 "M" for modified, 'm' and '?' can be shown to signal changes only
 to the working tree of the submodule but not the commit that is
 checked out.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 - ref-cache: use a callback function to fill the cache
 - refs: record the ref_store in ref_cache, not ref_dir
 - ref-cache: introduce a new type, ref_cache

 (this branch uses nd/files-backend-git-dir; is tangled with nd/prune-in-worktree and nd/worktree-kill-parse-ref.)

 The internals of the refs API around the cached refs has been
 streamlined.

 Waiting for nd/files-backend-git-dir to settle.


* ja/doc-l10n (2017-03-20) 3 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - l10n: add git-add.txt to localized man pages
 - l10n: introduce framework for localizing man pages

 A proposal to use po4a to localize our manual pages.


* nd/prune-in-worktree (2017-03-27) 12 commits
 - rev-list: expose and document --single-worktree
 - revision.c: --reflog add HEAD reflog from all worktrees
 - files-backend: make reflog iterator go through per-worktree reflog
 - revision.c: --all adds HEAD from all worktrees
 - refs: remove dead for_each_*_submodule()
 - revision.c: use refs_for_each*() instead of for_each_*_submodule()
 - refs: add refs_head_ref()
 - refs: move submodule slash stripping code to get_submodule_ref_store
 - refs.c: refactor get_submodule_ref_store(), share common free block
 - revision.c: --indexed-objects add objects from all worktrees
 - revision.c: refactor add_index_objects_to_pending()
 - revision.h: new flag in struct rev_info wrt. worktree-related refs
 (this branch uses nd/files-backend-git-dir and nd/worktree-kill-parse-ref; is tangled with mh/separate-ref-cache.)

 "git gc" and friends when multiple worktrees are used off of a
 single repository did not consider the index and per-worktree refs
 of other worktrees as the root for reachability traversal, making
 objects that are in use only in other worktrees to be subject to
 garbage collection.

 Waiting for nd/files-backend-git-dir to settle.


* nd/worktree-kill-parse-ref (2017-03-27) 4 commits
 - refs: kill set_worktree_head_symref()
 - worktree.c: kill parse_ref() in favor of refs_resolve_ref_unsafe()
 - refs: introduce get_worktree_ref_store()
 - environment.c: fix potential segfault by get_git_common_dir()
 (this branch is used by nd/prune-in-worktree; uses nd/files-backend-git-dir; is tangled with mh/separate-ref-cache.)

 (hopefully) a beginning of safer "git worktree" that is resistant
 to "gc".

 Waiting for nd/files-backend-git-dir to settle.

 - t1405: some basic tests on main ref store
 - t/helper: add test-ref-store to test ref-store functions

 - refs.h: add forward declaration for structs used in this file
 (this branch is used by mh/separate-ref-cache, nd/prune-in-worktree and nd/worktree-kill-parse-ref.)

 The "submodule" specific field in the ref_store structure is
 replaced with a more generic "gitdir" that can later be used also
 when dealing with ref_store that represents the set of refs visible
 from the other worktrees.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jc/p4-current-branch-fix (2017-03-27) 2 commits
 - DONTMERGE git-p4: "name-rev HEAD" is not a way to find the current branch
 - git-p4: add failing test for name-rev rather than symbolic-ref

 "git p4" used "name-rev HEAD" when it wants to learn what branch is
 checked out; it should use "symbolic-ref HEAD".

 The tip one (i.e. real fix) needs to be redone by somebody
 competent with Python and git-p4 codebase.


* jc/bundle (2016-03-03) 6 commits
 - index-pack: --clone-bundle option
 - Merge branch 'jc/index-pack' into jc/bundle
 - bundle v3: the beginning
 - bundle: keep a copy of bundle file name in the in-core bundle header
 - bundle: plug resource leak
 - bundle doc: 'verify' is not about verifying the bundle

 The beginning of "split bundle", which could be one of the
 ingredients to allow "git clone" traffic off of the core server
 network to CDN.

* jc/name-rev (2017-03-16) 2 commits
 . name-rev: favor describing with tags and use committer date to tiebreak
 . name-rev: refactor logic to see if a new candidate is a better name

 "git name-rev" penalized lightweight tags too much, making them
 almost useless especially when the command is run with "--tags".
 Give the same precedence to lightweight tags as annotated tags as
 the base for naming a commit.

 Now part of mg/name-rev-debug topic.
