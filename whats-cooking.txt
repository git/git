What's cooking in git.git (Nov 2025, #06; Wed, 19)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and
aren't considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL
to a message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity (of course they can be resubmit when new interests
arise).

The 'master' branch now has the first batch of topics for the new
cycle.  The tip of 'next' branch has been rewound.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-scm/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/

 + diff: disable rename detection with --quiet

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2025-11-14

 As "git diff --quiet" only cares about the existence of any
 changes, disable rename/copy detection to skip more expensive
 processing whose result will be discarded anyway.

* sa/replay-atomic-ref-updates (2025-11-05) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2025-11-19 at ae19b06a22)
 + replay: add replay.refAction config option
 + replay: make atomic ref updates the default behavior
 + replay: use die_for_incompatible_opt2() for option validation
 (this branch is used by ps/history.)

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2025-11-18

 "git replay" (experimental) learned to perform ref updates itself
 in a transaction by default, instead of emitting where each refs
 should point at and leaving the actual update to another command.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 each other by encoding submodule names before using them as path
 components.
