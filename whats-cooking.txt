What's cooking in git.git (Jul 2017, #04; Thu, 13)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

A maintenance release for 2.13.x series, and the first preview for
2.14 series -rc0, have been tagged.  Let's close the 'master' except
for obvious fixes and clean-ups and concentrate on regressions from
now on.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

[Graduated to "master"]

* ab/grep-lose-opt-regflags (2017-06-30) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-05 at 375c0b92ea)
 + grep: remove redundant REG_NEWLINE when compiling fixed regex
 + grep: remove regflags from the public grep_opt API
 + grep: remove redundant and verbose re-assignments to 0
 + grep: remove redundant "fixed" field re-assignment to 0
 + grep: adjust a redundant grep pattern type assignment
 + grep: remove redundant double assignment to 0

 Code cleanup.


* jk/build-with-asan (2017-07-10) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-10 at 49757e1119)
 + Makefile: disable unaligned loads with UBSan
 + Makefile: turn off -fomit-frame-pointer with sanitizers
 + Makefile: add helper for compiling with -fsanitize
 + test-lib: turn on ASan abort_on_error by default
 + test-lib: set ASAN_OPTIONS variable before we run git

 The build procedure has been improved to allow building and testing
 Git with address sanitizer more easily.


* kn/ref-filter-branch-list (2017-07-10) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-10 at 35fd25c0dd)
 + ref-filter.c: drop return from void function
 + branch: set remote color in ref-filter branch immediately
 + branch: use BRANCH_COLOR_LOCAL in ref-filter format
 + branch: only perform HEAD check for local branches

 The rewrite of "git branch --list" using for-each-ref's internals
 that happened in v2.13 regressed its handling of color.branch.local;
 this has been fixed.


* ks/fix-rebase-doc-picture (2017-07-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-10 at 3acb856b17)
 + doc: correct a mistake in an illustration

 Doc update.


* rs/apply-avoid-over-reading (2017-07-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-10 at 2d8191ec3f)
 + apply: use strcmp(3) for comparing strings in gitdiff_verify_name()

 Code cleanup.

  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-10 at 2dd3e7cab0)
 + urlmatch: use hex2chr() in append_normalized_escapes()

 Code cleanup.


* rs/use-div-round-up (2017-07-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-10 at accb7919da)
 + use DIV_ROUND_UP

 Code cleanup.


* rs/wt-status-cleanup (2017-07-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-10 at d8939f683a)
 + wt-status: use separate variable for result of shorten_unambiguous_ref

 Code cleanup.


* sb/hashmap-customize-comparison (2017-06-30) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-06 at cc420805f3)
 + hashmap: migrate documentation from Documentation/technical into header
 + patch-ids.c: use hashmap correctly
 + hashmap.h: compare function has access to a data field
 (this branch is used by sb/diff-color-move and sb/hashmap-cleanup.)

 Update the hashmap API so that data to customize the behaviour of
 the comparison function can be specified at the time a hashmap is
 initialized.


* sb/pull-rebase-submodule (2017-06-27) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-09 at 48d2c3a51c)
 + builtin/fetch cleanup: always set default value for submodule recursing
 + pull: optionally rebase submodules (remote submodule changes only)
 + builtin/fetch: parse recurse-submodules-default at default options parsing
 + builtin/fetch: factor submodule recurse parsing out to submodule config

 "git pull --rebase --recurse-submodules" learns to rebase the
 branch in the submodules to an updated base.


* sb/submodule-doc (2017-06-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-09 at fda0ceec31)
 + submodules: overhaul documentation

 Doc update.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* jn/hooks-pre-rebase-sample-fix (2017-07-11) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-12 at ed86887454)
 + pre-rebase hook: capture documentation in a <<here document

 Code clean-up, that makes us in sync with Debian by one patch.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/gc-pre-detach-under-hook (2017-07-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-12 at 9cf44c2b07)
 + gc: run pre-detach operations under lock

 We run an early part of "git gc" that deals with refs before
 daemonising (and not under lock) even when running a background
 auto-gc, which caused multiple gc processes attempting to run the
 early part at the same time.  This is now prevented by running the
 early part also under the GC lock.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/ref-filter-colors (2017-07-13) 15 commits
 - ref-filter: consult want_color() before emitting colors
 - pretty: respect color settings for %C placeholders
 - rev-list: pass diffopt->use_colors through to pretty-print
 - for-each-ref: load config earlier
 - color: check color.ui in git_default_config()
 - ref-filter: pass ref_format struct to atom parsers
 - ref-filter: factor out the parsing of sorting atoms
 - ref-filter: make parse_ref_filter_atom a private function
 - ref-filter: provide a function for parsing sort options
 - ref-filter: move need_color_reset_at_eol into ref_format
 - ref-filter: abstract ref format into its own struct
 - ref-filter: simplify automatic color reset
 - t: use test_decode_color rather than literal ANSI codes
 - docs/for-each-ref: update pointer to color syntax
 - check return value of verify_ref_format()

 "%C(color name)" in the pretty print format always produced ANSI
 color escape codes, which was an early design mistake.  They now
 honor the configuration (e.g. "color.ui = never") and also tty-ness
 of the output medium.

 Will merge to and cook in 'next'.


* sb/object-id (2017-07-13) 2 commits
 - tag: convert gpg_verify_tag to use struct object_id
 - commit: convert lookup_commit_graft to struct object_id

 Conversion from uchar[20] to struct object_id continues.

 Will merge to 'next'.

[Stalled]

* mg/status-in-progress-info (2017-05-10) 2 commits
 - status --short --inprogress: spell it as --in-progress
 - status: show in-progress info for short status

 "git status" learns an option to report various operations
 (e.g. "merging") that the user is in the middle of.

 - worktree move: refuse to move worktrees with submodules
 - worktree move: accept destination as directory
 - worktree move: new command
 - worktree.c: add update_worktree_location()
 - worktree.c: add validate_worktree()

 "git worktree" learned move and remove subcommands.

* sg/clone-refspec-from-command-line-config (2017-06-16) 2 commits
 - Documentation/clone: document ignored configuration variables
 - clone: respect additional configured fetch refspecs during initial fetch
 (this branch is used by sg/remote-no-string-refspecs.)

 "git clone -c var=val" is a way to set configuration variables in
 the resulting repository, but it is more useful to also make these
 variables take effect while the initial clone is happening,
 e.g. these configuration variables could be fetch refspecs.

 Waiting for a response.

* js/rebase-i-final (2017-06-15) 10 commits
 - rebase -i: rearrange fixup/squash lines using the rebase--helper
 - t3415: test fixup with wrapped oneline
 - rebase -i: skip unnecessary picks using the rebase--helper
 - rebase -i: check for missing commits in the rebase--helper

 - t3415: verify that an empty instructionFormat is handled as before

 The final batch to "git rebase -i" updates to move more code from
 the shell script to C.

* rs/progress-overall-throughput-at-the-end (2017-07-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-11 at f5168e975b)
 + progress: show overall rate in last update

 The progress meter did not give a useful output when we haven't had
 0.5 seconds to measure the throughput during the interval.  Instead
 show the overall throughput rate at the end, which is a much more
 useful number.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* rs/sha1-file-micro-optim (2017-07-09) 2 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - sha1_file: add slash once in for_each_file_in_obj_subdir()

 Code cleanup.

 Perhaps drop.
 cf. <f59c8256-716b-9305-2a4f-d4fe49f666ff@web.de>


* ks/prepare-commit-msg-sample (2017-07-12) 4 commits
 - hook: add a simple first example
 - hook: add sign-off using "interpret-trailers"
 - hook: name the positional variables
 - hook: cleanup script

 Remove an example that is now obsolete from a sample hook,
 and improve an old example in it that added a sign-off manually
 to use the interpret-trailers command.


* jc/allow-lazy-cas (2017-07-06) 1 commit
 - push: disable lazy --force-with-lease by default

 Because "git push --force-with-lease[=<ref>]" that relies on the
 stability of remote-tracking branches is unsafe when something
 fetches into the repository behind user's back, it is now disabled
 by default.  A new configuration variable can be used to enable it
 by users who know what they are doing.  This would pave the way to
 possibly turn `--force` into `--force-with-lease`.

 Will wait for feedback, then merge to and cook in 'next'.

 Independent from disabling the feature by default, this stirred up
 a discussion to replace the DWIM heuristics with a better one, which
 deserves to be its own topic.
 cf. <alpine.DEB.2.21.1.1707131435220.4193@virtualbox>


* bc/object-id (2017-07-04) 12 commits
 - sha1_name: convert GET_SHA1* flags to GET_OID*
 - sha1_name: convert get_sha1* to get_oid*
 - Convert remaining callers of get_sha1 to get_oid.
 - builtin/verify-tag: convert to struct object_id

* jk/reflog-walk (2017-07-09) 9 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-09 at 7449e964c6)
 + reflog-walk: apply --since/--until to reflog dates
 + reflog-walk: stop using fake parents
 + rev-list: check reflog_info before showing usage
 + get_revision_1(): replace do-while with an early return
 + log: do not free parents when walking reflog
 + log: clarify comment about reflog cycles
 + revision: disallow reflog walking with revs->limited
 + t1414: document some reflog-walk oddities
 + Merge branch 'jk/reflog-walk-maint' into jk/reflog-walk

 Numerous bugs in walking of reflogs via "log -g" and friends have
 been fixed.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* sb/hashmap-cleanup (2017-07-05) 10 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-12 at ce31d06165)
 + t/helper/test-hashmap: use custom data instead of duplicate cmp functions
 + name-hash.c: drop hashmap_cmp_fn cast
 + submodule-config.c: drop hashmap_cmp_fn cast
 + remote.c: drop hashmap_cmp_fn cast
 + patch-ids.c: drop hashmap_cmp_fn cast
 + convert/sub-process: drop cast to hashmap_cmp_fn
 + config.c: drop hashmap_cmp_fn cast
 + builtin/describe: drop hashmap_cmp_fn cast
 + builtin/difftool.c: drop hashmap_cmp_fn cast
 + attr.c: drop hashmap_cmp_fn cast

 Many uses of comparision callback function the hashmap API uses
 cast the callback function type when registering it to
 hashmap_init(), which defeats the compile time type checking when
 the callback interface changes (e.g. gaining more parameters).
 The callback implementations have been updated to take "void *"
 pointers and cast them to the type they expect instead.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* tb/push-to-cygwin-unc-path (2017-07-05) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-11 at 4d9c3f82bd)
 + cygwin: allow pushing to UNC paths

 On Cygwin, similar to Windows, "git push //server/share/repository"
 ought to mean a repository on a network share that can be accessed
 locally, but this did not work correctly due to stripping the double
 slashes at the beginning.

 This may need to be heavily tested before it gets unleashed to the
 wild, as the change is at a fairly low-level code and would affect
 not just the code to decide if the push destination is local.  There
 may be unexpected fallouts in the path normalization.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* mt/p4-parse-G-output (2017-07-13) 3 commits
 - git-p4: filter for {'code':'info'} in p4CmdList
 - git-p4: parse marshal output "p4 -G" in p4 changes
 - git-p4: git-p4 tests with p4 triggers

 Use "p4 -G" to make "p4 changes" output more Python-friendly
 to parse.

 Wait to see Travis is OK with this and merge to 'next'


* ex/deprecate-empty-pathspec-as-match-all (2017-06-23) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-06-26 at d026281517)
 + pathspec: die on empty strings as pathspec
 + t0027: do not use an empty string as a pathspec element

 The final step to make an empty string as a pathspec element
 illegal.  We started this by first deprecating and warning a
 pathspec that has such an element in 2.11 (Nov 2016).

 Hopefully we can merge this down to the 'master' by the end of the
 year?  A deprecation warning period that is about 1 year does not
 sound too bad.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* mh/packed-ref-store (2017-07-03) 30 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-05 at 6c68c603cc)
 + read_packed_refs(): die if `packed-refs` contains bogus data
 + t3210: add some tests of bogus packed-refs file contents
 + repack_without_refs(): don't lock or unlock the packed refs
 + commit_packed_refs(): remove call to `packed_refs_unlock()`
 + clear_packed_ref_cache(): don't protest if the lock is held
 + packed_refs_unlock(), packed_refs_is_locked(): new functions
 + packed_refs_lock(): report errors via a `struct strbuf *err`
 + packed_refs_lock(): function renamed from lock_packed_refs()
 + commit_packed_refs(): use a staging file separate from the lockfile
 + commit_packed_refs(): report errors rather than dying
 + packed_ref_store: make class into a subclass of `ref_store`
 + packed-backend: new module for handling packed references
 + packed_read_raw_ref(): new function, replacing `resolve_packed_ref()`
 + packed_ref_store: support iteration
 + packed_peel_ref(): new function, extracted from `files_peel_ref()`
 + repack_without_refs(): take a `packed_ref_store *` parameter

 + packed_ref_store: move `packed_refs_lock` member here
 + packed_ref_store: move `packed_refs_path` here
 + packed_ref_store: new struct
 + add_packed_ref(): teach function to overwrite existing refs
 + t1408: add a test of stale packed refs covered by loose refs

 The "ref-store" code reorganization continues.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* sd/branch-copy (2017-06-18) 3 commits
 - branch: add a --copy (-c) option to go with --move (-m)
 - branch: add test for -m renaming multiple config sections
 - config: create a function to format section headers

 "git branch" learned "-c/-C" to create and switch to a new branch
 by copying an existing one.

 Undecided.

 I personally do not think "branch --copy master backup" while on
 "master" that switches to "backup" is a good UI, and I *will* say
 "I told you so" when users complain after we merge this down to
 'next' and eventually to 'master'.


* ls/filter-process-delayed (2017-06-30) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-05 at a35e644082)
 + convert: add "status=delayed" to filter process protocol
 + convert: refactor capabilities negotiation
 + convert: move multiple file filter error handling to separate function
 + convert: put the flags field before the flag itself for consistent style
 + t0021: write "OUT <size>" only on success
 + t0021: make debug log file name configurable
 + t0021: keep filter log files on comparison

 The filter-process interface learned to allow a process with long
 latency give a "delayed" response.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* bp/fsmonitor (2017-06-12) 6 commits
 - fsmonitor: add a sample query-fsmonitor hook script for Watchman
 - fsmonitor: add documentation for the fsmonitor extension.
 - fsmonitor: add test cases for fsmonitor extension
 - fsmonitor: teach git to optionally utilize a file system monitor to speed up detecting new or changed files.
 - dir: make lookup_untracked() available outside of dir.c
 - bswap: add 64 bit endianness helper get_be64

 We learned to talk to watchman to speed up "git status".

 objects that are in use only in other worktrees to be subject to
 garbage collection.
