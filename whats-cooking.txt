What's cooking in git.git (Jul 2022, #02; Fri, 8)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen',
and aren't considered "accepted" at all.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

Release tarballs are available at:

[New Topics]

* ab/cocci-unused (2022-07-06) 6 commits
 - cocci: generalize "unused" rule to cover more than "strbuf"
 - cocci: add and apply a rule to find "unused" strbufs
 - cocci: have "coccicheck{,-pending}" depend on "coccicheck-test"
 - cocci: add a "coccicheck-test" target and test *.cocci rules
 - Makefile & .gitignore: ignore & clean "git.res", not "*.res"
 - Makefile: remove mandatory "spatch" arguments from SPATCH_FLAGS

 Add Coccinelle rules to detect the pattern of initializing and then
 finalizing a structure without using it in between at all, which
 happens after code restructuring and the compilers fail to
 recognize as an unused varilable.

* rs/archive-with-internal-gzip (2022-06-15) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2022-06-17 at ab5af6acd1)
 + archive-tar: use internal gzip by default
 + archive-tar: use OS_CODE 3 (Unix) for internal gzip
 + archive-tar: add internal gzip implementation
 + archive-tar: factor out write_block()
 + archive: rename archiver data field to filter_command
 + archive: update format documentation

 Teach "git archive" to (optionally and then by default) avoid
 spawning an external "gzip" process when creating ".tar.gz" (and
 ".tgz") archives.

  (merged to 'next' on 2022-06-21 at e42bc4566f)
 + branch: drop unused worktrees variable
 + fetch: stop passing around unused worktrees variable
  (merged to 'next' on 2022-06-17 at c881874257)
 + branch: fix branch_checked_out() leaks
 + branch: use branch_checked_out() when deleting refs
 + fetch: use new branch_checked_out() and add tests
 + branch: check for bisects and rebases
 + branch: add branch_checked_out() helper
 (this branch is used by ds/rebase-update-ref.)

 Introduce a helper to see if a branch is already being worked on
 (hence should not be newly checked out in a working tree), which
 performs much better than the existing find_shared_symref() to
 replace many uses of the latter.

* jt/connected-show-missing-from-which-side (2022-06-10) 1 commit
 - fetch,fetch-pack: clarify connectivity check error

 We may find an object missing after a "git fetch" stores the
 objects it obtained from the other side, but it is not necessarily
 because the remote failed to send necessary objects.  Reword the
 messages in an attempt to help users explore other possibilities
 when they hit this error.

 Expecting a reroll.

 . send-email: always confirm by default

 "git send-email" is changed so that by default it asks for
 confirmation before sending each message out.

 Discarded.
 I wanted to like this, and had it in the version of Git I use
 myself for daily work, but the prompting turned out to be somewhat
 distracting.
