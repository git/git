What's cooking in git.git (Oct 2024, #05; Tue, 8)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and
aren't considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL
to a message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity (of course they can be resubmit when new interests
arise).

Git 2.47 (final) has been tagged, and the 'maint' branch now points
at v2.47.0.  Let's hope we didn't introduce too many regressions
this time.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-scm/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/

Release tarballs are available at:

[New Topics]

* cw/worktree-relative (2024-10-08) 4 commits
 - worktree: add test for path handling in linked worktrees
 - worktree: link worktrees with relative paths
 - worktree: refactor infer_backlink() to use *strbuf
 - Merge branch 'es/worktree-repair-copied' into cw/worktrees-relative
 (this branch uses es/worktree-repair-copied.)

 An extra worktree attached to a repository points at each other to
 allow finding the repository from the worktree and vice versa
 possible.  Turn this linkage to relative paths.

 Commands that can also work outside Git have learned to take the
 repository instance "repo" when we know we are in a repository, and
 NULL when we are not, in a parameter.  The uses of the_repository
 variable in a few of them have been removed using the new calling
 convention.

 - version: refactor strbuf_sanitize()

 The v2 protocol learned to allow the server to advertise possible
 promisor remotes, and the client to respond with what promissor
 remotes it uses, so that the server side can omit objects that the
 client can lazily obtain from these other promissor remotes.

 contents that have always been taken valid but something Git
 wouldn't have written itself (e.g., missing terminating end-of-line
 after the full object name).

 In a repository with too many (more than --window size) similarly
 named files, "git repack" would not find good delta-base candidate
 and worse, it may not use a blob from exactly the same path as a
 good delta-base candidate.  Optionally replace the name hash so
 that only blobs at the same path and nothing else are used as
 delta-base candidate.
