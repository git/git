What's cooking in git.git (Jan 2022, #01; Mon, 3)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen',
which means nothing more than that I have found them of interest for
some reason (like "it may have hard-to-resolve conflicts with
another topic already in flight" or "this may turn out to be
useful").  Do not read too much into a topic being in (or not in)
'seen'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of the
integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

Hopefully this will be the last issue of "What's cooking" report of
this year.  Please expect my tree will be slow moving this week and
whereever you are on the globe, relax and enjoy the remainder of
this year.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

 . http-backend: give a hint that web browser access is not supported

 When the http-backend program, which is the server-side component
 for the smart HTTP transport, sends a "404 Not found" error, we
 deliberately did not say anything to the requesting client.  We now
 send a message back to the browser to tell the user that they do
 not want to visit the URL via their browser, instead of a totally
 blank page.

 "git upload-pack" (the other side of "git fetch") used a 8kB buffer
 but most of its payload came on 64kB "packets".  The buffer size
 has been enlarged so that such a packet fits.

 + unpack-trees: add special cwd handling
 + unpack-trees: refuse to remove startup_info->original_cwd
 + setup: introduce startup_info->original_cwd
 + t2501: add various tests for removing the current working directory

 Many git commands that deal with working tree files try to remove a
 directory that becomes empty (i.e. "git switch" from a branch that
 has the directory to another branch that does not would attempt
 remove all files in the directory and the directory itself).  This
 drops users into an unfamiliar situation if the command was run in
 a subdirectory that becomes subject to removal due to the command.
 The commands have been taught to keep an empty directory if it is
 the directory they were started in to avoid surprising users.

 At this point, as Ævar and Emily both read the major part of this

 somebody other than Ævar would be sufficient to move it in some
 direction (hopefully forward).
