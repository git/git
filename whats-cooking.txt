What's cooking in git.git (May 2016, #09; Tue, 31)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

2.9-rc1 has been tagged.  There still are a few topics yet to be
merged to 'master' for the upcoming release, but otherwise this is
pretty much "feature complete".  One known brown-paper-bag breakage
exists in t/perf/, whose fix is still in 'next'.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

* ak/t0008-ksh88-workaround (2016-05-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-05-26 at 9a34a2a)
 + t0008: 4 tests fail with ksh88

 Test portability workaround.

  (merged to 'next' on 2016-05-27 at fd16e6d)
 + t4204: do not let $name variable clobbered

 Update a test to run also under ksh88.


* es/t1500-modernize (2016-05-18) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-05-26 at 274e39c)
 + t1500: avoid setting environment variables outside of tests
 + t1500: avoid setting configuration options outside of tests
 + t1500: avoid changing working directory outside of tests

 test updates to make it more readable and maintainable.


* fc/fast-import-broken-marks-file (2016-05-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-05-26 at 9962fcf)
 + fast-import: do not truncate exported marks file

 "git fast-import --export-marks" would overwrite the existing marks
 file even when it makes a dump from its custom die routine.
 Prevent it from doing so when we have an import-marks file but
 haven't finished reading it.


* jk/cat-file-buffered-batch-all (2016-05-18) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-05-26 at 4da062d)
 + cat-file: default to --buffer when --batch-all-objects is used
 + cat-file: avoid noop calls to sha1_object_info_extended

 "git cat-file --batch-all" has been sped up, by taking advantage
 of the fact that it does not have to read a list of objects, in two
 ways.


* js/t6044-use-test-seq (2016-05-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-05-27 at d052a29)

  (merged to 'next' on 2016-05-27 at 588f76c)
 + mingw: make isatty() recognize MSYS2's pseudo terminals (/dev/pty*)

 The "are we talking with TTY, doing an interactive session?"
 detection has been updated to work better for "Git for Windows".


* mr/send-email-doc-gmail-2fa (2016-05-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-05-27 at 19d6ba4)
 + Documentation: add instructions to help setup gmail 2FA

 Give hints to GMail users with two-factor auth enabled that
 they need app-specific-password when using send-email.


* rj/log-decorate-auto (2016-05-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-05-27 at 813112b)
 + log: document the --decorate=auto option

 We forgot to add "git log --decorate=auto" to documentation when we
 added the feature back in v2.1.0 timeframe.

* js/rebase-i-dedup-call-to-rerere (2016-05-31) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-05-31 at db1f9e3)
 + rebase -i: remove an unnecessary 'rerere' invocation

 "git rebase -i", after it fails to auto-resolve the conflict, had
 an unnecessary call to "git rerere" from its very early days, which
 was spotted recently; the call has been removed.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* sb/submodule-recommend-shallowness (2016-05-27) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-05-31 at 1ee161c)
 + submodule update: learn `--[no-]recommend-shallow` option
 + submodule-config: keep shallow recommendation around

 An upstream project can make a recommendation to make only a
 shallow clone for some submodules in the .gitmodules file it ship.

 Will merge to 'master' after 2.9 final.


* tb/convert-peek-in-index (2016-05-24) 2 commits
 - convert: ce_compare_data() checks for a sha1 of a path

 - README.md: format CLI commands with code syntax

 Will merge to 'next'.


* em/man-bold-literal (2016-05-31) 1 commit
 - Documentation: bold literals in man

 The manpage output of our documentation did not render well in
 terminal; typeset literals in bold by default to make them stand
 out more.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jg/dash-is-last-branch-in-worktree-add (2016-05-31) 1 commit
 - worktree: allow "-" short-hand for @{-1} in add command

 "git worktree add" learned that '-' can be used as a short-hand for
 "@{-1}", the previous branch.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* js/perf-rebase-i (2016-05-31) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-05-31 at 39d8dc8)
 + perf: make the tests work without a worktree

 The one in 'master' has a brown-paper-bag bug that breaks the perf
 test when used inside a usual Git repository with a working tree.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* dk/blame-move-no-reason-for-1-line-context (2016-05-29) 1 commit
 - blame: require 0 context lines while finding moved lines with -M

 "git blame -M" missed a single line that was moved within the file.

 We may want to squash a test or two to this commit.  Volunteers?


* mm/makefile-developer-can-be-in-config-mak (2016-05-31) 1 commit
 - Makefile: move 'ifdef DEVELOPER' after config.mak* inclusion

 "make DEVELOPER=1" worked as expected; setting DEVELOPER=1 in
 config.mak didn't.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* nd/worktree-lock (2016-05-31) 6 commits
 - worktree: add "unlock" command
 - worktree: add "lock" command
 - worktree.c: retrieve lock status (and optionally reason) in get_worktrees()
 - worktree.c: add is_main_worktree()
 - worktree.c: find_worktree() learns to identify worktrees by basename
 - worktree.c: add find_worktree()
 (this branch uses nd/worktree-cleanup-post-head-protection.)

 "git worktree prune" protected worktrees that are marked as
 "locked" by creating a file in a known location.  "git worktree"
 command learned a dedicated command pair to create and remoev such
 a file, so that the users do not have to do this with editor.

 The implementation was wasteful; expecting a reroll.


* pa/cherry-pick-doc-typo (2016-05-29) 1 commit
 - git-cherry-pick.txt: correct a small typo

 "git cherry-pick --help" had three instances of word "behavior",
 one of which was spelled "behaviour", which is updated to match the
 other two.

 - t: use test_cmp_rev() where appropriate
 - t/test-lib-functions.sh: generalize test_cmp_rev
 - bisect: allow 'bisect run' if no good commit is known
 - bisect: write about `bisect next` in documentation

 The internal algorithm used in "git bisect" to find the next commit
 to check has been optimized greatly.

* nd/shallow-deepen (2016-04-13) 26 commits
 - fetch, upload-pack: --deepen=N extends shallow boundary by N commits
 - upload-pack: add get_reachable_list()
 - upload-pack: split check_unreachable() in two, prep for get_reachable_list()
 - t5500, t5539: tests for shallow depth excluding a ref
 - clone: define shallow clone boundary with --shallow-exclude
 - fetch: define shallow boundary with --shallow-exclude
 - upload-pack: support define shallow boundary by excluding revisions
 - refs: add expand_ref()
 - t5500, t5539: tests for shallow depth since a specific date
 - clone: define shallow clone boundary based on time with --shallow-since
 - fetch: define shallow boundary with --shallow-since
 - upload-pack: add deepen-since to cut shallow repos based on time
 - shallow.c: implement a generic shallow boundary finder based on rev-list
 - fetch-pack: use a separate flag for fetch in deepening mode
 - fetch-pack.c: mark strings for translating
 - fetch-pack: use a common function for verbose printing
 - fetch-pack: use skip_prefix() instead of starts_with()
 - upload-pack: move rev-list code out of check_non_tip()
 - upload-pack: tighten number parsing at "deepen" lines
 - upload-pack: use skip_prefix() instead of starts_with()
 - upload-pack: move "unshallow" sending code out of deepen()
 - upload-pack: remove unused variable "backup"
 - upload-pack: move "shallow" sending code out of deepen()
 - upload-pack: move shallow deepen code out of receive_needs()
 - transport-helper.c: refactor set_helper_option()
 - remote-curl.c: convert fetch_git() to use argv_array

 The existing "git fetch --depth=<n>" option was hard to use
 correctly when making the history of an existing shallow clone
 deeper.  A new option, "--deepen=<n>", has been added to make this
 easier to use.  "git clone" also learned "--shallow-since=<date>"
 and "--shallow-exclude=<tag>" options to make it easier to specify
 "I am interested only in the recent N months worth of history" and
 "Give me only the history since that version".

 Needs review.

* az/p4-bare-no-rebase (2016-02-19) 1 commit
 - git-p4.py: Don't try to rebase on submit from bare repository

 "git p4 submit" attempts to do a rebase, which would fail if done
 in a bare repository.  Not doing this rebase would paper over the
 failure, which is what this patch does, but it is unclear what the
 side effect of not rebasing is.

 Needs a better explanation.


* nd/icase (2016-02-15) 12 commits
 - grep.c: reuse "icase" variable
 - diffcore-pickaxe: support case insensitive match on non-ascii
 - diffcore-pickaxe: "share" regex error handling code

 - grep/pcre: prepare locale-dependent tables for icase matching
 - grep/icase: avoid kwsset when -F is specified
 - grep/icase: avoid kwsset on literal non-ascii strings
 - test-regex: expose full regcomp() to the command line
 - test-regex: isolate the bug test code
 - grep: break down an "if" stmt in preparation for next changes
 - grep: allow -F -i combination

 "git grep -i" has been taught to fold case in non-ascii locales.

 Needs review.

* ec/annotate-deleted (2015-11-20) 1 commit
 - annotate: skip checking working tree if a revision is provided

 Usability fix for annotate-specific "<file> <rev>" syntax with deleted
 files.

 Waiting for review.


* dg/subtree-rebase-test (2016-01-19) 1 commit
 - contrib/subtree: Add a test for subtree rebase that loses commits

 Reviewed up to v5.
 Will be rerolled.
 ($gmane/284426)


* js/am-3-merge-recursive-direct (2015-10-12) 2 commits
 - am: make a direct call to merge_recursive
 - merge_recursive_options: introduce the "gently" flag

 The merge_recursive_generic() function has been made a bit safer to
 call from inside a process.  "git am -3" was taught to make a direct
 call to the function when falling back to three-way merge.

 Being able to make a direct call would be good in general, but as a
 performance thing, the change needs to be backed up by numbers.

 I haven't gone through the "gently" change with fine toothed comb;
 I can see that the change avoids calling die(), but I haven't made
 sure that the program states (e.g. what's in the in-core index) are
 adjusted sensibly when it returns to the caller instead of dying,
 or the codepaths that used to die() are free of resource leaks.
 The original code certainly did not care the program states at the
 point of dying exactly because it knew it is going to exit, but now
 they have to care, and they need to be audited.

 Will be rerolled.

* dk/gc-more-wo-pack (2016-01-13) 4 commits

 - t5304: ensure non-garbage files are not deleted
 - t5304: test .bitmap garbage files
 - prepare_packed_git(): find more garbage

 Follow-on to dk/gc-idx-wo-pack topic, to clean up stale
 .bitmap and .keep files.

 Waiting for a reroll.

* jc/diff-b-m (2015-02-23) 5 commits
 . WIPWIP
 . WIP: diff-b-m
 - diffcore-rename: allow easier debugging
 - diffcore-rename.c: add locate_rename_src()
 - diffcore-break: allow debugging

 "git diff -B -M" produced incorrect patch when the postimage of a
 completely rewritten file is similar to the preimage of a removed
 file; such a resulting file must not be expressed as a rename from
 other place.

 The fix in this patch is broken, unfortunately.
 Will discard.


* jc/merge-impossible-no-commit (2016-04-26) 2 commits
 - merge: warn --no-commit merge when no new commit is created
 - merge: do not contaminate option_commit with --squash

 "git merge --no-commit" silently succeeded when there is no need to
 create any commit, either when you are more recent than the commit
 you tried to merge, or you can fast-forward to the commit you tried
 to merge.  The command gives a warning message in such cases.

 Just tying loose ends in a discussion.  Unless somebody else
 champions this topic, I'll drop it.

 Will discard.

* et/pretty-format-c-auto (2016-05-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-05-31 at 1e9c920)
 + format_commit_message: honor `color=auto` for `%C(auto)`

 %C(auto) in a custom format string that commands in `git log`
 family takes unconditionally turned the color on, ignoring
 --no-color or --color=auto with output not connected to a tty;
 this was corrected to make the format truly behave as "auto".

 Will merge to 'master' after 2.9 final.


* ew/daemon-socket-keepalive (2016-05-25) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-05-31 at c32acf1)
 + daemon: enable SO_KEEPALIVE for all sockets

 When "git daemon" is run without --[init-]timeout specified, a
 connection from a client that silently goes offline can hang around
 for a long time, wasting resources.  The socket-level KEEPALIVE has
 been enabled to allow the OS to notice such failed connections.

 Will merge to 'master' after 2.9 final.


* jk/upload-pack-hook (2016-05-27) 6 commits
 - upload-pack: provide a hook for running pack-objects
 - config: add a notion of "scope"
 - config: return configset value for current_config_ functions
 - config: set up config_source for command-line config
 - git_config_parse_parameter: refactor cleanup code
 - git_config_with_options: drop "found" counting

 Allow a custom "git upload-pack" replacement to respond to
 "fetch/clone" request.

 Still under discussion.

* rs/xdiff-hunk-with-func-line (2016-05-31) 8 commits
 - grep: -W: don't extend context to trailing empty lines
 - t7810: add test for grep -W and trailing empty context lines
 - xdiff: don't trim common tail with -W
 - xdiff: -W: don't include common trailing empty lines in context
 - xdiff: ignore empty lines before added functions with -W
 - xdiff: handle appended chunks better with -W
 - xdiff: factor out match_func_rec()
 - t4051: rewrite, add more tests

 "git show -W" (extend hunks to cover the entire function, delimited
 by lines that match the "funcname" pattern) used to show the entire
 file when a change added an entire function at the end of the file,
 which has been fixed.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sb/submodule-misc-cleanups (2016-05-25) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-05-31 at 0d07b9c)

 Minor simplification.

 Will merge to 'master' after 2.9 final.

 "git pull --rebase --verify-signature" learned to warn the user
 that "--verify-signature" is a no-op.

 Will merge to 'master' after 2.9 final.


* ep/http-curl-trace (2016-05-24) 2 commits
 - imap-send.c: introduce the GIT_TRACE_CURL enviroment variable
 - http.c: implement the GIT_TRACE_CURL environment variable

 HTTP transport gained an option to produce more detailed debugging
 trace.

 Rerolled.  Is everybody happy with this version?


* jc/attr (2016-05-25) 18 commits

 + commit.c: use strchrnul() to scan for one line
 (this branch is used by sb/pathspec-label and sb/submodule-default-paths.)

 The attributes API has been updated so that it can later be

 - builtin/apply: move 'read_stdin' global into cmd_apply()
 - builtin/apply: move 'options' variable into cmd_apply()
 - builtin/apply: extract line_by_line_fuzzy_match() from match_fragment()
 - builtin/apply: avoid local variable shadowing 'len' parameter
 - builtin/apply: avoid parameter shadowing 'linenr' global
 - builtin/apply: avoid parameter shadowing 'p_value' global
 - builtin/apply: make gitdiff_verify_name() return void

 The "git apply" standalone program is being libified; this is the
 first step to move many state variables into a structure that can
 be explicitly (re)initialized to make the machinery callable more
 than once.

 The next step that moves some remaining state variables into the
 structure and turns die()s into an error return that propagates up
 to the caller is not queued yet but in flight.  It would be good to
 review the above first and give the remainder of the series a solid
 base to build on.

 Reroll exists, but hasn't seen any review yet ($gmane/295429).


* pb/bisect (2016-05-24) 3 commits
 - bisect--helper: `write_terms` shell function in C

* sb/pathspec-label (2016-05-25) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-05-31 at e72b604)
 + pathspec: allow querying for attributes
 + pathspec: move prefix check out of the inner loop
 + pathspec: move long magic parsing out of prefix_pathspec
 + Documentation: fix a typo
 (this branch is used by sb/submodule-default-paths; uses jc/attr.)

 The pathspec mechanism learned ":(attr:X)$pattern" pathspec magic
 to limit paths that match $pattern further by attribute settings.

 Will merge to 'master' after 2.9 final.


* nd/worktree-cleanup-post-head-protection (2016-05-24) 6 commits

* mh/connect-leak (2016-04-28) 1 commit
 - git_connect(): fix memory leak with CONNECT_DIAG_URL

 Is already made obsolete with a patch in flight under discussion.
 ($gmane/292962)

 Will discard.


* ew/fast-import-unpack-limit (2016-05-29) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-05-29 at af32aba)
 + fast-import: invalidate pack_id references after loosening
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-05-11 at ffd4efb)
 + fast-import: implement unpack limit

 "git fast-import" learned the same performance trick to avoid
 creating too small a packfile as "git fetch" and "git push" have,
 using *.unpackLimit configuration.

 Will hold.


* jc/send-email-skip-backup (2016-04-12) 1 commit
 - send-email: detect and offer to skip backup files

 A careless invocation of "git send-email directory/" after editing
 0001-change.patch with an editor often ends up sending both
 0001-change.patch and its backup file, 0001-change.patch~, causing
 embarrassment and a minor confusion.  Detect such an input and
 offer to skip the backup files when sending the patches out.

 Needs review.

* jc/bundle (2016-03-03) 6 commits
 - index-pack: --clone-bundle option
 - Merge branch 'jc/index-pack' into jc/bundle
 - bundle v3: the beginning
 - bundle: keep a copy of bundle file name in the in-core bundle header

 The beginning of "split bundle", which could be one of the
 ingredients to allow "git clone" traffic off of the core server
 network to CDN.


* jc/merge-drop-old-syntax (2015-04-29) 1 commit
 - merge: drop 'git merge <message> HEAD <commit>' syntax

 Stop supporting "git merge <message> HEAD <commit>" syntax that has
 been deprecated since October 2007, and issues a deprecation
 warning message since v2.5.0.

 It has been reported that git-gui still uses the deprecated syntax,
 which needs to be fixed before this final step can proceed.
