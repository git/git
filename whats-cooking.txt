What's cooking in git.git (Jun 2021, #06; Thu, 17)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen' while commits prefixed with '+'
are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of the
integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.  Generally,
being in 'next' is a sign that a topic is stable enough to be used
and are candidate to be in a future release, while being in 'seen'
means nothing more than that the maintainer has found it interesting
for some reason (like "it may have hard-to-resolve conflicts with
another topic already in flight" or "this may turn out to be
useful")---do not read too much into a topic being in (or not in)
'seen'.

The tip of 'next' has been rewound.  We'll start merging topics that
have been reviewed well down.  On the other hand, some topics have
been waiting for updates for too long.  I've started marking them
for discarding.  Motivated contributors may want to take a look of
them, pick an easy one or two, reroll them on behalf of the original
authors, to resurrect them.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

* js/stop-exporting-bogus-columns (2021-06-17) 1 commit
 - pager: do not unnecessarily set COLUMNS on Windows

 When we cannot figure out how wide the terminal is, we use a
 fallback value of 80 ourselves (which cannot be avoided), but when
 we run the pager, we export it in COLUMNS, which forces the pager
 to use the hardcoded value, even when the pager is perfectly
 capable to figure it out itself.  Stop exporting COLUMNS
 only when building on Windows to work around this issue.

* ao/p4-avoid-decoding (2021-04-12) 2 commits
 - git-p4: do not decode data from perforce by default

 "git p4" in Python-2 days used to accept a lot more kinds of data

 which broke traditional use cases.

 Waiting for reviews.
