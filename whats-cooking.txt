What's cooking in git.git (Apr 2019, #05; Thu, 25)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

[Graduated to "master"]

* ab/commit-graph-fixes (2019-04-01) 8 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-16 at 97f4ba02f0)

 + commit-graph tests: split up corrupt_graph_and_verify()
 (this branch is used by ds/commit-graph-format-v2.)

 Code cleanup with more careful error checking before using data
 read from the commit-graph file.


* ab/gc-docs (2019-04-08) 11 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-22 at 02785d40f5)
 + gc docs: remove incorrect reference to gc.auto=0

 Update docs around "gc".


* ab/gc-reflog (2019-04-01) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-16 at aa27f951a8)
 + gc: handle & check gc.reflogExpire config

* ab/test-lib-pass-trace2-env (2019-04-01) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-16 at 4dad6d6d7a)
 + test-lib: whitelist GIT_TR2_* in the environment

 Allow tracing of Git executable while running the testsuite.


* ag/sequencer-reduce-rewriting-todo (2019-03-07) 18 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-10 at 7eab7c7800)
 + rebase--interactive: move transform_todo_file()
 + sequencer: use edit_todo_list() in complete_action()
 + rebase-interactive: rewrite edit_todo_list() to handle the initial edit
 + rebase-interactive: append_todo_help() changes

 + sequencer: remove the 'arg' field from todo_item
 + sequencer: make the todo_list structure public
 + sequencer: changes in parse_insn_buffer()
 (this branch is used by pw/rebase-i-internal.)

 The scripted version of "git rebase -i" wrote and rewrote the todo
 list many times during a single step of its operation, and the
 recent C-rewrite made a faithful conversion of the logic to C.  The
 implementation has been updated to carry necessary information
 around in-core to avoid rewriting the same file over and over
 unnecessarily.

* bc/send-email-qp-cr (2019-04-14) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-22 at 69398b0ea8)
 + send-email: default to quoted-printable when CR is present

 "git send-email" has been taught to use quoted-printable when the
 payload contains carriage-return.  The use of the mechanism is in
 line with the design originally added the codepath that chooses QP
 when the payload has overly long lines.


* bp/post-index-change-hook (2019-02-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-03-11 at cb96d1d7c4)
 + read-cache: add post-index-change hook

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2019-02-23

 A new hook "post-index-change" is called when the on-disk index
 file changes, which can help e.g. a virtualized working tree
 implementation.


* bs/sendemail-tighten-anything-by (2019-04-04) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-22 at 0a0680f234)
 + send-email: don't cc *-by lines with '-' prefix

 The recently added feature to add addresses that are on
 anything-by: trailers in 'git send-email' was found to be way too
 eager and considered nonsense strings as if they can be legitimate
 beginning of *-by: trailer.  This has been tightened.


* dk/blame-keep-origin-blob (2019-04-03) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-16 at 39679dde8b)
 + blame.c: don't drop origin blobs as eagerly

 Performance fix around "git blame", especially in a linear history
 (which is the norm we should optimize for).


* dl/submodule-set-branch (2019-04-10) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-22 at 3b640715ae)
 + submodule: teach set-branch subcommand
 + submodule--helper: teach config subcommand --unset
 + git-submodule.txt: "--branch <branch>" option defaults to 'master'

 + fast-import: only allow cat-blob requests where it makes sense
 + fast-import: check most prominent commands first
 + git-fast-import.txt: fix wording about where ls command can appear
 + t9300: demonstrate bug with get-mark and empty orphan commits

 "git fast-import" update.


* jc/gettext-test-fix (2019-04-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-22 at 7c57deeb04)
 + gettext tests: export the restored GIT_TEST_GETTEXT_POISON

 The GETTEXT_POISON test option has been quite broken ever since it
 was made runtime-tunable, which has been fixed.


* jk/fetch-reachability-error-fix (2019-04-15) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-22 at b4ce8375c0)

 + fetch: use free_refs()
 + pkt-line: prepare buffer before handling ERR packets
 + upload-pack: send ERR packet for non-tip objects
 + t5530: check protocol response for "not our ref"
 + t5516: drop ok=sigpipe from unreachable-want tests

 Code clean-up and a fix for "git fetch" by an explicit object name
 (as opposed to fetching refs by name).


* jk/revision-rewritten-parents-in-prio-queue (2019-04-04) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-16 at bdc1465128)

 + progress: use xmalloc/xcalloc
 + xdiff: use xmalloc/xrealloc
 + xdiff: use git-compat-util
 + test-prio-queue: use xmalloc

 The code is updated to check the result of memory allocation before
 it is used in more places, by using xmalloc and/or xcalloc calls.


* js/difftool-no-index (2019-03-18) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-16 at 7313f9ff18)
 + difftool: allow running outside Git worktrees with --no-index
 + parse-options: make OPT_ARGUMENT() more useful
 + difftool: remove obsolete (and misleading) comment

 "git difftool" can now run outside a repository.

  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-22 at c2fadead33)
 + t9822: skip tests if file names cannot be ISO-8859-1 encoded

 Test fix on APFS that is incapable of store paths in Latin-1.


* js/macos-gettext-build (2019-04-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-22 at de4cbb1431)
 + macOS: make sure that gettext is found

 Build with gettext breaks on recent macOS w/ Homebrew when
 /usr/local/bin is not on PATH, which has been corrected.


* js/t3301-unbreak-notes-test (2019-04-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-22 at a015b00bd9)
 + t3301: fix false negative

 Test fix.


* js/untracked-cache-allocfix (2019-04-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-22 at 004a544075)
 + untracked cache: fix off-by-one
 (this branch is used by jk/untracked-cache-more-fixes.)

 An underallocation in the code to read the untracked cache
 extension has been corrected.


* jt/batch-fetch-blobs-in-diff (2019-04-08) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-22 at 0598bae567)
 + diff: batch fetching of missing blobs
 + sha1-file: support OBJECT_INFO_FOR_PREFETCH
 (this branch is used by cc/multi-promisor.)

 While running "git diff" in a lazy clone, we can upfront know which
 missing blobs we will need, instead of waiting for the on-demand
 machinery to discover them one by one.  Aim to achieve better
 performance by batching the request for these promised blobs.


* jt/fetch-no-update-shallow-in-proto-v2 (2019-04-01) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-16 at 05c5ebe471)
 + fetch-pack: respect --no-update-shallow in v2
 + fetch-pack: call prepare_shallow_info only if v0
 + Merge branch 'jt/test-protocol-version' into jt/fetch-no-update-shallow-in-proto-v2

 Fix for protocol v2 support in "git fetch-pack" of shallow clones.

  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-22 at 2d5aa01ca6)
 + t3000 (ls-files -o): widen description to reflect current tests

 A test update.


* nd/checkout-m (2019-03-24) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-16 at 4d7c322bed)
 + checkout: prevent losing staged changes with --merge
 + read-tree: add --quiet
 + unpack-trees: rename "gently" flag to "quiet"
 + unpack-trees: keep gently check inside add_rejected_path

 "git checkout -m <other>" was about carrying the differences
 between HEAD and the working-tree files forward while checking out
 another branch, and ignored the differences between HEAD and the
 index.  The command has been taught to abort when the index and the
 HEAD are different.


* nd/commit-a-with-paths-msg-update (2019-03-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-16 at a36c712b39)
 + commit: improve error message in "-a <paths>" case

 The message given when "git commit -a <paths>" errors out has been
 updated.


* nd/diff-parseopt-4 (2019-03-24) 20 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-10 at 893b135f10)
 + am: avoid diff_opt_parse()
 + diff --no-index: use parse_options() instead of diff_opt_parse()

 + diff-parseopt: convert --pickaxe-all|--pickaxe-regex
 + diff-parseopt: convert -S|-G
 + diff-parseopt: convert -l
 + diff-parseopt: convert -z
 + diff-parseopt: convert --ita-[in]visible-in-index
 + diff-parseopt: convert --ws-error-highlight

 Fourth batch to teach the diff machinery to use the parse-options
 API.


* nd/submodule-foreach-quiet (2019-04-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-22 at bf982bca7b)
 + submodule foreach: fix "<command> --quiet" not being respected

 "git submodule foreach <command> --quiet" did not pass the option
 down correctly, which has been corrected.


* po/describe-not-necessarily-7 (2019-04-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-22 at 65b47ca73f)
 + describe doc: remove '7-char' abbreviation reference

 Docfix.


* po/rerere-doc-fmt (2019-04-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-22 at 780c0d2450)
 + rerere doc: quote `rerere.enabled`

 Docfix.


* pw/cherry-pick-continue (2019-03-18) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-16 at 1bfd7a7179)
 + cherry-pick --continue: remember options
 + cherry-pick: demonstrate option amnesia
 + sequencer: break some long lines

 "git cherry-pick --options A..B", after giving control back to the
 user to ask help resolving a conflicted step, did not honor the
 options it originally received, which has been corrected.


* sg/blame-in-bare-start-at-head (2019-04-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-22 at 159777c280)
 + blame: default to HEAD in a bare repo when no start commit is given

 "git blame -- path" in a non-bare repository starts blaming from
 the working tree, and the same command in a bare repository errors
 out because there is no working tree by definition.  The command
 has been taught to instead start blaming from the commit at HEAD,
 which is more useful.


* sg/index-pack-progress (2019-04-01) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-16 at a10bfdd950)
 + index-pack: show progress while checking objects

 A progress indicator has been added to the "index-pack" step, which
 often makes users wait for completion during "git clone".


* sg/overlong-progress-fix (2019-04-15) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-22 at 69921cdf09)
 + progress: break too long progress bar lines
 + progress: clear previous progress update dynamically
 + progress: assemble percentage and counters in a strbuf before printing
 + progress: make display_progress() return void

 Updating the display with progress message has been cleaned up to
 deal better with overlong messages.


* sg/test-atexit (2019-03-14) 11 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-10 at 7839135291)
 + t9811-git-p4-label-import: fix pipeline negation
 + git p4 test: disable '-x' tracing in the p4d watchdog loop
 + git p4 test: simplify timeout handling
 + git p4 test: clean up the p4d cleanup functions
 + git p4 test: use 'test_atexit' to kill p4d and the watchdog process
 + t0301-credential-cache: use 'test_atexit' to stop the credentials helper
 + tests: use 'test_atexit' to stop httpd
 + git-daemon: use 'test_atexit` to stop 'git-daemon'
 + test-lib: introduce 'test_atexit'
 + t/lib-git-daemon: make sure to kill the 'git-daemon' process
 + test-lib: fix interrupt handling with 'dash' and '--verbose-log -x'

 Test framework update to more robustly clean up leftover files and
 processes after tests are done.


* tg/ls-files-debug-format-fix (2019-04-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-22 at a5ac1ca49f)
 + ls-files: use correct format string

 Debugging code fix.


* tz/doc-apostrophe-no-longer-needed (2019-04-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-22 at 8ff03863ce)
 + Documentation/git-show-branch: avoid literal {apostrophe}

 Doc formatting fix.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* jc/make-dedup-ls-files-output (2019-04-22) 1 commit
 - Makefile: dedup list of files obtained from ls-files

 A "ls-files" that emulates "find" to enumerate files in the working
 tree resulted in duplicated Makefile rules that caused the build to
 issue an unnecessary warning during a trial build after merge
 conflicts are resolved in working tree *.h files but before the
 resolved results are added to the index.  This has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.
 A not-so-low hanging fruit to teach ls-files to dedup either optionally
 or always has also been discussed, which probably is a good idea,
 to prevent mistakes similar to the bug this topic fixes in the future.


* jk/ls-files-doc-markup-fix (2019-04-23) 1 commit
 - doc/ls-files: put nested list for "-t" option into block

 Docfix.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/p5302-avoid-collision-check-cost (2019-04-23) 1 commit
 - p5302: create the repo in each index-pack test

 Fix index-pack perf test so that the repeated invocations always
 run in an empty repository, which emulates the initial clone
 situation better.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* dl/rev-tilde-doc-clarify (2019-04-24) 1 commit
 - revisions.txt: mention <rev>~ form

 Docfix.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* en/unicode-in-refnames (2019-04-24) 1 commit
 - Honor core.precomposeUnicode in more places

 The names of the refs stored as filesystem entities may become
 different from what the end-user expects, just like files in the
 working tree gets "renamed", on a filesystem like HFS+.  Work it
 around by paying attemption to the core.precomposeUnicode
 configuration.

 Looked sensible.  Ready for next?


* jk/perf-aggregate-wo-libjson (2019-04-24) 1 commit
 - t/perf: depend on perl JSON only when using --codespeed

 The script to aggregate perf result unconditionally depended on
 libjson-perl even though it did not have to, which has been
 corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* cc/access-on-aix-workaround (2019-04-25) 1 commit
 - git-compat-util: work around for access(X_OK) under root
 (this branch uses cc/aix-has-fileno-as-a-macro.)


* dl/difftool-mergetool (2019-04-25) 6 commits
 - difftool: fallback on merge.guitool
 - difftool: make --gui, --tool and --extcmd mutually exclusive
 - mergetool: fallback to tool when guitool unavailable
 - mergetool: use get_merge_tool function
 - t7610: add mergetool --gui tests
 - t7610: unsuppress output

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* nb/branch-show-other-worktrees-head (2019-03-18) 3 commits
 - branch: add worktree info on verbose output
 - branch: update output to include worktree info
 - ref-filter: add worktreepath atom

 "git branch --list" learned to show branches that are checked out
 in other worktrees connected to the same repository prefixed with
 '+', similar to the way the currently checked out branch is shown
 with '*' in front.

* jt/fetch-cdn-offload (2019-03-12) 9 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - upload-pack: send part of packfile response as uri
 - fetch-pack: support more than one pack lockfile
 - upload-pack: refactor reading of pack-objects out
 - Documentation: add Packfile URIs design doc
 - Documentation: order protocol v2 sections
 - http-fetch: support fetching packfiles by URL
 - http: improve documentation of http_pack_request
 - http: use --stdin when getting dumb HTTP pack

 WIP for allowing a response to "git fetch" to instruct the bulk of
 the pack contents to be instead taken from elsewhere (aka CDN).

 Still being discussed.


* js/add-i-coalesce-after-editing-hunk (2018-08-28) 1 commit
 - add -p: coalesce hunks before testing applicability

 Applicability check after a patch is edited in a "git add -i/p"

 the URL field with a new value.

 Anybody who wants to champion this topic?

 + worktree: update is_bare heuristics

 The logic to tell if a Git repository has a working tree protects

 out by mistake.  The implementation of this logic was broken for
 repositories with unusual name, which unfortunately is the norm for
 submodules these days.  This has been fixed.

 "git merge-recursive" backend recently learned a new heuristics to
 infer file movement based on how other files in the same directory
 moved.  As this is inherently less robust heuristics than the one
 based on the content similarity of the file itself (rather than
 based on what its neighbours are doing), it sometimes gives an
 outcome unexpected by the end users.  This has been toned down to
 leave the renamed paths in higher/conflicted stages in the index so
 that the user can examine and confirm the result.

 Running "git add" on a repository created inside the current
 repository is an explicit indication that the user wants to add it
 as a submodule, but when the HEAD of the inner repository is on an
 unborn branch, it cannot be added as a submodule.  Worse, the files
 in its working tree can be added as if they are a part of the outer
 repository, which is not what the user wants.  These problems are
 being addressed.

 - Move init_skiplist() outside of fsck

 "git blame" learned to "ignore" commits in the history, whose
 effects (as well as their presence) get ignored.

 Expecting a reroll.

 (this branch uses pw/sequencer-cleanup-with-signoff-x-fix.)

 The list of conflicted paths shown in the editor while concluding a
 conflicted merge was shown above the scissors line when the
 clean-up mode is set to "scissors", even though it was commented
 out just like the list of updated paths and other information to
 help the user explain the merge better.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 exist is getting revamped.

 Expecting a reroll.
