What's cooking in git.git (Apr 2023, #06; Thu, 20)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a future
release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and aren't
considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL to a
message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

Release tarballs are available at:

 setting pull.rebase=true, but these days pull.rebase=merges may be
 more inline with the original spirit of "rebuild your side on top

 When "gc" needs to retain unreachable objects, packing them into
 cruft packs (instead of exploding them into loose object files) has
 been offered as a more efficient option for some time.  Now the use
 of cruft packs has been made the default and no longer considered
 an experimental feature.

* es/recurse-submodules-option-is-a-bool (2023-04-10) 1 commit
 - usage: clarify --recurse-submodules as a boolean

 The "--[no-]recurse-submodules" option of "git checkout" and others
 supported an undocumented syntax --recurse-submodules=<value> where
 the value can spell a Boolean in various ways.  The support for the
 syntax is being dropped.

 Expecting a reroll.
