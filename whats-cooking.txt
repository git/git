What's cooking in git.git (Jan 2024, #07; Tue, 23)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and
aren't considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL
to a message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity (of course they can be resubmit when new interests
arise).

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

 - commit-graph: new Bloom filter version that fixes murmur3
 - repo-settings: introduce commitgraph.changedPathsVersion
 - t4216: test changed path filters with high bit paths
 - t/helper/test-read-graph: implement `bloom-filters` mode
 - bloom.h: make `load_bloom_filter_from_graph()` public
 - t/helper/test-read-graph.c: extract `dump_graph_info()`
 - gitformat-commit-graph: describe version 2 of BDAT
 - commit-graph: ensure Bloom filters are read with consistent settings
 - revision.c: consult Bloom filters for root commits
 - t/t4216-log-bloom.sh: harden `test_bloom_filters_not_used()`

 The Bloom filter used for path limited history traversal was broken
 on systems whose "char" is unsigned; update the implementation and
 bump the format version to 2.
