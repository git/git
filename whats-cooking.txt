What's cooking in git.git (Jan 2013, #05; Fri, 11)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.

As usual, this cycle is expected to last for 8 to 10 weeks, with a
preview -rc0 sometime in the middle of next month.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches of the
repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-07 at 9e2ee43)
 + rebase: Handle cases where format-patch fails

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-01-02

 Save output from format-patch command in a temporary file, just in
 case it aborts, to give a better failure-case behaviour.

 + merge --no-edit: do not credit people involved in the side branch

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-01-02

 Stop spending cycles to compute information to be placed on
 commented lines in "merge --no-edit".

  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-08 at f986500)
 + Makefile: hoist uname autodetection to config.mak.uname

 Move the bits to set fallback default based on the platform from
 the main Makefile to a separate file, so that it can be included in
 Makefiles in subdirectories.


* jl/interrupt-clone-remove-separate-git-dir (2013-01-05) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-08 at 568f874)
 + clone: support atomic operation with --separate-git-dir

 When "git clone --separate-git-dir" is interrupted, we failed to
 remove the real location we created the repository.


* mz/pick-unborn (2012-12-23) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-07 at c6c062b)
 + learn to pick/revert into unborn branch
 + tests: move test_cmp_rev to test-lib-functions

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-01-02

 Allows "git cherry-pick $commit" when you do not have any history
 behind HEAD yet.


* nd/wildmatch (2013-01-01) 18 commits

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-01-01

 Allows pathname patterns in .gitignore and .gitattributes files
 with double-asterisks "foo/**/bar" to match any number of directory
 hierarchies.


* rs/leave-base-name-in-name-field-of-tar (2013-01-05) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-08 at 98f325e)
 + archive-tar: split long paths more carefully

 Improve compatibility with implementations of "tar" that do not
 like empty name field in header (with the additional prefix field
 holding everything).


* tb/test-shell-lint (2013-01-02) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-07 at 0bca54a)

  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-10 at 9f3950d)
 + git-fast-import(1): reorganise options
 + git-fast-import(1): combine documentation of --[no-]relative-marks

 Will merge to 'master'.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* rt/commit-cleanup-config (2013-01-10) 1 commit
 - commit: make default of "cleanup" option configurable

 Add a configuration variable to set default clean-up mode other
 than "strip".

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jc/custom-comment-char (2013-01-10) 1 commit
 - Allow custom "comment char"

 An illustration to show codepaths that need to be touched to change
 the hint lines in the edited text to begin with something other
 than '#'.


* jn/maint-trim-vim-contrib (2013-01-10) 1 commit
 - contrib/vim: simplify instructions for old vim support

 Will merge to 'next'.


* mz/reset-misc (2013-01-10) 22 commits
 - reset [--mixed]: use diff-based reset whether or not pathspec was given
 - [SQUASH???] script portability fixes
 - reset: allow reset on unborn branch
 - reset $sha1 $pathspec: require $sha1 only to be treeish
 - reset [--mixed] --quiet: don't refresh index
 - reset.c: finish entire cmd_reset() whether or not pathspec is given
 - reset [--mixed]: don't write index file twice
 - reset.c: move lock, write and commit out of update_index_refresh()
 - reset.c: move update_index_refresh() call out of read_from_tree()
 - reset: avoid redundant error message
 - reset --keep: only write index file once
 - reset.c: replace switch by if-else
 - reset.c: share call to die_if_unmerged_cache()
 - [SQUASH???] style fixes
 - reset.c: extract function for updating {ORIG,}HEAD

 - reset $pathspec: exit with code 0 if successful
 - reset $pathspec: no need to discard index

 Various 'reset' optimizations and clean-ups, followed by a change
 to allow "git reset" to work even on an unborn branch.


* pe/doc-email-env-is-trumped-by-config (2013-01-10) 1 commit
 - git-commit-tree(1): correct description of defaults

 In the precedence order, the environment variable $EMAIL comes
 between the built-in default (i.e. taking value by asking the
 system's gethostname() etc.) and the user.email configuration
 variable; the documentation implied that it is stronger than the
 configuration like $GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL is, which is wrong.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ds/completion-silence-in-tree-path-probe (2013-01-11) 1 commit
 - git-completion.bash: silence "not a valid object" errors

 An internal ls-tree call made by completion code only to probe if
 a path exists in the tree recorded in a commit object leaked error
 messages when the path is not there.  It is not an error at all and
 should not be shown to the end user.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* er/replace-cvsimport (2013-01-11) 4 commits
 - t9604: fixup for new cvsimport
 - t9600: fixup for new cvsimport
 - t/lib-cvs.sh: allow cvsps version 3.x.
 - cvsimport: rewrite to use cvsps 3.x to fix major bugs

 Rewrite of cvsimport to talk with cvsps 3.x; this negatively
 affects existing users of cvsimport that only have cvsps 2.x and
 use -o, -M and -m options (they cannot use the old cvsimport with
 old cvsps 2.x in the fall-back mode, even though these options are
 supported by the old one), but it is not known how common they are.

 For people who work with complex CVS histories that needs cvsps 3.x
 to import correctly, this version should be a definite improvement,
 so I would love to see small wrinkles in the new implementation
 straightened out.  Help from people with Python experience would be
 appreciated in reviewing and patching.


* nd/fetch-depth-is-broken (2013-01-11) 3 commits
 - fetch: elaborate --depth action
 - upload-pack: fix off-by-one depth calculation in shallow clone
 - fetch: add --unshallow for turning shallow repo into complete one

 "git fetch --depth" was broken in at least three ways.  The
 resulting history was deeper than specified by one commit, it was
 unclear how to wipe the shallowness of the repository with the
 command, and documentation was misleading.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jc/no-git-config-in-clone (2013-01-11) 1 commit
 - clone: do not export and unexport GIT_CONFIG

 We stopped paying attention to $GIT_CONFIG environment that points
 at a single configuration file from any command other than "git config"
 quite a while ago, but "git clone" internally set, exported, and
 then unexported the variable during its operation unnecessarily.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* jl/submodule-deinit (2012-12-04) 1 commit
 - submodule: add 'deinit' command

 There was no Porcelain way to say "I no longer am interested in
 this submodule", once you express your interest in a submodule with
 "submodule init".  "submodule deinit" is the way to do so.

 Expecting a reroll.
 $gmane/212884


* jk/lua-hackery (2012-10-07) 6 commits
 - pretty: fix up one-off format_commit_message calls
 - Minimum compilation fixup
 - Makefile: make "lua" a bit more configurable
 - add a "lua" pretty format
 - add basic lua infrastructure
 - pretty: make some commit-parsing helpers more public

 Interesting exercise. When we do this for real, we probably would want
 to wrap a commit to make it more like an "object" with methods like
 "parents", etc.


* rc/maint-complete-git-p4 (2012-09-24) 1 commit
 - Teach git-completion about git p4

 Comment from Pete will need to be addressed ($gmane/206172).


* jc/maint-name-rev (2012-09-17) 7 commits
 - describe --contains: use "name-rev --algorithm=weight"
 - name-rev --algorithm=weight: tests and documentation
 - name-rev --algorithm=weight: cache the computed weight in notes
 - name-rev --algorithm=weight: trivial optimization
 - name-rev: --algorithm option
 - name_rev: clarify the logic to assign a new tip-name to a commit
 - name-rev: lose unnecessary typedef

 "git name-rev" names the given revision based on a ref that can be
 reached in the smallest number of steps from the rev, but that is
 not useful when the caller wants to know which tag is the oldest one
 that contains the rev.  This teaches a new mode to the command that
 uses the oldest ref among those which contain the rev.

 I am not sure if this is worth it; for one thing, even with the help
 from notes-cache, it seems to make the "describe --contains" even
 slower. Also the command will be unusably slow for a user who does
 not have a write access (hence unable to create or update the
 notes-cache).

 Stalled mostly due to lack of responses.


* jc/xprm-generation (2012-09-14) 1 commit
 - test-generation: compute generation numbers and clock skews

 A toy to analyze how bad the clock skews are in histories of real
 world projects.

 Stalled mostly due to lack of responses.


* jc/add-delete-default (2012-08-13) 1 commit
 - git add: notice removal of tracked paths by default

 "git add dir/" updated modified files and added new files, but does
 not notice removed files, which may be "Huh?" to some users.  They
 can of course use "git add -A dir/", but why should they?

 Resurrected from graveyard, as I thought it was a worthwhile thing
 to do in the longer term.

 Stalled mostly due to lack of responses.


* mb/remote-default-nn-origin (2012-07-11) 6 commits
 - Teach get_default_remote to respect remote.default.
 - Test that plain "git fetch" uses remote.default when on a detached HEAD.
 - Teach clone to set remote.default.
 - Teach "git remote" about remote.default.
 - Teach remote.c about the remote.default configuration setting.
 - Rename remote.c's default_remote_name static variables.

 When the user does not specify what remote to interact with, we
 often attempt to use 'origin'.  This can now be customized via a
 configuration variable.

 Expecting a reroll.
 $gmane/210151

 "The first remote becomes the default" bit is better done as a
 separate step.

* nz/send-email-headers-are-case-insensitive (2013-01-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-10 at cf4c9c9)
 + git-send-email: treat field names as case-insensitively

 When user spells "cc:" in lowercase in the fake "header" in the
 trailer part, send-email failed to pick up the addresses from
 there. As e-mail headers field names are case insensitive, this
 script should follow suit and treat "cc:" and "Cc:" the same way.


* mk/complete-tcsh (2013-01-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-11 at b8b30b1)
 + Prevent space after directories in tcsh completion

 Update tcsh command line completion so that an unwanted space is
 not added to a single directory name.


* dg/subtree-fixes (2013-01-08) 7 commits
 - contrib/subtree: mkdir the manual directory if needed
 - contrib/subtree: honor $(DESTDIR)
 - contrib/subtree: fix synopsis and command help
 - contrib/subtree: better error handling for "add"
 - contrib/subtree: add --unannotate option
 - contrib/subtree: use %B for split Subject/Body
 - t7900: remove test number comments

 contrib/subtree updates.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ap/log-mailmap (2013-01-10) 11 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-10 at 8544084)

 + log: add log.mailmap configuration option
 + log: grep author/committer using mailmap
 + test: add test for --use-mailmap option
 + log: add --use-mailmap option
 + pretty: use mailmap to display username and email
 + mailmap: add mailmap structure to rev_info and pp
 + mailmap: simplify map_user() interface
 + mailmap: remove email copy and length limitation
 + Use split_ident_line to parse author and committer
 + string-list: allow case-insensitive string list

 Teach commands in the "log" family to optionally pay attention to
 the mailmap.


* nd/upload-pack-shallow-must-be-commit (2013-01-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-10 at a8b3ba5)
 + upload-pack: only accept commits from "shallow" line

 A minor consistency check patch that does not have much relevance
 to the real world.


* jc/blame-no-follow (2012-09-21) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-10 at 201c7f4)
 + blame: pay attention to --no-follow
 + diff: accept --no-follow option

 Teaches "--no-follow" option to "git blame" to disable its
 whole-file rename detection.


* jc/push-2.0-default-to-simple (2013-01-08) 11 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-09 at 74c3498)
 + doc: push.default is no longer "matching"
 + push: switch default from "matching" to "simple"
 + t9401: do not assume the "matching" push is the default
 + t9400: do not assume the "matching" push is the default
 + t7406: do not assume the "matching" push is the default
 + t5531: do not assume the "matching" push is the default
 + t5519: do not assume the "matching" push is the default
 + t5517: do not assume the "matching" push is the default
 + t5516: do not assume the "matching" push is the default
 + t5505: do not assume the "matching" push is the default
 + t5404: do not assume the "matching" push is the default

 Will cook in 'next' until Git 2.0 ;-).


* jk/unify-exit-code-by-receiving-signal (2013-01-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-08 at 5ebf940)
 + run-command: encode signal death as a positive integer

 The internal logic had to deal with two representations of a death
 of a child process by a signal.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jn/xml-depends-on-asciidoc-conf (2013-01-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-08 at 4faf8d4)
 + docs: manpage XML depends on asciidoc.conf

 Will merge to 'master'.


* nd/clone-no-separate-git-dir-with-bare (2013-01-10) 1 commit
 - clone: forbid --bare --separate-git-dir <dir>

 Will merge to 'next'.


* nd/parse-pathspec (2013-01-11) 20 commits
 - Convert more init_pathspec() to parse_pathspec()
 - Convert add_files_to_cache to take struct pathspec
 - Convert {read,fill}_directory to take struct pathspec
 - Convert refresh_index to take struct pathspec
 - Convert report_path_error to take struct pathspec
 - checkout: convert read_tree_some to take struct pathspec
 - Convert unmerge_cache to take struct pathspec
 - Convert read_cache_preload() to take struct pathspec
 - add: convert to use parse_pathspec
 - archive: convert to use parse_pathspec
 - ls-files: convert to use parse_pathspec
 - rm: convert to use parse_pathspec
 - checkout: convert to use parse_pathspec
 - rerere: convert to use parse_pathspec
 - status: convert to use parse_pathspec
 - commit: convert to use parse_pathspec
 - clean: convert to use parse_pathspec
 - Export parse_pathspec() and convert some get_pathspec() calls
 - Add parse_pathspec() that converts cmdline args to struct pathspec
 - pathspec: save the non-wildcard length part

 Uses the parsed pathspec structure in more places where we used to
 use the raw "array of strings" pathspec.

 Unfortunately, this conflicts a couple of topics in flight. I tried
 to be careful while resolving conflicts, though.


* rs/zip-tests (2013-01-07) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-08 at 8e37423)
 + t5003: check if unzip supports symlinks
 + t5000, t5003: move ZIP tests into their own script
 + t0024, t5000: use test_lazy_prereq for UNZIP
 + t0024, t5000: clear variable UNZIP, use GIT_UNZIP instead

 Updates zip tests to skip some that cannot be handled on platform
 unzip.

 I've renamed the t5002 in the original to t5003 to avoid name
 clashes with another topic in flight.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* rs/zip-with-uncompressed-size-in-the-header (2013-01-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-08 at d9ec30e)
 + archive-zip: write uncompressed size into header even with streaming

 Improve compatibility of our zip output to fill uncompressed size
 in the header, which we can do without seeking back (even though it
 should not be necessary).

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/doc-maintainer (2013-01-03) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-11 at f35d582)
 + howto/maintain: mark titles for asciidoc
 + Documentation: update "howto maintain git"

 Describe tools for automation that were invented since this
 document was originally written.


* fc/remote-testgit-feature-done (2012-10-29) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-10 at 3132a60)
 + remote-testgit: properly check for errors

 In the longer term, tightening rules is a good thing to do, and
 because nobody who has worked in the remote helper area seems to be
 interested in reviewing this, I would assume they do not think
 such a retroactive tightening will affect their remote helpers.  So
 let's advance this topic to see what happens.


* mo/cvs-server-updates (2012-12-09) 18 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-08 at 75e2d11)

 + cvsserver: define a tag name character escape mechanism
 + cvsserver: cleanup extra slashes in filename arguments
 + cvsserver: factor out git-log parsing logic

 Various git-cvsserver updates.

 Will cook in 'next' for a while to see if anybody screams.


* ap/status-ignored-in-ignored-directory (2013-01-07) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-10 at 20f7476)

 Add a new command "git check-ignore" for debugging .gitignore
 files.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jc/format-patch-reroll (2013-01-03) 9 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-07 at 0e007e6)
 + format-patch: give --reroll-count a short synonym -v
 + format-patch: document and test --reroll-count
 + format-patch: add --reroll-count=$N option

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-01-04

 Teach "format-patch" to prefix v4- to its output files for the
 fourth iteration of a patch series, to make it easier for the
 submitter to keep separate copies for iterations.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* nd/retire-fnmatch (2013-01-01) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-07 at ab31f9b)

 A handful patches at the bottom have been moved to nd/wildmatch to
 graduate as part of that branch, before this series solidifies.

 Will cook in 'next' a bit longer than other topics.

* zk/clean-report-failure (2013-01-10) 2 commits
 - [SQUASH???] style fixes
 - git-clean: Display more accurate delete messages

 "git clean" states what it is going to remove and then goes on to
 remove it, but sometimes it only discovers things that cannot be
 removed after recursing into a directory, which makes the output
 confusing and even wrong.

 Will merge to 'next' after squashing the style fix in.


* mp/complete-paths (2013-01-11) 1 commit
 - git-completion.bash: add support for path completion

 The completion script used to let the default completer to suggest
 pathnames, which gave too many irrelevant choices (e.g. "git add"
 would not want to add an unmodified path).  Teach it to use a more
 git-aware logic to enumerate only relevant ones.

 Waiting for area-experts' help and review.
