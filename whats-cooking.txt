What's cooking in git.git (Aug 2014, #01; Fri, 1)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.

First release candidate 2.1.0-rc1 expected early next week, after
merging a couple of obvious documentation update patches.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* ep/avoid-test-a-o (2014-07-25) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-07-27 at 45de31d)
 + t9814: fix misconversion from test $a -o $b to test $a || test $b

 Fix a post v2.0 regression in 'master'.


* jk/more-push-completion (2014-07-22) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-07-28 at d1d4c27)
 + completion: complete `git push --force-with-lease=`
 + completion: add some missing options to `git push`
 + completion: complete "unstuck" `git push --recurse-submodules`


* sk/mingw-tests-workaround (2014-07-21) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-07-28 at 2f3b7ac)
 + t800[12]: work around MSys limitation
 + t9902: mingw-specific fix for gitfile link files
 + t4210: skip command-line encoding tests on mingw
 + MinGW: disable legacy encoding tests
 + t0110/MinGW: skip tests that pass arbitrary bytes on the command line
 + MinGW: Skip test redirecting to fd 4
 (this branch is used by jc/not-mingw-cygwin.)

 Make tests pass on msysgit by mostly disabling ones that are
 infeasible on that platform.


* sk/mingw-uni-fix-more (2014-07-21) 14 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-07-28 at 0945196)
 + Win32: enable color output in Windows cmd.exe
 + Win32: patch Windows environment on startup
 + Win32: keep the environment sorted
 + Win32: use low-level memory allocation during initialization
 + Win32: reduce environment array reallocations
 + Win32: don't copy the environment twice when spawning child processes
 + Win32: factor out environment block creation
 + Win32: unify environment function names
 + Win32: unify environment case-sensitivity
 + Win32: fix environment memory leaks
 + Win32: Unicode environment (incoming)
 + Win32: Unicode environment (outgoing)
 + Revert "Windows: teach getenv to do a case-sensitive search"
 + tests: do not pass iso8859-1 encoded parameter

 Most of these are battle-tested in msysgit and are needed to
 complete what has been merged to 'master' already.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* jk/stash-list-p (2014-07-30) 7 commits
 - SQUASH??? future-proof, log --cc should imply -p without being told
 - stash: show combined diff with "stash show"
 - stash: default listing to "--cc --simplify-combined-diff"
 - add --simplify-combined-diff option
 - pretty: make empty userformats truly empty
 - pretty: treat "--format=" as an empty userformat
 - revision: drop useless string offset when parsing "--pretty"

 Teach "git stash list -p" to DWIM to "git stash list -p --cc", with
 even nicer twist to collapse combined diff from identical two
 parents into a regular diff.


* pr/remotes-in-hashmap (2014-07-30) 1 commit
 - use a hashmap to make remotes faster

 Optimize remotes configuration look-up in a repository with very
 many remotes defined.


* rs/ref-transaction-multi (2014-07-31) 5 commits
 - refs.c: make the *_packed_refs functions static
 - refs.c: make repack_without_refs static
 - remote.c: use a transaction for deleting refs
 - refs.c: write updates to packed refs when a transaction has more than one ref
 - refs.c: move reflog updates into its own function
 (this branch uses rs/ref-transaction, rs/ref-transaction-1, rs/ref-transaction-reflog and rs/ref-transaction-rename.)

 Follow-up on rs/ref-transaction series to use the packed-ref to
 achieve atomicity when multiple refs are involved.


* rs/ref-transaction-rename (2014-07-31) 5 commits
 - refs.c: rollback the lockfile before we die() in repack_without_refs
 - refs.c: update rename_ref to use a transaction
 - refs.c: use packed refs when deleting refs during a transaction
 - refs.c: return error instead of dying when locking fails during transaction
 - refs.c: allow passing raw git_committer_info as email to _update_reflog
 (this branch is used by rs/ref-transaction-multi; uses rs/ref-transaction, rs/ref-transaction-1 and rs/ref-transaction-reflog.)

 Follow-up on rs/ref-transaction series to make renaming a ref
 transactional (i.e. "delete old and create new" should not leave
 an in-between state behind when it fails).


* ta/doc-config (2014-07-30) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-07-31 at ec577fa)
 + add documentation for writing config files

 - t9903: move test name prefix to a separate variable
 - t9903: put the Bash pc mode prompt test cases in a function
 - t9903: remove Zsh test from the suite of Bash prompt tests

 Expecting a reroll to limit the damage to test_eval_; also reported
 to be broken with older zsh that are still in the field ($gmane/251231).


* ss/userdiff-update-csharp-java (2014-06-02) 2 commits
 - userdiff: support Java try keyword
 - userdiff: support C# async methods and correct C# keywords

 Reviews sent; waiting for a response.

 Ejected from 'pu' to unclutter.
 Expecting a reroll.


* bg/rebase-off-of-previous-branch (2014-04-16) 1 commit
 - git-rebase: print name of rev when using shorthand

 Teach "git rebase -" to report the concrete name of the branch
 (i.e. the previous one).

 But it stops short and does not do the same for "git rebase @{-1}".
 Expecting a reroll.


* tr/merge-recursive-index-only (2014-02-05) 3 commits
 - merge-recursive: -Xindex-only to leave worktree unchanged
 - merge-recursive: internal flag to avoid touching the worktree

 . log --remerge-diff: show what the conflict resolution changed
 . name-hash: allow dir hashing even when !ignore_case
 . merge-recursive: allow storing conflict hunks in index
 . revision: fold all merge diff variants into an enum merge_diff_mode
 . combine-diff: do not pass revs->dense_combined_merges redundantly
 (this branch uses tr/merge-recursive-index-only.)

 "log -p" output learns a new way to let users inspect a merge
 commit by showing the differences between the automerged result
 with conflicts the person who recorded the merge would have seen
 and the final conflict resolution that was recorded in the merge.

 Needs to be rebased, now kb/fast-hashmap topic is in.


* jk/makefile (2014-02-05) 16 commits
 . FIXUP
 . move LESS/LV pager environment to Makefile
 . Makefile: teach scripts to include make variables
 . FIXUP
 . Makefile: auto-build C strings from make variables

 Simplify the Makefile rules and macros that exist primarily for
 quoting purposes, and make it easier to robustly express the
 dependency rules.

 Expecting a reroll.


* po/everyday-doc (2014-01-27) 1 commit
 - Make 'git help everyday' work

 This may make the said command to emit something, but the source is
 not meant to be formatted into a manual pages to begin with, and
 also its contents are a bit stale.  It may be a good first step in
 the right direction, but needs more work to at least get the
 mark-up right before public consumption.

 Will hold.


* rb/merge-prepare-commit-msg-hook (2014-01-10) 4 commits
 - merge: drop unused arg from abort_commit method signature
 - merge: make prepare_to_commit responsible for write_merge_state
 - t7505: ensure cleanup after hook blocks merge
 - t7505: add missing &&

 Expose more merge states (e.g. $GIT_DIR/MERGE_MODE) to hooks that
 run during "git merge".  The log message stresses too much on one
 hook, prepare-commit-msg, but it would equally apply to other hooks
 like post-merge, I think.

 Waiting for a reroll.


* jc/graph-post-root-gap (2013-12-30) 3 commits
 - WIP: document what we want at the end
 - graph: remove unused code a bit
 - graph: stuff the current commit into graph->columns[]

 This was primarily a RFH ($gmane/239580).


* tg/perf-lib-test-perf-cleanup (2013-09-19) 2 commits
 - perf-lib: add test_perf_cleanup target
 - perf-lib: split starting the test from the execution

 Add test_perf_cleanup shell function to the perf suite, that allows
 the script writers to define a test with a clean-up action.

 Will hold.


* jc/show-branch (2014-03-24) 5 commits
 - show-branch: use commit slab to represent bitflags of arbitrary width
 - show-branch.c: remove "all_mask"
 - show-branch.c: abstract out "flags" operation
 - show-branch.c: lift all_mask/all_revs to a global static
 - show-branch.c: update comment style

 Waiting for the final step to lift the hard-limit before sending it out.

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* mm/config-edit-global (2014-07-25) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-07-31 at ecce1c7)
 + commit: advertise config --global --edit on guessed identity
 + home_config_paths(): let the caller ignore xdg path
 + config --global --edit: create a template file if needed

 Start "git config --edit --global" from a skeletal per-user
 configuration file contents, instead of a total blank, when the
 user does not already have any.  This immediately reduces the need
 for a later "Have you forgotten setting core.user?" and we can add
 more to the template as we gain more experience.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* rs/init-no-duplicate-real-path (2014-07-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-07-31 at 683112e)

 - refs.c: add a new update_type field to ref_update
 - refs.c: rename the transaction functions
 - refs.c: make ref_transaction_delete a wrapper for ref_transaction_update
 - refs.c: make ref_transaction_create a wrapper to ref_transaction_update
 (this branch is used by rs/ref-transaction-multi and rs/ref-transaction-rename; uses rs/ref-transaction and rs/ref-transaction-1.)

 Cover updates to reflog with the same transaction mechanism as used
 for reflog manipulations.

* jc/not-mingw-cygwin (2014-07-21) 2 commits
 - test prerequisites: enumerate with commas
 - test prerequisites: eradicate NOT_FOO

 We have been using NOT_{MINGW,CYGWIN} test prerequisites long
 before Peff invented support for negated prerequisites e.g. !MINGW
 and we still add more uses of the former.  Convert them to the
 latter to avoid confusion.


* ta/config-set (2014-07-29) 2 commits
 - test-config: add tests for the config_set API
 - add `config_set` API for caching config-like files

 Add in-core caching layer to let us avoid reading the same
 configuration files number of times.

  (merged to 'next' on 2014-07-21 at 8277dc9)
 + lockfile: allow reopening a closed but still locked file

 Needed in the "commit -p" code path to update the cache tree in the
 index (e.g. for dt/cache-tree-repair topic).

 Will cook in 'next'.

 - tests: drop GIT_*_TIMING_TESTS environment variable support

 Test-script clean-up.

 Will hold.


* mt/patch-id-stable (2014-06-10) 1 commit
 - patch-id: change default to stable

 Teaches "git patch-id" to compute the patch ID that does not change
 when the files in a single patch is reordered. As this new algorithm
 is backward incompatible, the last bit to flip it to be the default
 is left out of 'master' for now.

 Will hold.

[Discarded]

* jh/submodule-tests (2014-04-17) 1 commit
