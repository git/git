What's cooking in git.git (Mar 2019, #02; Thu, 7)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

The maintenance track has been updated to preprare for 2.21.1.
Currently it only has the l10n updates (partly to unbreak builds
with certain versions of msgfmt in 2.21.0.  The tip of 'next' has
not been rewound yet.  This is a good time to fix a topic in 'next'
that has known "oops that was wrong" at the source, instead of
piling patches on top.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

[Graduated to "master"]

* ab/receive-pack-use-after-free-fix (2019-02-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-02-23 at 3f41dfe375)
 + receive-pack: fix use-after-free bug

 Memfix.


* aw/pretty-trailers (2019-01-29) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-02-06 at b7e5437702)
 + pretty: add support for separator option in %(trailers)
 + strbuf: separate callback for strbuf_expand:ing literals
 + pretty: add support for "valueonly" option in %(trailers)
 + pretty: allow showing specific trailers
 + pretty: single return path in %(trailers) handling
 + pretty: allow %(trailers) options with explicit value
 + doc: group pretty-format.txt placeholders descriptions

 The %(trailers) formatter in "git log --format=..."  now allows to
 optionally pick trailers selectively by keyword, show only values,
 etc.


* dl/complete-submodule-absorbgitdirs (2019-02-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-02-06 at c4e0cd535a)
 + completion: complete git submodule absorbgitdirs

 Command-line completion (in contrib/) learned to tab-complete the
 "git submodule absorbgitdirs" subcommand.


* dl/doc-submodule-wo-subcommand (2019-02-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-02-23 at 2f1c1428f1)

 Doc update.


* du/branch-show-current (2018-10-26) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-02-08 at e662ed4aee)
 + branch: introduce --show-current display option

 "git branch" learned a new subcommand "--show-current".


* en/combined-all-paths (2019-02-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-02-08 at 7057f38d6e)
 + log,diff-tree: add --combined-all-paths option

 Output from "diff --cc" did not show the original paths when the
 merge involved renames.  A new option adds the paths in the
 original trees to the output.


* en/merge-options-doc (2019-02-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-02-23 at 2eb5263dab)

 A more structured way to obtain execution trace has been added.


* jk/diff-no-index-initialize (2019-02-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-02-24 at f37a814eb0)
 + diff: reuse diff setup for --no-index case

 "git diff --no-index" may still want to access Git goodies like
 --ext-diff and --textconv, but so far these have been ignored,
 which has been corrected.


* jk/prune-optim (2019-02-14) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-02-23 at 7d03afc1c2)
 + t5304: rename "sha1" variables to "oid"
 + prune: check SEEN flag for reachability
 + prune: use bitmaps for reachability traversal
 + prune: lazily perform reachability traversal

 "git prune" has been taught to take advantage of reachability
 bitmap when able.


* jk/unused-params (2019-02-14) 10 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-02-23 at 9b715907a1)
 + ref-filter: drop unused "sz" parameters

 + diff: drop complete_rewrite parameter from run_external_diff()
 + diff: drop unused emit data parameter from sane_truncate_line()
 + diff: drop unused color reset parameters
 + diff: drop options parameter from diffcore_fix_diff_index()

 Code clean-up.


* js/doc-symref-in-proto-v1 (2019-02-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-02-21 at c7ca3bb974)
 + protocol-capabilities.txt: document symref

 Doc update.


* jt/http-auth-proto-v2-fix (2019-03-03) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-03-03 at d0fdc53f3a)
 + remote-curl: use post_rpc() for protocol v2 also
 + remote-curl: refactor reading into rpc_state's buf
 + remote-curl: reduce scope of rpc_state.result
 + remote-curl: reduce scope of rpc_state.stdin_preamble
 + remote-curl: reduce scope of rpc_state.argv

 Unify RPC code for smart http in protocol v0/v1 and v2, which fixes
 a bug in the latter (lack of authentication retry) and generally
 improves the code base.


* nd/completion-more-parameters (2019-02-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-02-23 at 23133710f7)
 + completion: add more parameter value completion

 The command line completion (in contrib/) has been taught to
 complete more subcommand parameters.


* nd/diff-parseopt (2019-01-27) 14 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-02-05 at 7c4b79aa79)
 + diff.c: convert --raw
 + diff.c: convert -W|--[no-]function-context
 + diff.c: convert -U|--unified
 + diff.c: convert -u|-p|--patch
 + diff.c: prepare to use parse_options() for parsing

 + parse-options: stop abusing 'callback' for lowlevel callbacks
 + parse-options: add OPT_BITOP()
 + parse-options: disable option abbreviation with PARSE_OPT_KEEP_UNKNOWN
 + parse-options: add one-shot mode
 + parse-options.h: remove extern on function prototypes
 (this branch is used by nd/diff-parseopt-2.)

 The diff machinery, one of the oldest parts of the system, which
 long predates the parse-options API, uses fairly long and complex
 handcrafted option parser.  This is being rewritten to use the
 parse-options API.


* nd/diff-parseopt-2 (2019-02-21) 21 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-02-23 at 6f11d0af54)

 API.


* nd/no-more-check-racy (2019-02-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-02-23 at eda76b8f46)
 + Delete check-racy.c

 Unused code removal.


* nd/split-index-null-base-fix (2019-02-13) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-02-13 at c404a19b7a)
 + read-cache.c: fix writing "link" index ext with null base oid

 Split-index fix.


* rd/doc-hook-used-in-sample (2019-02-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-02-23 at e521400a66)
 + mention use of "hooks.allownonascii" in "man githooks"

 Doc update.


* rj/prune-packed-excess-args (2019-02-11) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-02-13 at e026a2e7a7)
 + prune-packed: check for too many arguments

 "git prune-packed" did not notice and complain against excess
 arguments given from the command line, which now it does.


* sc/pack-redundant (2019-02-04) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-02-08 at ba3f8f0bc0)
 + pack-redundant: consistent sort method
 + pack-redundant: rename pack_list.all_objects
 + pack-redundant: new algorithm to find min packs
 + pack-redundant: delete redundant code
 + pack-redundant: delay creation of unique_objects
 + t5323: test cases for git-pack-redundant

 Update the implementation of pack-redundant for performance in a
 repository with many packfiles.


* tg/checkout-no-overlay (2019-02-04) 9 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-02-04 at 9968bcf4fb)
 + revert "checkout: introduce checkout.overlayMode config"
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-18 at 1e2a79ba5c)
 + checkout: introduce checkout.overlayMode config
 + checkout: introduce --{,no-}overlay option
 + checkout: factor out mark_cache_entry_for_checkout function
 + checkout: clarify comment
 + read-cache: add invalidate parameter to remove_marked_cache_entries
 + entry: support CE_WT_REMOVE flag in checkout_entry
 + entry: factor out unlink_entry function
 + move worktree tests to t24*

 "git checkout --no-overlay" can be used to trigger a new mode of
 checking out paths out of the tree-ish, that allows paths that
 match the pathspec that are in the current index and working tree
 and are not in the tree-ish.


* wh/author-committer-ident-config (2019-02-04) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-02-06 at 6ab8bfa199)
 + config: allow giving separate author and committer idents

 Four new configuration variables {author,committer}.{name,email}
 have been introduced to override user.{name,email} in more specific
 cases.

* rj/hdr-check-gcrypt-fix (2019-03-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-03-07 at ef95cd3878)
 + Makefile: fix 'hdr-check' when GCRYPT not installed

 The set of header files used by "make hdr-check" unconditionally
 included sha256/gcrypt.h, even when it is not used, causing the
 make target to fail.  We now skip it when GCRYPT_SHA256 is not in
 use.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* br/commit-tree-parseopt (2019-03-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-03-07 at d415328f75)
 + commit-tree: utilize parse-options api

 The command line parser of "git commit-tree" has been rewritten to
 use the parse-options API.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/config-type-color-ends-with-lf (2019-03-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-03-07 at 11bedec388)
 + config: document --type=color output is a complete line

 "git config --type=color ..." is meant to replace "git config --get-color"
 but there is a slight difference that wasn't documented, which is
 now fixed.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/guard-bswap-header (2019-03-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-03-07 at 8ba06b29d4)
 + compat/bswap: add include header guards

 The include file compat/bswap.h has been updated so that it is safe
 to (accidentally) include it more than once.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* js/remote-curl-i18n (2019-03-06) 1 commit
 - remote-curl: mark all error messages for translation
 (this branch uses js/anonymize-remote-curl-diag.)

 Error messages given from the http transport have been updated so
 that they can be localized.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ma/asciidoctor-fixes-more (2019-03-07) 5 commits
 - Documentation: turn middle-of-line tabs into spaces
 - git-svn.txt: drop escaping '\' that ends up being rendered
 - git.txt: remove empty line before list continuation
 - config/fsck.txt: avoid starting line with dash
 - config/diff.txt: drop spurious backtick

 Documentation mark-up fixes.

* ds/midx-expire-repack (2019-01-27) 10 commits
 - midx: add test that 'expire' respects .keep files
 - multi-pack-index: test expire while adding packs
 - midx: implement midx_repack()
 - multi-pack-index: prepare 'repack' subcommand
 - multi-pack-index: implement 'expire' subcommand

 - multi-pack-index: prepare for 'expire' subcommand
 - Docs: rearrange subcommands for multi-pack-index
 - repack: refactor pack deletion for future use

 "git multi-pack-index expire/repack" are new subcommands that
 consult midx file and are used to drop unused pack files and
 coalesce small pack files that are still in use.

 Comments?


* js/protocol-advertise-multi (2018-12-28) 1 commit
 - protocol: advertise multiple supported versions

 The transport layer has been updated so that the protocol version
 used can be negotiated between the parties, by the initiator
 listing the protocol versions it is willing to talk, and the other
 side choosing from one of them.

 Expecting a reroll.

* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2018-10-15) 1 commit
 - zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".


* dl/remote-save-to-push (2018-12-11) 1 commit
 - remote: add --save-to-push option to git remote set-url

 "git remote set-url" learned a new option that moves existing value
 of the URL field to pushURL field of the remote before replacing
 the URL field with a new value.

 Anybody who wants to champion this topic?
 I am personally not yet quite convinced if this is worth pursuing.


* pw/add-p-select (2018-07-26) 4 commits
 - add -p: optimize line selection for short hunks
 - add -p: allow line selection to be inverted
 - add -p: select modified lines correctly
 - add -p: select individual hunk lines

 "git add -p" interactive interface learned to let users choose
 individual added/removed lines to be used in the operation, instead
 of accepting or rejecting a whole hunk.

 Will discard.
 No further feedbacks on the topic for quite some time.

 cf. <d622a95b-7302-43d4-4ec9-b2cf3388c653@talktalk.net>
 I found the feature to be hard to explain, and may result in more
 end-user complaints, but let's see.


* nb/branch-show-other-worktrees-head (2019-02-01) 3 commits
 - branch: add an extra verbose output displaying worktree path for refs checked out in a linked worktree
 - branch: mark and color a branch differently if it is checked out in a linked worktree
 - ref-filter: add worktreepath atom

 "git branch --list" learned to show branches that are checked out
 in other worktrees connected to the same repository prefixed with
 '+', similar to the way the currently checked out branch is shown
 with '*' in front.

 The top one probably deserves retitling.
 The second one is of dubious value, but if we are keeping it, 
 it should also be retitled.

* jt/test-protocol-version (2019-03-07) 8 commits
 - t5552: compensate for v2 filtering ref adv.
 - tests: fix protocol version for overspecifications
 - t5700: only run with protocol version 1
 - t5512: compensate for v0 only sending HEAD symrefs
 - t5503: fix overspecification of trace expectation
 - tests: always test fetch of unreachable with v0
 - t5601: check ssh command only with protocol v0

 different versions of over-the-wire protocols.


* jk/bisect-final-output (2019-03-01) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-03-07 at 1d429b237a)
 + bisect: make diff-tree output prettier
 + bisect: fix internal diff-tree config loading
 + bisect: use string arguments to feed internal diff-tree

 The final report from "git bisect" used to show the suspected
 culprit using a raw "diff-tree", with which there is no output for
 a merge commit.  This has been updated to use a more modern and
 human readable output that still is concise enough.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/fsck-doc (2019-03-05) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-03-07 at 7826e889a6)
 + fsck: always compute USED flags for unreachable objects
 + doc/fsck: clarify --connectivity-only behavior

 "git fsck --connectivity-only" omits computation necessary to sift
 the objects that are not reachable from any of the refs into
 unreachable and dangling.  This is now enabled when dangling
 objects are requested (which is done by default, but can be
 overridden with the "--no-dangling" option).

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/no-sigpipe-during-network-transport (2019-03-05) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-03-07 at 59fe6aa5ac)
 + fetch: ignore SIGPIPE during network operation
 + fetch: avoid calling write_or_die()

 On platforms where "git fetch" is killed with SIGPIPE (e.g. OSX),
 the upload-pack that runs on the other end that hangs up after
 detecting an error could cause "git fetch" to die with a signal,
 which led to a flakey test.  "git fetch" now ignores SIGPIPE during
 the network portion of its operation (this is not a problem as we
 check the return status from our write(2)s).

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/virtual-objects-do-exist (2019-03-05) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-03-07 at d6937e8e46)
 + rev-list: allow cached objects in existence check

 A recent update broke "is this object available to us?" check for
 well-known objects like an empty tree (which should yield "yes",
 even when there is no on-disk object for an empty tree), which has
 been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* js/anonymize-remote-curl-diag (2019-03-05) 1 commit
 - curl: anonymize URLs in error messages and warnings
 (this branch is used by js/remote-curl-i18n.)

 remote-http transport did not anonymize URLs reported in its error
 messages at places.

 Will merge to 'next' the bottom one.
 The i18n of die() messages conflicts with topics in flight, so will
 be dealt with separately when the tree is more quiescent.


* js/find-lib-h-with-ls-files-when-possible (2019-03-05) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-03-07 at 0572e4704c)
 + Makefile: use `git ls-files` to list header files, if possible

 The Makefile uses 'find' utility to enumerate all the *.h header
 files, which is expensive on platforms with slow filesystems; it
 now optionally uses "ls-files" if working within a repository,
 which is a trick similar to how all sources are enumerated to run
 ETAGS on.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* js/rebase-orig-head-fix (2019-03-04) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-03-07 at f805f820b4)
 + built-in rebase: set ORIG_HEAD just once, before the rebase
 + built-in rebase: demonstrate that ORIG_HEAD is not set correctly
 + built-in rebase: use the correct reflog when switching branches
 + built-in rebase: no need to check out `onto` twice

 "git rebase" that was reimplemented in C did not set ORIG_HEAD
 correctly, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* js/rebase-recreate-merge (2019-03-01) 1 commit

* nd/worktree-name-sanitization (2019-03-07) 2 commits
 - worktree add: sanitize worktree names
 - refs.c: refactor check_refname_component()

 In recent versions of Git, per-worktree refs are exposed in
 refs/worktrees/<wtname>/ hierarchy, which means that worktree names
 must be a valid refname component.  The code now sanitizes the names
 given to worktrees, to make sure these refs are not malforked.

  (merged to 'next' on 2019-02-23 at 70cc07cebe)
 + read-cache: add post-index-change hook

 A new hook "post-index-change" is called when the on-disk index
 file changes, which can help e.g. a virtualized working tree
 implementation.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* jc/format-patch-error-check (2019-02-22) 3 commits
 - format-patch: --no-clobber refrains from overwriting output files
 - format-patch: notice failure to open cover letter for writing
 - builtin/log: downcase the beginning of error messages

 "git format-patch" used overwrite an existing patch/cover-letter
 file.  A new "--no-clobber" option stops it.

 Will merge to 'next' after dropping the tip commit.
 I think the bottom two were indenendently good changes; the top one
 was met with "Meh" by reviewer(s), and I tend to agree.


* ab/makefile-help-devs-more (2019-02-24) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-03-07 at fa05e1a2ae)
 + Makefile: allow for combining DEVELOPER=1 and CFLAGS="..."
 + Makefile: move the setting of *FLAGS closer to "include"
 + Makefile: Move *_LIBS assignment into its own section
 + Makefile: add/remove comments at top and tweak whitespace
 + Makefile: move "strip" assignment down from flags
 + Makefile: remove an out-of-date comment

 CFLAGS now can be tweaked when invoking Make while using
 DEVELOPER=YesPlease; this did not work well before.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* jt/fetch-cdn-offload (2019-03-01) 9 commits
 - fixup! upload-pack: refactor reading of pack-objects out
 - SQUASH???
 - upload-pack: send part of packfile response as uri
 - upload-pack: refactor reading of pack-objects out
 - Documentation: add Packfile URIs design doc
 - Documentation: order protocol v2 sections
 - http-fetch: support fetching packfiles by URL
 - http: improve documentation of http_pack_request
 - http: use --stdin and --keep when downloading pack

 WIP for allowing a response to "git fetch" to instruct the bulk of
 the pack contents to be instead taken from elsewhere (aka CDN).


* dl/submodule-set-branch (2019-02-08) 3 commits
 - submodule: teach set-branch subcommand
 - submodule--helper: teach config subcommand --unset
 - git-submodule.txt: "--branch <branch>" option defaults to 'master'

 "git submodule" learns "set-branch" subcommand that allows the
 submodule.*.branch settings to be modified.

 Need to attach sign-off; other than that it seems OK to be in 'next'.


* dm/some-stdio-functions-are-macro-on-freebsd (2019-02-01) 1 commit
 - http: cast result to FILE *

 Variants of BSD define fileno(fh) as a macro, breaking a program
 that passes a "void *" to it.

 Expecting a reroll.

 - blame: add a config option to mark ignored lines
 - blame: add the ability to ignore commits and their changes
 - blame: use a helper function in blame_chunk()

  (merged to 'next' on 2019-02-06 at f4fe5d759a)
 + merge: add scissors line on merge conflict
 + merge: cleanup messages like commit
 + t7600: clean up 'merge --squash c3 with c7' test
 + commit: extract cleanup_mode functions to sequencer

 The list of conflicted paths shown in the editor while concluding a
 conflicted merge was shown above the scissors line when the
 clean-up mode is set to "scissors", even though it was commented
 out just like the list of updated paths and other information to
 help the user explain the merge better.

 Hold to replace or fixup.

* jn/unknown-index-extensions (2018-11-21) 2 commits
 - index: offer advice for unknown index extensions

 A bit too alarming warning given when unknown index extensions
 exist is getting revamped.

 Expecting a reroll.


* ag/sequencer-reduce-rewriting-todo (2019-03-07) 18 commits
 - rebase--interactive: move transform_todo_file()
 - sequencer: use edit_todo_list() in complete_action()
 - rebase-interactive: rewrite edit_todo_list() to handle the initial edit
 - rebase-interactive: append_todo_help() changes
 - rebase-interactive: use todo_list_write_to_file() in edit_todo_list()
 - sequencer: refactor skip_unnecessary_picks() to work on a todo_list
 - rebase--interactive: move rearrange_squash_in_todo_file()
 - rebase--interactive: move sequencer_add_exec_commands()
 - sequencer: change complete_action() to use the refactored functions
 - sequencer: make sequencer_make_script() write its script to a strbuf
 - sequencer: refactor rearrange_squash() to work on a todo_list
 - sequencer: refactor sequencer_add_exec_commands() to work on a todo_list
 - sequencer: refactor check_todo_list() to work on a todo_list

 - sequencer: refactor transform_todos() to work on a todo_list
 - sequencer: remove the 'arg' field from todo_item
 - sequencer: make the todo_list structure public
 - sequencer: changes in parse_insn_buffer()

 The scripted version of "git rebase -i" wrote and rewrote the todo
 list many times during a single step of its operation, and the
 recent C-rewrite made a faithful conversion of the logic to C.  The
 implementation has been updated to carry necessary information
 around in-core to avoid rewriting the same file over and over
 unnecessarily.
