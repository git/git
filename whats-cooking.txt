What's cooking in git.git (Oct 2024, #10; Tue, 22)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and
aren't considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL
to a message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity (of course they can be resubmit when new interests
arise).

This is the third integration round from the interim maintainer. A
couple of topics have graduated from 'next', and there are 10 topics
in 'next' that should graduate before the next integration round. As
last time, there are still a large handful of topics are awaiting
review or discussion, so please take a look at those marked as such
below.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	https://github.com/git/git/

(Note that other usual spots are not updated while Junio is on
vacation, including the below):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-scm/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/ttaylorr/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/

* cw/worktree-relative (2024-10-08) 4 commits
 (merged to 'next' on 2024-10-18 at efc01c616e)
 + worktree: add test for path handling in linked worktrees
 + worktree: link worktrees with relative paths
 + worktree: refactor infer_backlink() to use *strbuf
 + Merge branch 'es/worktree-repair-copied' into cw/worktrees-relative
 (this branch uses es/worktree-repair-copied.)

 An extra worktree attached to a repository points at each other to
 allow finding the repository from the worktree and vice versa
 possible.  Turn this linkage to relative paths.

* es/worktree-repair-copied (2024-09-23) 1 commit
 + worktree: repair copied repository and linked worktrees
 (this branch is used by cw/worktree-relative.)

 The heuristics in "git worktree repair" can be confused when et
 worktree and its repository are copied and break correctly
 configured worktree and repository that point at each other, which
 has been corrected.

 + cache-tree: detect mismatching number of index entries

 Fail gracefully instead of crashing when attempting to write the
 contents of a corrupt in-core index as a tree object.

 + archive: remove the_repository global variable
 + annotate: remove usage of the_repository global
 + git: pass in repo to builtin based on setup_git_directory_gently

 Commands that can also work outside Git have learned to take the
 repository instance "repo" when we know we are in a repository, and
 NULL when we are not, in a parameter.  The uses of the_repository
 variable in a few of them have been removed using the new calling
 convention.

 Will merge to 'master'.

* ej/cat-file-remote-object-info (2024-09-27) 6 commits
 - cat-file: add remote-object-info to batch-command
 - cat-file: add declaration of variable i inside its for loop
 - transport: add client support for object-info
 - serve: advertise object-info feature
 - fetch-pack: move fetch initialization
 - fetch-pack: refactor packet writing

 "git cat-file --batch" and friends can optionally ask a remote
 server about objects it does not have.

 Needs review.

* cw/fix-reachable-in-repo-with-promisor (2024-09-19) 2 commits
 - fetch-pack.c: do not declare local commits as "have" in partial repos
 - packfile: split promisor objects oidset into two

 "git gc" in a partial clone (i.e. lacking objects that can be
 lazily fetched from promisor remotes) collected more than objects
 that promisor-remote can give.

 Needs review.

* jc/strbuf-commented-something (2024-09-12) 2 commits
 - strbuf: retire strbuf_commented_lines()
 - strbuf: retire strbuf_commented_addf()

 Update two functions whose callers always pass the same global
 variable to omit the redundant parameter and use the global in the
 callee themselves.

 On hold.

* cc/promisor-remote-capability (2024-09-10) 4 commits
 - promisor-remote: check advertised name or URL
 - Add 'promisor-remote' capability to protocol v2
 - strbuf: refactor strbuf_trim_trailing_ch()
 - version: refactor strbuf_sanitize()

 The v2 protocol learned to allow the server to advertise possible
 promisor remotes, and the client to respond with what promissor
 remotes it uses, so that the server side can omit objects that the
 client can lazily obtain from these other promissor remotes.

 Comments?  I got an impression that this is premature without
 finishing the discussion on a larger picture.

* sj/ref-contents-check (2024-10-21) 9 commits
 - ref: add symlink ref content check for files backend
 - ref: check whether the target of the symref is a ref
 - ref: add basic symref content check for files backend
 - ref: add more strict checks for regular refs
 - ref: port git-fsck(1) regular refs check for files backend
 - ref: support multiple worktrees check for refs
 - ref: initialize target name outside of check functions
 - ref: check the full refname instead of basename
 - ref: initialize "fsck_ref_report" with zero

 "git fsck" learned to issue warnings on "curiously formatted" ref
 contents that have always been taken valid but something Git
 wouldn't have written itself (e.g., missing terminating end-of-line
 after the full object name).

 Needs review.
