What's cooking in git.git (Sep 2024, #09; Mon, 23)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and
aren't considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL
to a message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity (of course they can be resubmit when new interests
arise).

A bit more topics that have already graduated to 'master' have been
merged down to 'maint' and Git 2.46.2 has been tagged.  Since many
people were out last week, not many topics have moved.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-scm/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

Release tarballs are available at:

 Background tasks "git maintenance" runs may need to use credential
 information when going over the network, but a credential helper
 may work only in an interactive environment, and end up blocking a
 scheduled task waiting for UI.  Credential helpers can now behave
 differently when they are not running interactively.

 When a subprocess to work in a submodule spawned by "git submodule"
 fails with SIGPIPE, the parent Git process caught the death of it,
 but gave a generic "failed to work in that submodule", which was
 misleading.  We now behave as if the parent got SIGPIPE and die.

 "git apply" had custom buffer management code that predated before
 use of strbuf got widespread, which has been updated to use strbuf,
 which also plugged some memory leaks.

 - promisor-remote: check advertised name or URL
 - Add 'promisor-remote' capability to protocol v2
 - strbuf: refactor strbuf_trim_trailing_ch()
 - version: refactor strbuf_sanitize()

 The v2 protocol learned to allow the server to advertise possible
 promisor remotes, and the client to respond with what promissor
 remotes it uses, so that the server side can omit objects that the
 client can lazily obtain from these other promissor remotes.

 - git-repack: update usage to match docs
 - pack-objects: add GIT_TEST_FULL_NAME_HASH
 - repack: test --full-name-hash option
 - pack-objects: add --full-name-hash option

 In a repository with too many (more than --window size) similarly
 named files, "git repack" would not find good delta-base candidate
 and worse, it may not use a blob from exactly the same path as a
 good delta-base candidate.  Optionally replace the name hash so
 that only blobs at the same path and nothing else are used as
 delta-base candidate.
