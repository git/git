What's cooking in git.git (Jan 2019, #04; Mon, 28)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------

* br/commit-tree-fully-spelled-gpg-sign-option (2019-01-22) 2 commits
 - commit-tree: add missing --gpg-sign flag
 - t7510: invoke git as part of &&-chain

 The documentation of "git commit-tree" said that the command
 understands "--gpg-sign" in addition to "-S", but the command line
 parser did not know about the longhand, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* pw/rebase-x-sanity-check (2019-01-28) 1 commit

* ab/commit-graph-write-optim (2019-01-22) 1 commit
 - commit-graph write: use pack order when finding commits
 (this branch is used by ab/commit-graph-write-progress and ds/commit-graph-format-v2.)

 The codepath to write out commit-graph has been optimized by
 following the usual pattern of visiting objects in in-pack order.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ab/commit-graph-write-progress (2019-01-23) 9 commits
 - commit-graph write: emit a percentage for all progress
 - commit-graph write: add itermediate progress
 - commit-graph write: remove empty line for readability

 - commit-graph: don't call write_graph_chunk_extra_edges() unnecessarily
 - commit-graph: rename "large edges" to "extra edges"
 (this branch is used by ds/commit-graph-format-v2; uses ab/commit-graph-write-optim.)

 The codepath to show progress meter while writing out commit-graph
 file has been improved.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* cc/test-ref-store-typofix (2019-01-17) 1 commit
 - helper/test-ref-store: fix "new-sha1" vs "old-sha1" typo

 An obvious typo in an assersion error message has been fixed.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/add-ignore-errors-bit-assignment-fix (2019-01-17) 1 commit
 - add: use separate ADD_CACHE_RENORMALIZE flag

 "git add --ignore-errors" did not work as advertised and instead
 worked as an unintended synonym for "git add --renormalize", which
 has been fixed.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* js/mingw-unc-path-w-backslashes (2019-01-18) 2 commits
 - mingw: special-case arguments to `sh`
 - mingw (t5580): document bug when cloning from backslashed UNC paths

 In Git for Windows, "git clone \\server\share\path" etc. that uses
 UNC paths from command line had bad interaction with its shell
 emulation.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* js/t6042-timing-fix (2019-01-17) 1 commit
 - t6042: work around speed optimization on Windows

 Test update.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 - ls-refs: filter refs using namespace-stripped name

 Fix namespace support in protocol v2.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* bp/checkout-new-branch-optim (2019-01-23) 2 commits
 - checkout: fix regression in checkout -b on intitial checkout
 - checkout: add test demonstrating regression with checkout -b on initial commit

 "git checkout -b <new> [HEAD]" to create a new branch from the
 current commit and check it out ought to be a no-op in the index
 and the working tree in normal cases, but there are corner cases
 that does require updates to the index and the working tree.
 Running it immediately after "git clone --no-checkout" is one of
 these cases that an earlier optimization kicked in incorrectly,
 which has been fixed.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* br/blame-ignore (2019-01-18) 3 commits
 - blame: add a config option to mark ignored lines
 - blame: add the ability to ignore commits and their changes
 - Move init_skiplist() outside of fsck

 effects (as well as their presence) get ignored.


* js/abspath-part-inside-repo (2019-01-18) 1 commit
 - abspath_part_inside_repo: respect core.ignoreCase

 On a case-insensntive filesystem, we failed to compare the part of
 the path that is above the worktree directory in an absolute
 pathname, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 - parse-options: add one-shot mode
 - parse-options.h: remove extern on function prototypes

 The diff machinery, one of the oldest parts of the system, which
 long predates the parse-options API, uses fairly long and complex
 handcrafted option parser.  This is being rewritten to use the
 parse-options API.

 - pack-redundant: consistent sort method
 - pack-redundant: rename pack_list.all_objects

  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-18 at 6714547e6d)
 + filter-options: expand scaled numbers
 (this branch uses md/list-objects-filter-by-depth and sb/more-repo-in-api; is tangled with jt/get-reference-with-commit-graph.)

 Update the protocol message specification to allow only the limited
 use of scaled quantities.  This is ensure potential compatibility
 issues will not go out of hand.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 + merge-recursive: copy $GITHEAD strings
 + init: make a copy of $GIT_DIR string
 + config: make a copy of $GIT_CONFIG string
 + commit: copy saved getenv() result
 + get_super_prefix(): copy getenv() result

 There were many places the code relied on the string returned from

 corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 "git p4" failed to update a shelved change when there were moved
 files, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ma/clear-repository-format (2019-01-23) 2 commits
 - setup: fix memory leaks with `struct repository_format`
 - setup: free old value before setting `work_tree`

 The setup code has been cleaned up to avoid leaks around the
 repository_format structure.

 cf. <20190124001450.GR423984@genre.crustytoothpaste.net>

 The assumption to work on the single "in-core index" instance has
 been reduced from the library-ish part of the codebase.

 This obviously has fallouts with a few topics in flight, but
 otherwise it seemed to be in good enough shape.


* bc/tree-walk-oid (2019-01-15) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-18 at 60c38b9e4a)
 + cache: make oidcpy always copy GIT_MAX_RAWSZ bytes

  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-18 at 9ea7fc4b49)
 + add --edit: truncate the patch file

 "git add -e" got confused when the change it wants to let the user
 edit is smaller than the previous change that was left over in a
 temporary file.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 - built-in rebase: call `git am` directly
 - rebase: teach `reset_head()` to optionally skip the worktree
 - rebase: avoid double reflog entry when switching branches
 - rebase: move `reset_head()` into a better spot

 Instead of going through "git-rebase--am" scriptlet to use the "am"
 backend, the built-in version of "git rebase" learned to drive the
 "am" backend directly.

 Waiting for a review response.
 Looked almost ready.


* ms/packet-err-check (2019-01-02) 2 commits
 - pack-protocol.txt: accept error packets in any context
 - Use packet_reader instead of packet_read_line
 (this branch is used by jt/fetch-v2-sideband.)

 Error checking of data sent over the pack-protocol has been
 revamped so that error packets are always diagnosed properly.

 + rebase: run post-checkout hook on checkout
 + t5403: simplify by using a single repository

 "git rebase" internally runs "checkout" to switch between branches,
 and the command used to call the post-checkout hook, but the
 reimplementation stopped doing so, which is getting fixed.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ms/http-no-more-failonerror (2019-01-10) 5 commits

 "--date=auto" can be used to use this new format when the output is
 goint to the pager or to the terminal and otherwise the default
 format.

 - pack-objects: create GIT_TEST_PACK_SPARSE
 - pack-objects: create pack.useSparse setting
 - revision: implement sparse algorithm

 traversal cost to favor small pushes.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* js/rebase-i-redo-exec (2018-12-11) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-18 at 71be3fedb7)
 + rebase: introduce a shortcut for --reschedule-failed-exec
 + rebase: add a config option to default to --reschedule-failed-exec
 + rebase: introduce --reschedule-failed-exec

 "git rebase -i" learned to re-execute a command given with 'exec'
 to run after it failed the last time.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* md/list-objects-filter-by-depth (2019-01-15) 4 commits
 + tree:<depth>: skip some trees even when collecting omits
 + list-objects-filter: teach tree:# how to handle >0
 + Merge branch 'nd/the-index' into md/list-objects-filter-by-depth
 + Merge branch 'sb/more-repo-in-api' into md/list-objects-filter-by-depth
 (this branch is used by js/filter-options-should-use-plain-int; uses sb/more-repo-in-api; is tangled with jt/get-reference-with-commit-graph.)

 The objects-filter machinery learned "tree:<depth>" to filter
 objects up to a given depth; earlier it only supported depth=0,
 i.e. usable to create a commit-only lazy clone.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* tg/checkout-no-overlay (2019-01-08) 8 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-18 at 1e2a79ba5c)
 + checkout: introduce checkout.overlayMode config
 + checkout: introduce --{,no-}overlay option
 + checkout: factor out mark_cache_entry_for_checkout function
 + checkout: clarify comment
 + read-cache: add invalidate parameter to remove_marked_cache_entries
 + entry: support CE_WT_REMOVE flag in checkout_entry
 + entry: factor out unlink_entry function
 + move worktree tests to t24*

 "git checkout --no-overlay" can be used to trigger a new mode of
 checking out paths out of the tree-ish, that allows paths that
 match the pathspec that are in the current index and working tree
 and are not in the tree-ish.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/proto-v2-hidden-refs-fix (2019-01-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-18 at 875dbbc71f)
 + upload-pack: support hidden refs with protocol v2

 The v2 upload-pack protocol implementation failed to honor
 hidden-ref configuration, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.
 An earlier attempt reverted out of 'next'.


* js/commit-graph-chunk-table-fix (2019-01-15) 3 commits
 - Makefile: correct example fuzz build
 - commit-graph: fix buffer read-overflow
 - commit-graph, fuzz: add fuzzer for commit-graph

 The codepath to read from the commit-graph file attempted to read
 past the end of it when the file's table-of-contents was corrupt.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jt/get-reference-with-commit-graph (2018-12-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-18 at bfc4eb9411)
 + revision: use commit graph in get_reference()
 (this branch uses sb/more-repo-in-api; is tangled with js/filter-options-should-use-plain-int and md/list-objects-filter-by-depth.)

 Micro-optimize the code that prepares commit objects to be walked
 by "git rev-list" when the commit-graph is available.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* dl/merge-cleanup-scissors-fix (2019-01-27) 5 commits
 - init docs: correct a punctuation typo
 - merge: add scissors line on merge conflict
 - merge: cleanup messages like commit
 - t7600: clean up 'merge --squash c3 with c7' test
 - commit: extract cleanup_mode functions to sequencer

 The list of conflicted paths shown in the editor while concluding a
 conflicted merge was shown above the scissors line when the
 clean-up mode is set to "scissors", even though it was commented
 out just like the list of updated paths and other information to
 help the user explain the merge better.


* aw/pretty-trailers (2018-12-09) 7 commits
 - pretty: add support for separator option in %(trailers)
 - strbuf: separate callback for strbuf_expand:ing literals
 - pretty: add support for "valueonly" option in %(trailers)
 - pretty: allow showing specific trailers
 - pretty: single return path in %(trailers) handling
 - pretty: allow %(trailers) options with explicit value
 - doc: group pretty-format.txt placeholders descriptions

 The %(trailers) formatter in "git log --format=..."  now allows to
 optionally pick trailers selectively by keyword, show only values,
 etc.

 How's the doneness of this one?


* jn/unknown-index-extensions (2018-11-21) 2 commits
 - index: offer advice for unknown index extensions
 - index: do not warn about unrecognized extensions

 A bit too alarming warning given when unknown index extensions
 exist is getting revamped.

 Expecting a reroll.


* en/rebase-merge-on-sequencer (2019-01-07) 8 commits
 - rebase: implement --merge via the interactive machinery
 - rebase: define linearization ordering and enforce it
 - git-legacy-rebase: simplify unnecessary triply-nested if
 - git-rebase, sequencer: extend --quiet option for the interactive machinery
 - am, rebase--merge: do not overlook --skip'ed commits with post-rewrite
 - t5407: add a test demonstrating how interactive handles --skip differently
 - rebase: fix incompatible options error message
 - rebase: make builtin and legacy script error messages the same

 "git rebase --merge" as been reimplemented by reusing the internal
 machinery used for "git rebase -i".

 On hold.

* dl/remote-save-to-push (2018-12-11) 1 commit
 - remote: add --save-to-push option to git remote set-url

 "git remote set-url" learned a new option that moves existing value
 of the URL field to pushURL field of the remote before replacing
 the URL field with a new value.

 I am personally not yet quite convinced if this is worth pursuing.


* js/protocol-advertise-multi (2018-12-28) 1 commit
 - protocol: advertise multiple supported versions

 The transport layer has been updated so that the protocol version
 used can be negotiated between the parties, by the initiator
 listing the protocol versions it is willing to talk, and the other
 side choosing from one of them.


* js/smart-http-detect-remote-error (2019-01-07) 3 commits
 - remote-curl: die on server-side errors
 - remote-curl: tighten "version 2" check for smart-http
 - remote-curl: refactor smart-http discovery

 Some errors from the other side coming over smart HTTP transport
 were not noticed, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* nb/branch-show-other-worktrees-head (2019-01-23) 3 commits
 - branch: add an extra verbose output displaying worktree path for refs checked out in a linked worktree
 - branch: mark and color a branch differently if it is checked out in a linked worktree
 - ref-filter: add worktreepath atom

 "git branch --list" learned to show branches that are checked out
 in other worktrees connected to the same repository prefixed with
 '+', similar to the way the currently checked out branch is shown
 with '*' in front.

 The second one is of dubious value.  Needs sign-off.


* sb/more-repo-in-api (2018-12-28) 23 commits
 + t/helper/test-repository: celebrate independence from the_repository
 + path.h: make REPO_GIT_PATH_FUNC repository agnostic

 + sha1_file: allow read_object to read objects in arbitrary repositories
 (this branch is used by js/filter-options-should-use-plain-int, jt/get-reference-with-commit-graph and md/list-objects-filter-by-depth.)

 The in-core repository instances are passed through more codepaths.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* bc/sha-256 (2018-11-14) 12 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-18 at 3f161d31bb)
 + hash: add an SHA-256 implementation using OpenSSL

 + cache: make hashcmp and hasheq work with larger hashes
 + hex: introduce functions to print arbitrary hashes
 + sha1-file: provide functions to look up hash algorithms
 + sha1-file: rename algorithm to "sha1"
 (this branch is used by ds/commit-graph-format-v2.)

 Add sha-256 hash and plug it through the code to allow building Git
 with the "NewHash".

 Will merge to 'master'.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* du/branch-show-current (2018-10-26) 1 commit
 - branch: introduce --show-current display option

 "git branch" learned a new subcommand "--show-current".

 I am personally not yet quite convinced if this is worth pursuing.


* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2018-10-15) 1 commit
 - zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".


* ag/sequencer-reduce-rewriting-todo (2019-01-14) 18 commits
 - rebase-interactive.h: fix hdr-check warnings
 - sequencer: mark file local symbols as static
 - rebase-interactive: move transform_todo_file() to rebase--interactive.c
 - sequencer: use edit_todo_list() in complete_action()
 - rebase-interactive: rewrite edit_todo_list() to handle the initial edit
 - rebase-interactive: append_todo_help() changes
 - rebase-interactive: use todo_list_write_to_file() in edit_todo_list()
 - sequencer: refactor skip_unnecessary_picks() to work on a todo_list
 - sequencer: change complete_action() to use the refactored functions
 - sequencer: make sequencer_make_script() write its script to a strbuf
 - sequencer: refactor rearrange_squash() to work on a todo_list
 - sequencer: refactor sequencer_add_exec_commands() to work on a todo_list
 - sequencer: refactor check_todo_list() to work on a todo_list
 - sequencer: introduce todo_list_write_to_file()
 - sequencer: refactor transform_todos() to work on a todo_list
 - sequencer: remove the 'arg' field from todo_item
 - sequencer: make the todo_list structure public
 - sequencer: changes in parse_insn_buffer()

 The scripted version of "git rebase -i" wrote and rewrote the todo
 list many times during a single step of its operation, and the
 recent C-rewrite made a faithful conversion of the logic to C.  The
 implementation has been updated to carry necessary information
 around in-core to avoid rewriting the same file over and over
 unnecessarily.

 May need a further update, including squashing the tip commit to a
 releavant place.


* sb/submodule-recursive-fetch-gets-the-tip (2018-12-09) 9 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-18 at 79a2809fbc)

 "git fetch --recurse-submodules" may not fetch the necessary commit
 that is bound to the superproject, which is getting corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* js/add-i-coalesce-after-editing-hunk (2018-08-28) 1 commit
 - add -p: coalesce hunks before testing applicability

 Applicability check after a patch is edited in a "git add -i/p"
 session has been improved.

 Will hold.
 cf. <e5b2900a-0558-d3bf-8ea1-d526b078bbc2@talktalk.net>

 "git stash" rewritten in C.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* pw/add-p-select (2018-07-26) 4 commits
 - add -p: optimize line selection for short hunks
 - add -p: allow line selection to be inverted
 - add -p: select modified lines correctly
 - add -p: select individual hunk lines

 "git add -p" interactive interface learned to let users choose
 individual added/removed lines to be used in the operation, instead
 of accepting or rejecting a whole hunk.

 Will discard.
 No further feedbacks on the topic for quite some time.

 cf. <d622a95b-7302-43d4-4ec9-b2cf3388c653@talktalk.net>
 I found the feature to be hard to explain, and may result in more
 end-user complaints, but let's see.
