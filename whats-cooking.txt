What's cooking in git.git (Dec 2023, #05; Wed, 27)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and
aren't considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL
to a message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity (of course they can be resubmit when new interests
arise).

The RelNotes symbolic link says we are now working towards Git 2.44.
It may not be a bad idea to reflect on what technical debt and UI
warts we have accumulated so far to see if we have enough of them to
start planning for a breaking Git 3.0 release (or, of course, keep
incrementally improve the system, which is much more preferrable---
continuity and stability is good).  End of year being a relatively
quiet period, it may be a good time to think about your favorite pet
peeve, to be discussed early next year.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/

  (merged to 'next' on 2023-12-14 at 0a3998619e)
 + checkout: forbid "-B <branch>" from touching a branch used elsewhere
 + checkout: refactor die_if_checked_out() caller

 "git checkout -B <branch> [<start-point>]" allowed a branch that is
 in use in another worktree to be updated and checked out, which
 might be a bit unexpected.  The rule has been tightened, which is a
 breaking change.  "--ignore-other-worktrees" option is required to
 unbreak you, if you are used to the current behaviour that "-B"
 overrides the safety.
