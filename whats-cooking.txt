What's cooking in git.git (Jun 2020, #03; Wed, 17)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

* ct/diff-with-merge-base-clarification (2020-06-12) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-06-17 at e0b54a001c)
 + Documentation: usage for diff combined commits
 + git diff: improve range handling
 + t/t3430: avoid undefined git diff behavior

 "git diff" used to take arguments in random and nonsense range
 notation, e.g. "git diff A..B C", "git diff A..B C...D", etc.,
 which has been cleaned up.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* js/default-branch-name (2020-06-10) 9 commits
 - Document how the default branch name can be overridden

 - remote: respect `core.defaultBranchName`
 - init: allow overriding the default branch name for new repositories

 The name of the primary branch in existing repositories, and the
 default name used for the first branch in newly created
 repositories, is made configurable, so that we can eventually wean
 ourselves off of the hardcoded 'master'.

 Expecting a reroll.

 The "fetch/clone" protocol has been updated to allow the server to
 instruct the clients to grab pre-packaged packfile(s) in addition
 to the packed object data coming over the wire.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 commit graph.

 Will merge to 'next'.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* dr/push-remoteref-fix (2020-04-23) 1 commit
 - remote.c: fix handling of %(push:remoteref)

 The "%(push:remoteref)" placeholder in the "--format=" argument of
 "git format-patch" (and friends) only showed what got explicitly
 configured, not what ref at the receiving end would be updated when
 "git push" was used, as it ignored the default behaviour (e.g. update
 the same ref as the source).

 Expecting a reroll.
 cf. <20200416152145.wp2zeibxmuyas6y6@feanor>


* mr/bisect-in-c-2 (2020-04-23) 12 commits

 Expecting a response to reviews.

* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2018-10-15) 1 commit
 - zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* dl/test-must-fail-fixes-5 (2020-06-12) 4 commits

 + worktree: prune duplicate entries referencing same worktree path
 + worktree: make high-level pruning re-usable
 + worktree: give "should be pruned?" function more meaningful name

 The same worktree directory must be registered only once, but
 "git worktree move" allowed this invariant to be violated, which
 has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 There is a rather unpleasant backward compatibility worry with the
 last step of this series, but it is the right thing to do in the
 longer term.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 be built via GitHub actions, in a way similar to how Travis lets
 them mark the commits with an embedded "[skip ci]" string.

 Superseded by dd/ci-only-on-selective-branches topic.

 at GitHub via GitHub Actions, only build when branches with known
 and specific names are updated, and also a pull request.
