What's cooking in git.git (May 2010, #02; Fri, 7)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones
marked with '.' do not appear in any of the integration branches, but I am
still holding onto them.

I'm in the middle of physically moving and haven't started graduating the
topics that have been cooking in 'next'.  Perhaps I can find time to do so
for some of them over the weekend.  I expect that I won't be back up to
speed until later this month.

* js/rebase-origin-x (2010-02-05) 1 commit

 . string_list: Fix argument order for print_string_list
 (this branch uses js/grep-open and sr/remote-helper-export.)

Building this on top of slushy codebase is not a very promising endeavor.
Good thing to do, but it came at a bad time.
