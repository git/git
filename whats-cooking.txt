What's cooking in git.git (Jan 2021, #06; Sat, 30)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'seen' (formerly 'pu'---proposed updates) while commits prefixed
with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

Release tarballs are available at:

 (this branch uses ak/corrected-commit-date; is tangled with ds/merge-base-independent.)


* ds/merge-base-independent (2021-01-28) 3 commits
 - commit-reach: use heuristic in remove_redundant()
 - commit-reach: move compare_commits_by_gen
 - commit-reach: use one walk in remove_redundant()
 (this branch uses ak/corrected-commit-date; is tangled with ds/chunked-file-api.)

 The code to implement "git merge-base --independent" was poorly
 done and was kept from the very beginning of the feature.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/pretty-lazy-load-commit (2021-01-28) 1 commit
 - pretty: lazy-load commit data when expanding user-format

 Some pretty-format specifiers do not need the data in commit object
 (e.g. "%H"), but we were over-eager to load and parse it, which has
 been made even lazier.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/t0000-cleanups (2021-01-28) 4 commits
 - t0000: consistently use single quotes for outer tests
 - t0000: run cleaning test inside sub-test
 - t0000: run prereq tests inside sub-test
 - t0000: keep clean-up tests together

 Code clean-up.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/use-oid-pos (2021-01-28) 6 commits
 - oid_pos(): access table through const pointers
 - hash_pos(): convert to oid_pos()
 - rerere: use strmap to store rerere directories
 - rerere: tighten rr-cache dirname check
 - rerere: check dirname format while iterating rr_cache directory
 - commit_graft_pos(): take an oid instead of a bare hash

 Code clean-up to ensure our use of hashtables using object names as
 keys use the "struct object_id" objects, not the raw hash values.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/weather-balloon-require-variadic-macro (2021-01-27) 1 commit
 - git-compat-util: always enable variadic macros

 We've carried compatibility codepaths for compilers without
 variadic macros for quite some time, but the world may be ready for
 them to be removed.  Force compilation failure on exotic platforms
 where variadic macros are not available to find out who screams in
 such a way that we can easily revert if the world is not ready.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* pb/ci-matrix-wo-shortcut (2021-01-27) 1 commit
 - ci: do not cancel all jobs of a matrix if one fails

 Our setting of GitHub CI test jobs were a bit too eager to give up
 once there is even one failure found.  Tweak the knob to let
 independent jobs to keep running, so that we can find more failures
 in a single run.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sg/test-stress-jobs (2021-01-26) 1 commit
 - test-lib: prevent '--stress-jobs=X' from being ignored

 Test framework fix.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* hv/trailer-formatting (2021-01-30) 5 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - SQUASH: fix sparse error
 - ref-filter: use pretty.c logic for trailers
 - pretty.c: capture invalid trailer argument
 - pretty.c: refactor trailer logic to `format_set_trailers_options()`

 The logic to handle "trailer" related placeholders in the
 "--format=" mechanisms in the "log" family and "for-each-ref"
 family is getting unified.

 Expecting further work.


* jk/p5303-sed-portability-fix (2021-01-29) 1 commit
 - p5303: avoid sed GNU-ism

 A perf script was made more portable.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* pb/blame-funcname-range-userdiff (2021-01-30) 1 commit
 - annotate-tests: quote variable expansions containing path names

 Test fix.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sh/mergetool-hideresolved (2021-01-29) 3 commits
 - mergetool: add per-tool support and overrides for the hideResolved flag
 - mergetool: break setup_tool out into separate initialization function
 - mergetool: add hideResolved configuration

 "git mergetool" feeds three versions (base, local and remote) of
 a conflicted path unmodified.  The command learned to optionally
 prepare these files with unconflicted parts already resolved.

 Getting there.


* tb/precompose-prefix-too (2021-01-29) 1 commit
 - MacOS: precompose_argv_prefix()

 When commands are started from a subdirectory, they may have to
 compare the path to the subdirectory (called prefix and found out
 from $(pwd)) with the tracked paths.  On macOS, $(pwd) and
 readdir() yield decomposed path, while the tracked paths are
 usually normalized to the precomposed form, causing mismatch.  This
 has been fixed by taking the same approach used to normalize the
 command line arguments.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 "git grep" has been tweaked to be limited to the sparse checkout
 paths.

 Break out and fast-track bugfix from the remainder of the topic.

* mt/rm-sparse-checkout (2020-12-08) 1 commit
 - rm: honor sparse checkout patterns
 (this branch uses mt/grep-sparse-checkout.)

 "git rm" follows suit to "git grep" to ignore paths outside the
 sparsity pattern when the sparse checkout feature is in use.

 Need to wait for how these fit in larger picture.

* jk/symlinked-dotgitx-files (2020-10-23) 9 commits
 - docs: document symlink restrictions for .git* files
 - fsck: complain when .gitattributes or .gitignore is a symlink
 - verify_path(): disallow symlinks in .gitattributes and .gitignore
 - t0060: test obscured .gitattributes and .gitignore matching

 - t7450: test verify_path() handling of gitmodules
 - t7415: rename to expand scope
 - fsck_tree(): wrap some long lines
 - fsck_tree(): fix shadowed variable

 "git fsck" and the corresponding check done during the transport
 learned to ensure that in-tree files like `.gitignore` and
 `.gitattributes` are not symbolic links.

 It seems that there are real projects with .gitignore recorded as
 symlinks, which may need to loosen the fsck setting.  Do we need to
 introduce a class that is separate from symlinked .gitmodules that
 has potential consequences that is more/less grave, so that these
 projects can opt out of the new checks?


* sm/curl-retry (2020-10-13) 3 commits
 - http: automatically retry some requests
 - replace CURLOPT_FILE With CURLOPT_WRITEDATA
 - remote-curl: add testing for intelligent retry for HTTP

 The http transport has been taught to retry a failed request that
 may reasonably be retried.

 Expecting a reroll.

 by soliciting objections.

 On hold for now.


* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2018-10-15) 1 commit
 - zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

 - SQUASH??? test fix
 - fetch-pack: print and use dangling .gitmodules
 - fetch-pack: with packfile URIs, use index-pack arg
 - http-fetch: allow custom index-pack args
 - http: allow custom index-pack args

 The approach to "fsck" the incoming objects in "index-pack" is
 attractive for performance reasons (we have them already in core,
 inflated and ready to be inspected), but fundamentally cannot be
 applied fully when we receive more than one pack stream, as a tree
 object in one pack may refer to a blob object in another pack as
 ".gitmodules", when we want to inspect blobs that are used as
 ".gitmodules" file, for example.  Teach "index-pack" to emit
 objects that must be inspected later and check them in the calling
 "fetch-pack" process.

 + builtin/pack-objects.c: avoid iterating all refs

* bc/signed-objects-with-both-hashes (2021-01-18) 6 commits
 - gpg-interface: remove other signature headers before verifying
 - ref-filter: hoist signature parsing
 - commit: allow parsing arbitrary buffers with headers
 - gpg-interface: improve interface for parsing tags

 Looking good.


* js/rebase-i-commit-cleanup-fix (2021-01-28) 1 commit
 - rebase -i: do leave commit message intact in fixup! chains

 When "git rebase -i" processes "fixup" insn, there is no reason to
 clean up the commit log message, but we did the usual stripspace
 processing.  This has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* tb/pack-revindex-on-disk (2021-01-28) 10 commits

 Introduce an on-disk file to record revindex for packdata, which
 traditionally was always created on the fly and only in-core.

 Looking good.

* jt/clone-unborn-head (2021-01-28) 5 commits
 - transport-internal.h: fix a 'hdr-check' warning
 - ls-refs: don't peel NULL oid
 - clone: respect remote unborn HEAD
 - connect, transport: encapsulate arg in struct
 - ls-refs: report unborn targets of symrefs

 "git clone" tries to locally check out the branch pointed at by
 HEAD of the remote repository after it is done, but the protocol
 did not convey the information necessary to do so when copying an
 empty repository.  The protocol v2 learned how to do so.

 Looking good, but the tip one from Ramsay may want to be squashed
 into the step that introduces the problem.

 . fixup! mergetool: break setup_tool out into separate initialization function
 . fixup! fixup! mergetool: add automerge configuration
 . fixup! mergetool: add automerge configuration
 . mergetool: add automerge_enabled tool-specific override function
 . mergetool: break setup_tool out into separate initialization function

 a conflicted path unmodified.  The command learned to optionally
 prepare these files with unconflicted parts already resolved.

 Superseded by the sh/mergetool-hideresolved topic.
