What's cooking in git.git (Aug 2012, #05; Sat, 18)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.

I'll be tagging the v1.7.12 final sometime tomorrow, and following
the tradition the next branch will be rebuilt on top of 'master'
after a few days.  We would also eject some topics in 'next' that
turned out to be mistakes when that rebuilding happens, but I do not
think we have any such topics right now.  And then, post 1.7.12
cycle opens.  I think the next cycle should start the transition of
that much waited "push default change" topic and perhaps we may want
to even call it 1.8.0 release.  I haven't decided yet.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches of the
repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* hv/coding-guidelines (2012-08-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-08-18 at 5a78f2c)
 + Documentation/CodingGuidelines: spell out more shell guidelines

In earlier days, "imitate the style in the neibouring code" was
sufficient to keep the coherent style, but over time some parts of
the codebase have drifted enough to make it ineffective.

* jc/daemon-access-hook (2012-08-15) 1 commit
 - daemon: --access-hook option

Allow an external command to tell git-daemon to decline service
based on the client address, repository path, etc.

* jc/send-email-reconfirm (2012-08-14) 1 commit
 - send-email: validate & reconfirm interactive responses

Validate interactive input to "git send-email" to avoid common
mistakes such as saying "y<RETURN>" to sender mail address whose
prompt is given with a correctly guessed default.

* jc/maint-abbrev-option-cli (2012-08-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-08-18 at e002006)
 + gitcli: describe abbreviation of long options

We did not document that many commands take unique prefix
abbreviations of long options (e.g. "--option" may be the only flag
that the command accepts that begin with "--opt", in which case you
can give "--opt") anywhere easy to find for new people.

* mv/pull-r-for-rebase (2012-08-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-08-18 at e7d885b)

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* mz/rebase-range (2012-07-18) 7 commits
 . rebase (without -p): correctly calculate patches to rebase
 . rebase -p: don't request --left-right only to ignore left side
 . rebase -p: use --cherry-mark for todo file
 . git-rebase--interactive.sh: look up subject in add_pick_line
 . git-rebase--interactive: group all $preserve_merges code
 . git-rebase--interactive.sh: extract function for adding "pick" line
 . git-rebase--am.sh: avoid special-casing --keep-empty

Expecting a reroll.

Performance concerns from Windows folks.  Also the series lacks
proper sign-offs.

* jl/submodule-rm (2012-07-05) 2 commits
 - rm: remove submodules from the index and the .gitmodules file
 - rm: don't fail when removing populated submodules

Expecting a reroll.

* lt/commit-tree-guess-utf-8 (2012-06-28) 1 commit
 - commit/commit-tree: correct latin1 to utf-8

Teaches "git commit" and "git commit-tree" the "we are told to use
utf-8 in log message, but this does not look like utf-8---attempt to
pass it through convert-from-latin1-to-utf8 and see if it makes
sense" heuristics "git mailinfo" already uses.

A draft from Linus received privately without a log message.
Expecting a reroll.

* mb/remote-default-nn-origin (2012-07-11) 6 commits
 - Teach get_default_remote to respect remote.default.
 - Test that plain "git fetch" uses remote.default when on a detached HEAD.
 - Teach clone to set remote.default.
 - Teach "git remote" about remote.default.
 - Teach remote.c about the remote.default configuration setting.
 - Rename remote.c's default_remote_name static variables.

When the user does not specify what remote to interact with, we
often attempt to use 'origin'.  This can now be customized via a
configuration variable.

Expecting a reroll.
"The first remote becomes the default" bit is better done as a
separate step.

* jc/split-blob (2012-04-03) 6 commits
 - chunked-object: streaming checkout
 - chunked-object: fallback checkout codepaths
 - bulk-checkin: support chunked-object encoding
 - bulk-checkin: allow the same data to be multiply hashed
 - new representation types in the packstream
 - packfile: use varint functions

Not ready.

I finished the streaming checkout codepath, but as explained in
127b177 (bulk-checkin: support chunked-object encoding, 2011-11-30),
these are still early steps of a long and painful journey. At least
pack-objects and fsck need to learn the new encoding for the series
to be usable locally, and then index-pack/unpack-objects needs to
learn it to be used remotely.

Given that I heard a lot of noise that people want large files, and
that I was asked by somebody at GitTogether'11 privately for an
advice on how to pay developers (not me) to help adding necessary
support, I am somewhat dissapointed that the original patch series
that was sent long time ago still remains here without much comments
and updates from the developer community. I even made the interface
to the logic that decides where to split chunks easily replaceable,
and I deliberately made the logic in the original patch extremely
stupid to entice others, especially the "bup" fanbois, to come up
with a better logic, thinking that giving people an easy target to
shoot for, they may be encouraged to help out. The plan is not
working :-<.

[Cooking]

* ph/stash-rerere (2012-08-17) 2 commits
 - stash: invoke rerere in case of conflict
 - test: git-stash conflict sets up rerere

* hv/submodule-path-unmatch (2012-08-14) 1 commit
 - Let submodule command exit with error status if path does not exist

As the title says.

* jc/add-delete-default (2012-08-13) 1 commit
 - git add: notice removal of tracked paths by default

"git add dir/" updated modified files and added new files, but does
not notice removed files, which may be "Huh?" to some users.  They
can of course use "git add -A dir/", but why should they?

* jc/maint-rev-list-topo-doc (2012-08-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-08-18 at d1f54d9)
 + rev-list docs: clarify --topo-order description

It was unclear what "--topo-order" was really about in the
documentation. It is not just about "children before parent", but
also about "don't mix lineages".

* bc/receive-pack-stdout-protection (2012-08-06) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-08-07 at d7aa316)
 + receive-pack: do not leak output from auto-gc to standard output
 + t/t5400: demonstrate breakage caused by informational message from prune

When "git push" triggered the automatic gc on the receiving end, a
message from "git prune" that said it was removing cruft leaked to
the standard output, breaking the communication protocol.

Not urgent (non regression).

* bc/prune-info (2012-08-07) 1 commit
 - prune.c: only print informational message in show_only or verbose mode

Teach "git prune" without "-v" to be silent about leftover temporary files.

Not urgent (non regression).

* jc/tag-doc (2012-08-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-08-18 at 9fe64b2)
 + Documentation: do not mention .git/refs/* directories

Our documentation used to assume having files in .git/refs/*
directories was the only to have branches and tags, but that is not
true for quite some time.

Not urgent (non regression).

* jk/docs-docbook-monospace-display (2012-08-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-08-18 at 7e02bf8)
 + docs: monospace listings in docbook output

The documentation in the TeXinfo format was using indented output
for materials meant to be examples that are better typeset in
monospace.

Not urgent (non regression).

* jc/maint-protect-sh-from-ifs (2012-08-08) 1 commit
 - sh-setup: protect from exported IFS

When the user exports a non-default IFS without HT, scripts that
rely on being able to parse "ls-files -s | while read a b c..."
start to fail.  Protect them from such a misconfiguration.

* jk/check-docs-update (2012-08-08) 8 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-08-18 at 4409d2e)

 + check-docs: factor out command-list
 + command-list: mention git-credential-* helpers
 + command-list: add git-sh-i18n
 + check-docs: update non-command documentation list
 + check-docs: mention gitweb specially

Simplify "make check-docs" implementation and update its coverage.

* js/gitweb-path-info-unquote (2012-08-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-08-15 at 844da17)
 + gitweb: URL-decode $my_url/$my_uri when stripping PATH_INFO

Stripping of PATH_INFO in gitweb did not take url style quoting into
account, failing to notice directories with funny characters e.g. SP
in their paths.

Not urgent (non regression).

* mg/rebase-i-onto-reflog-in-full (2012-08-10) 1 commit
 - rebase -i: use full onto sha1 in reflog

The reflog entries left by "git rebase" and "git rebase -i" were
inconsistent.

 - fetch-pack: mention server version with verbose output
 - parse_feature_request: make it easier to see feature values
 - fetch-pack: do not ask for unadvertised capabilities
 (this branch uses jk/version-string.)

Some capabilities were asked by fetch-pack even when upload-pack did
not advertise that they are available.  Fix fetch-pack not to do so.

Allows pushing and fetching refs/stash.

* jk/version-string (2012-08-10) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-08-10 at d8dcb00)
 + do not send client agent unless server does first
 + send-pack: fix capability-sending logic
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-08-09 at 64dc91b)
 + include agent identifier in capability string
 (this branch is used by jc/capabilities.)

Leftover bits from the "git version" code restructuring, that give
us an ability to expose the Git version over the wire in the
protocol exchange. But we do so carefully only to the other end that
understands it.

Not urgent (non regression).

* js/grep-patterntype-config (2012-08-03) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-08-09 at 1a08d6c)

"grep" learned to use a non-standard pattern type by default if a
configuration variable tells it to.

Not urgent (non regression).

Remove unnecessary code.
Not urgent (non regression).

* mk/test-seq (2012-08-04) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-08-06 at 3f6917c)
 + tests: Introduce test_seq
 (this branch is used by ab/diff-write-incomplete-line.)

Add a compatibility/utility function to the test framework. 

Not urgent (non regression).

* ab/diff-write-incomplete-line (2012-08-05) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-08-07 at dcf02ae)
 + Fix '\ No newline...' annotation in rewrite diffs
 (this branch uses mk/test-seq.)

The output from "git diff -B" for a file that ends with an
incomplete line did not put "\ No newline..." on a line of its own.

Not urgent (non regression).

  (merged to 'next' on 2012-08-05 at aa9f5e9)

  (merged to 'next' on 2012-08-06 at a9f2101)
 + read_index_from: remove bogus errno assignments

Assignments to errno before calling system functions that used to
matter in the old code were left behind after the code structure
changed sufficiently to make them useless.

Not urgent (non regression).

* jc/maint-sane-execvp-notdir (2012-07-31) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-08-09 at 5dd4240)
 + sane_execvp(): ignore non-directory on $PATH

"git foo" errored out with "Not a directory" when the user had a non
directory on $PATH, and worse yet it masked an alias "foo" to run.

Not urgent (non regression).

* jc/sanitize-nkd-lazy-iconv-open (2012-07-31) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-08-09 at 832c238)

Teach the code that works around NKD/NKC gotcha on MacOS to call
iconv_open() only when it is necessary, in the hope of avoiding
set-up overhead.

Not urgent (non regression).

* tr/maint-send-email-2047 (2012-07-31) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-08-09 at 17dfe57)
 + send-email: improve RFC2047 quote parsing

"git send-email" did not unquote encoded words that appear on the
header correctly, and lost "_" from strings.

Not urgent (non regression).

* cw/cherry-pick-allow-empty-message (2012-08-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-08-09 at eab95f6)
 + cherry-pick: add --allow-empty-message option

"git cherry-pick" by default stops when it sees a commit without any
log message.  The "--allow-empty-message" option can be used to
silently proceed.

Not urgent (non regression).

* jc/maint-t7406-rev-parse-max-count-huh (2012-07-30) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-07-30 at 9b27acc)

Test clean-up, with no behaviour change.
Not urgent (non regression).

* jk/maint-diff-nul40-as-sentinel (2012-07-29) 1 commit
 + diff: do not use null sha1 as a sentinel value
 (this branch is used by jk/maint-null-in-trees.)

"git diff" had a confusion between taking data from a path in the
working tree and taking data from an object that happens to have
name 0{40} recorded in a tree.

 - cherry: remove redundant check for merge commit

 + config: "git config baa" should exit with status 1

The exit status code from "git config" was way overspecified while
being incorrect.  Update the implementation to give the documented
status for a case that was documented, and introduce a new code for
"all other errors".
