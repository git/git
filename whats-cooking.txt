What's cooking in git.git (Mar 2021, #02; Mon, 8)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'seen' (formerly 'pu'---proposed updates) while commits prefixed
with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

The second release candidate Git v2.31.0-rc2 will be tagged tomorrow.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

Release tarballs are available at:

 + config.mak.uname: enable OPEN_RETURNS_EINTR for macOS Big Sur

 Work around platforms whose open() is reported to return EINTR (it
 shouldn't, as we do our signals with SA_RESTART).

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

 + fetch-pack: do not mix --pack_header and packfile uri

 The code to fsck objects received across multiple packs during a
 single git fetch session has been broken when the packfile URI
 feature was in use.  A workaround has been added by disabling the
 codepath to avoid keeping a packfile that is too small.

 Will merge to 'master'.

* jk/symlinked-dotgitx-files (2020-10-23) 9 commits
 - docs: document symlink restrictions for .git* files
 - fsck: complain when .gitattributes or .gitignore is a symlink
 - verify_path(): disallow symlinks in .gitattributes and .gitignore
 - t0060: test obscured .gitattributes and .gitignore matching

 - t7450: test verify_path() handling of gitmodules
 - t7415: rename to expand scope
 - fsck_tree(): wrap some long lines
 - fsck_tree(): fix shadowed variable

 "git fsck" and the corresponding check done during the transport
 learned to ensure that in-tree files like `.gitignore` and
 `.gitattributes` are not symbolic links.

 It seems that there are real projects with .gitignore recorded as
 symlinks, which may need to loosen the fsck setting.  Do we need to
 introduce a class that is separate from symlinked .gitmodules that
 has potential consequences that is more/less grave, so that these
 projects can opt out of the new checks?

[Cooking]

* ab/remote-write-config-in-camel-case (2021-02-24) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-03-01 at a01bd0d8e4)
 + remote: write camel-cased *.pushRemote on rename

  (merged to 'next' on 2021-03-01 at 357954af7c)
 + convert: fail gracefully upon missing clean cmd on required filter

 We had a code to diagnose and die cleanly when a required
 clean/smudge filter is missing, but an assert before that
 unnecessarily fired, hiding the end-user facing die() message.

* cm/rebase-i-fixup-amend-reword (2021-03-01) 6 commits
 - doc/git-commit: add documentation for fixup=[amend|reword] options
 - t3437: use --fixup with options to create amend! commit
 - t7500: add tests for --fixup=[amend|reword] options
 - commit: add a reword suboption to --fixup

 - sequencer: export subject_length()
 (this branch uses cm/rebase-i and cm/rebase-i-updates.)

 "git commit --fixup=<commit>", which was to tweak the changes made
 to the contents while keeping the original log message intact,
 learned "--fixup=(amend|reword):<commit>", that can be used to
 tweak both the message and the contents, and only the message,
 respectively.

  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-25 at a784bf7be6)
 + mailmap: do not respect symlinks for in-tree .mailmap
 + exclude: do not respect symlinks for in-tree .gitignore
 + attr: do not respect symlinks for in-tree .gitattributes
 + exclude: add flags parameter to add_patterns()
 + attr: convert "macro_ok" into a flags field

 It does not make sense to make ".gitattributes", ".gitignore" and
 ".mailmap" symlinks, as they are supposed to be usable from the
 object store (think: bare repositories where HEAD:.mailmap etc. are
 used).  When these files are symbolic links, we used to read the
 contents of the files pointed by them by mistake, which has been
 corrected.

 + builtin/repack.c: do not repack single packs with --geometric
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-25 at a854fdbaff)
 + builtin/repack.c: add '--geometric' option
 + packfile: add kept-pack cache for find_kept_pack_entry()
 + builtin/pack-objects.c: rewrite honor-pack-keep logic
 + p5303: measure time to repack with keep
 + p5303: add missing &&-chains
 + builtin/pack-objects.c: add '--stdin-packs' option
 + revision: learn '--no-kept-objects'
 + packfile: introduce 'find_kept_pack_entry()'

 "git repack" so far has been only capable of repacking everything
 under the sun into a single pack (or split by size).  A cleverer
 strategy to reduce the cost of repacking a repository has been
 introduced.

 Will cook in 'next'.

 Doc update.

 cw/pack-config-doc supersedes this with a bit more coverage on
 related knobs.
