What's cooking in git.git (Sep 2016, #05; Mon, 19)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

[Graduated to "master"]

* ah/misc-message-fixes (2016-09-08) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-09-12 at a113aea)
 + unpack-trees: do not capitalize "working"
 + git-merge-octopus: do not capitalize "octopus"
 + git-rebase--interactive: fix English grammar
 + cat-file: put spaces around pipes in usage string
 + am: put spaces around pipe in usage string

 Message cleanup.


* bc/object-id (2016-09-07) 20 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-09-15 at 34c6459)
 + builtin/reset: convert to use struct object_id
 + builtin/commit-tree: convert to struct object_id
 + builtin/am: convert to struct object_id
 + refs: add an update_ref_oid function.
 + sha1_name: convert get_sha1_mb to struct object_id
 + builtin/update-index: convert file to struct object_id
 + notes: convert init_notes to use struct object_id
 + builtin/rm: convert to use struct object_id
 + builtin/blame: convert file to use struct object_id
 + Convert read_mmblob to take struct object_id.
 + notes-merge: convert struct notes_merge_pair to struct object_id
 + builtin/checkout: convert some static functions to struct object_id
 + streaming: make stream_blob_to_fd take struct object_id
 + builtin: convert textconv_object to use struct object_id
 + builtin/cat-file: convert some static functions to struct object_id
 + builtin/cat-file: convert struct expand_data to use struct object_id
 + builtin/log: convert some static functions to use struct object_id
 + builtin/blame: convert struct origin to use struct object_id
 + builtin/apply: convert static functions to struct object_id
 + cache: convert struct cache_entry to use struct object_id

 The "unsigned char sha1[20]" to "struct object_id" conversion
 continues.  Notable changes in this round includes that ce->sha1,
 i.e. the object name recorded in the cache_entry, turns into an
 object_id.

 It had merge conflicts with a few topics in flight (Christian's
 "apply.c split", Dscho's "cat-file --filters" and Jeff Hostetler's
 "status --porcelain-v2").  Extra sets of eyes double-checking for
 mismerges are highly appreciated.


* cc/apply-am (2016-09-07) 41 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-09-12 at 854edde)

 + apply: move 'struct apply_state' to apply.h
 + apply: make some names more specific

 "git am" has been taught to make an internal call to "git apply"'s
 innards without spawning the latter as a separate process.


* jk/fix-remote-curl-url-wo-proto (2016-09-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-09-12 at 7845867)
 + remote-curl: handle URLs without protocol

 "git fetch http::/site/path" did not die correctly and segfaulted
 instead.


* jk/pack-tag-of-tag (2016-09-07) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-09-12 at 62c62c0)
 + pack-objects: walk tag chains for --include-tag
 + t5305: simplify packname handling
 + t5305: use "git -C"
 + t5305: drop "dry-run" of unpack-objects
 + t5305: move cleanup into test block

 "git pack-objects --include-tag" was taught that when we know that
 we are sending an object C, we want a tag B that directly points at
 C but also a tag A that points at the tag B.  We used to miss the
 intermediate tag B in some cases.


* js/git-gui-commit-gpgsign (2016-09-11) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-09-12 at 05350ab)
 + Merge branch 'js/commit-gpgsign' of ../git-gui into js/git-gui-commit-gpgsign
 + git-gui: respect commit.gpgsign again

 "git commit-tree" stopped reading commit.gpgsign configuration
 variable that was meant for Porcelain "git commit" in Git 2.9; we
 forgot to update "git gui" to look at the configuration to match
 this change.


* js/sequencer-wo-die (2016-09-09) 17 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-09-12 at d2154ea)
 + sequencer: ensure to release the lock when we could not read the index
 + sequencer: lib'ify checkout_fast_forward()
 + sequencer: lib'ify fast_forward_to()
 + sequencer: lib'ify save_opts()
 + sequencer: lib'ify save_todo()
 + sequencer: lib'ify save_head()
 + sequencer: lib'ify create_seq_dir()
 + sequencer: lib'ify read_populate_opts()
 + sequencer: lib'ify read_populate_todo()
 + sequencer: lib'ify read_and_refresh_cache()
 + sequencer: lib'ify prepare_revs()
 + sequencer: lib'ify walk_revs_populate_todo()
 + sequencer: lib'ify do_pick_commit()
 + sequencer: lib'ify do_recursive_merge()
 + sequencer: lib'ify write_message()
 + sequencer: do not die() in do_pick_commit()
 + sequencer: lib'ify sequencer_pick_revisions()

 Lifts calls to exit(2) and die() higher in the callchain in
 sequencer.c files so that more helper functions in it can be used
 by callers that want to handle error conditions themselves.


* mh/ref-store (2016-09-09) 38 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-09-12 at 1b0bd3c)

 The ref-store abstraction was introduced to the refs API so that we
 can plug in different backends to store references.


* sb/diff-cleanup (2016-09-08) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-09-12 at 5d16b28)
 + diff: remove dead code
 + diff: omit found pointer from emit_callback
 + diff.c: use diff_options directly

 Code cleanup.


* sy/git-gui-i18n-ja (2016-09-07) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-09-12 at 4a701c2)
 + Merge branch 'sy/i18n' of git-gui
 + git-gui: update Japanese information
 + git-gui: update Japanese translation
 + git-gui: add Japanese language code
 + git-gui: apply po template to Japanese translation
 + git-gui: consistently use the same word for "blame" in Japanese
 + git-gui: consistently use the same word for "remote" in Japanese

 Update Japanese translation for "git-gui".

* rs/xdiff-merge-overlapping-hunks-for-W-context (2016-09-14) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-09-15 at eaa85ab)
 + xdiff: fix merging of hunks with -W context and -u context

 "git diff -W" output needs to extend the context backward to
 include the header line of the current function and also forward to
 include the body of the entire current function up to the header
 line of the next one.  This process may have to merge to adjacent
 hunks, but the code forgot to do so in some cases.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* mm/config-color-ui-default-to-auto (2016-09-16) 1 commit
 - Documentation/config: default for color.* is color.ui

 Documentation for individual configuration variables to control use
 of color (like `color.grep`) said that their default value was
 'false', instead of saying their default is taken from `color.ui`.
 When we updated the default value for color.ui from 'false' to
 'auto' quite a while ago, all of them broke.  This has been
 corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* rs/c-auto-resets-attributes (2016-09-19) 1 commit
 - pretty: let %C(auto) reset all attributes

 The pretty-format specifier used by the "log" family of commands
 have "%C(auto)" to turn coloring of the output is taught to also
 issue a color-reset sequence to the output.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* rs/cocci (2016-09-15) 3 commits
 - use strbuf_addstr() for adding constant strings to a strbuf, part 2
 - add coccicheck make target
 - contrib/coccinelle: fix semantic patch for oid_to_hex_r()

 Code cleanup.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* va/i18n-more (2016-09-19) 6 commits
 - i18n: stash: mark messages for translation
 - i18n: notes-merge: mark die messages for translation
 - i18n: ident: mark hint for translation
 - i18n: diff: mark die errors for translation
 - i18n: connect: mark die messages for translation
 - i18n: commit: mark message for translation
 (this branch uses va/i18n.)

 Even more i18n.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jt/mailinfo-fold-in-body-headers (2016-09-19) 2 commits
 - mailinfo: make is_scissors_line take plain char *
 - mailinfo: separate in-body header processing


* kd/mailinfo-quoted-string (2016-09-19) 2 commits
 - mailinfo: unescape quoted-pair in header fields
 - t5100-mailinfo: replace common path prefix with variable

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* jc/bundle (2016-03-03) 6 commits
 - index-pack: --clone-bundle option
 - Merge branch 'jc/index-pack' into jc/bundle
 - bundle v3: the beginning
 - bundle: keep a copy of bundle file name in the in-core bundle header
 - bundle: plug resource leak
 - bundle doc: 'verify' is not about verifying the bundle

 The beginning of "split bundle", which could be one of the
 ingredients to allow "git clone" traffic off of the core server
 network to CDN.

 While I think it would make it easier for people to experiment and
 build on if the topic is merged to 'next', I am at the same time a
 bit reluctant to merge an unproven new topic that introduces a new
 file format, which we may end up having to support til the end of
 time.  It is likely that to support a "prime clone from CDN", it
 would need a lot more than just "these are the heads and the pack
 data is over there", so this may not be sufficient.

 Will discard.


* jc/blame-reverse (2016-06-14) 2 commits
 - blame: dwim "blame --reverse OLD" as "blame --reverse OLD.."
 - blame: improve diagnosis for "--reverse NEW"

 It is a common mistake to say "git blame --reverse OLD path",
 expecting that the command line is dwimmed as if asking how lines
 in path in an old revision OLD have survived up to the current
 commit.

 Has been waiting for positive responses without seeing any.

 Will discard.


* jc/attr (2016-05-25) 18 commits
 - attr: support quoting pathname patterns in C style
 - attr: expose validity check for attribute names
 - attr: add counted string version of git_attr()
 - attr: add counted string version of git_check_attr()
 - attr: retire git_check_attrs() API
 - attr: convert git_check_attrs() callers to use the new API
 - attr: convert git_all_attrs() to use "struct git_attr_check"
 - attr: (re)introduce git_check_attr() and struct git_attr_check
 - attr: rename function and struct related to checking attributes
 - attr.c: plug small leak in parse_attr_line()
 - attr.c: tighten constness around "git_attr" structure
 - attr.c: simplify macroexpand_one()
 - attr.c: mark where #if DEBUG ends more clearly
 - attr.c: complete a sentence in a comment
 - attr.c: explain the lack of attr-name syntax check in parse_attr()
 - attr.c: update a stale comment on "struct match_attr"
 - attr.c: use strchrnul() to scan for one line
 - commit.c: use strchrnul() to scan for one line
 (this branch is used by jc/attr-more, sb/pathspec-label and sb/submodule-default-paths.)

 The attributes API has been updated so that it can later be
 optimized using the knowledge of which attributes are queried.

 I wanted to polish this topic further to make the attribute
 subsystem thread-ready, but because other topics depend on this
 topic and they do not (yet) need it to be thread-ready.

 As the authors of topics that depend on this seem not in a hurry,
 let's discard this and dependent topics and restart them some other
 day.

 Will discard.


* jc/attr-more (2016-06-09) 8 commits
 - attr.c: outline the future plans by heavily commenting
 - attr.c: always pass check[] to collect_some_attrs()
 - attr.c: introduce empty_attr_check_elems()
 - attr.c: correct ugly hack for git_all_attrs()
 - attr.c: rename a local variable check
 - fixup! d5ad6c13
 - attr.c: pass struct git_attr_check down the callchain
 - attr.c: add push_stack() helper
 (this branch uses jc/attr; is tangled with sb/pathspec-label and sb/submodule-default-paths.)

 The beginning of long and tortuous journey to clean-up attribute
 subsystem implementation.

 Needs to be redone.
 Will discard.


* sb/submodule-default-paths (2016-06-20) 5 commits
 - completion: clone can recurse into submodules
 - clone: add --init-submodule=<pathspec> switch
 - submodule update: add `--init-default-path` switch
 - Merge branch 'sb/pathspec-label' into sb/submodule-default-paths
 - Merge branch 'jc/attr' into sb/submodule-default-paths
 (this branch uses jc/attr and sb/pathspec-label; is tangled with jc/attr-more.)

 Allow specifying the set of submodules the user is interested in on
 the command line of "git clone" that clones the superproject.

 Will discard.


* sb/pathspec-label (2016-06-03) 6 commits
 - pathspec: disable preload-index when attribute pathspec magic is in use
 - pathspec: allow escaped query values
 - pathspec: allow querying for attributes
 - pathspec: move prefix check out of the inner loop
 - pathspec: move long magic parsing out of prefix_pathspec
 - Documentation: fix a typo
 (this branch is used by sb/submodule-default-paths; uses jc/attr; is tangled with jc/attr-more.)

 The pathspec mechanism learned ":(attr:X)$pattern" pathspec magic
 to limit paths that match $pattern further by attribute settings.
 The preload-index mechanism is disabled when the new pathspec magic
 is in use (at least for now), because the attribute subsystem is
 not thread-ready.

 Will discard.


* mh/connect (2016-06-06) 10 commits
 - connect: [host:port] is legacy for ssh
 - connect: move ssh command line preparation to a separate function
 - connect: actively reject git:// urls with a user part
 - connect: change the --diag-url output to separate user and host
 - connect: make parse_connect_url() return the user part of the url as a separate value
 - connect: group CONNECT_DIAG_URL handling code
 - connect: make parse_connect_url() return separated host and port
 - connect: re-derive a host:port string from the separate host and port variables
 - connect: call get_host_and_port() earlier
 - connect: document why we sometimes call get_port after get_host_and_port

 Rewrite Git-URL parsing routine (hopefully) without changing any
 behaviour.

 It has been two months without any support.  We may want to discard
 this.


* sb/bisect (2016-04-15) 22 commits
 . SQUASH???
 . bisect: get back halfway shortcut
 . bisect: compute best bisection in compute_relevant_weights()
 . bisect: use a bottom-up traversal to find relevant weights
 . bisect: prepare for different algorithms based on find_all
 . bisect: rename count_distance() to compute_weight()
 . bisect: make total number of commits global
 . bisect: introduce distance_direction()

 . bisect: write about `bisect next` in documentation

 The internal algorithm used in "git bisect" to find the next commit
 to check has been optimized greatly.

 Was expecting a reroll, but now pb/bisect topic starts removinging
 more and more parts from git-bisect.sh, this needs to see a fresh
 reroll.

 Will discard.

 Follow-on to dk/gc-idx-wo-pack topic, to clean up stale
 .bitmap and .keep files.

 Has been waiting for a reroll for too long.

* jc/diff-b-m (2015-02-23) 5 commits
 . WIPWIP
 . WIP: diff-b-m
 - diffcore-rename: allow easier debugging
 - diffcore-rename.c: add locate_rename_src()
 - diffcore-break: allow debugging

 "git diff -B -M" produced incorrect patch when the postimage of a
 completely rewritten file is similar to the preimage of a removed
 file; such a resulting file must not be expressed as a rename from
 other place.

 The fix in this patch is broken, unfortunately.

 Will discard.

* et/add-chmod-x (2016-09-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-09-15 at c81abae)
 + add: document the chmod option
 (this branch is used by tg/add-chmod+x-fix.)

 "git add --chmod=+x" added recently lacked documentation, which has
 been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* js/libify-require-clean-work-tree (2016-09-12) 5 commits
 - wt-status: teach has_{unstaged,uncommitted}_changes() about submodules
 - Export also the has_un{staged,committed}_changed() functions
 - Make the require_clean_work_tree() function truly reusable
 - pull: make code more similar to the shell script again
 - pull: drop confusing prefix parameter of die_on_unclean_work_tree()

 The require_clean_work_tree() helper was recreated in C when "git
 pull" was rewritten from shell; the helper is now made available to
 other callers in preparation for upcoming "rebase -i" work.

 Waiting for comments.
 Modulo a few minor nits, this looked almost ready.

  (merged to 'next' on 2016-09-15 at 261878d)
 + t/perf/run: copy config.mak.autogen & friends to build area

 Performance tests done via "t/perf" did not use the same set of
 build configuration if the user relied on autoconf generated
 configuration.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* tg/add-chmod+x-fix (2016-09-15) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-09-15 at a97bdfd)
 + add: modify already added files when --chmod is given
 + read-cache: introduce chmod_index_entry
 + update-index: add test for chmod flags
 + Merge branch 'ib/t3700-add-chmod-x-updates' into tg/add-chmod+x-fix
 (this branch uses et/add-chmod-x.)

 "git add --chmod=+x <pathspec>" added recently only toggled the
 executable bit for paths that are either new or modified. This has
 been corrected to flip the executable bit for all paths that match
 the given pathspec.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* bw/ls-files-recurse-submodules (2016-09-13) 3 commits
 - SQUASH???  Undecided
 - SQUASH???
 - ls-files: adding support for submodules

 "git ls-files" learned "--recurse-submodules" option that can be
 used to get a listing of tracked files across submodules (i.e. this
 only works with "--cached" option, not for listing untracked or
 ignored files).  This would be a useful tool to sit on the upstream
 side of a pipe that is read with xargs to work on all working tree
 files from the top-level superproject.

 Waiting for the discussion to conclude.


* bw/pathspec-remove-unused-extern-decl (2016-09-13) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-09-15 at c5b281b)
 + pathspec: remove unnecessary function prototypes

 + http: always remove curl easy from curlm session on release
 + http: consolidate #ifdefs for curl_multi_remove_handle
 + http: warn on curl_multi_add_handle failures

 The http transport (with curl-multi option, which is the default
 these days) failed to remove curl-easy handle from a curlm session,
 which led to unnecessary API failures.

  (merged to 'next' on 2016-09-15 at 1e35f8d)
 + add_delta_base_cache: use list_for_each_safe

 Recently we updated the code to manage the in-core cache that holds
 objects that have recently been used to reconstitute other objects
 that are stored as deltas against them, but the update used an
 incorrect API function to manage the list of these objects.  This
 has been fixed.

 This is a last-minute fix to a topic that graduated to 'master'
 post 2.10 release.

 There were numerous corner cases in which the configuration files
 are read and used or not read at all depending on the directory a
 Git command was run, leading to inconsistent behaviour.  The code
 to set-up repository access at the beginning of a Git process has
 been updated to fix them.

* ls/filter-process (2016-09-13) 10 commits
 - convert: add filter.<driver>.process option

 - convert: quote filter names in error messages
 - pkt-line: add functions to read/write flush terminated packet streams

 - pkt-line: add packet_flush_gently()
 - pkt-line: add packet_write_fmt_gently()
 - pkt-line: extract set_packet_header()
 - pkt-line: rename packet_write() to packet_write_fmt()

 The smudge/clean filter API expect an external process is spawned
 to filter the contents for each path that has a filter defined.  A
 new type of "process" filter API has been added to allow the first
 request to run the filter for a path to spawn a single process, and
 all filtering need is served by this single process for multiple
 paths, reducing the process creation overhead.

 Waiting for the discussion to conclude.

* hv/submodule-not-yet-pushed-fix (2016-09-15) 5 commits
 . SQUASH??? -Wdecl-after-stmt
 . use actual start hashes for submodule push check instead of local refs
 . batch check whether submodule needs pushing into one call
 - serialize collection of refs that contain submodule changes
 - serialize collection of changed submodules

 The code in "git push" to compute if any commit being pushed in the
 superproject binds a commit in a submodule that hasn't been pushed
 out was overly inefficient, making it unusable even for a small
 project that does not have any submodule but have a reasonable
 number of refs.  This has been optimized.

 The last two in the original series seem to break a few tests when
 queued to 'pu'.

 + connect: advertized capability is not a ref
 + connect: tighten check for unexpected early hang up
 + tests: move test_lazy_prereq JGIT to test-lib.sh

 JGit can show a fake ref "capabilities^{}" to "git fetch" when it
 does not advertise any refs, but "git fetch" was not prepared to
 see such an advertisement.  When the other side disconnects without
 giving any ref advertisement, we used to say "there may not be a
 repository at that URL", but we may have seen other advertisement
 like "shallow" and ".have" in which case we definitely know that a
 repository is there.  The code to detect this case has also been
 updated.

 - checkout.txt: document a common case that ignores ambiguation rules
 - checkout: add some spaces between code and comment

 "git checkout <word>" does not follow the usual disambiguation
 rules when the <word> can be both a rev and a path, to allow
 checking out a branch 'foo' in a project that happens to have a
 file 'foo' in the working tree without having to disambiguate.
 This was poorly documented and the check was incorrect when the

 The prereleaseSuffix feature of version comparison that is used in
 "git tag -l" did not correctly when two or more prereleases for the
 same release were present (e.g. when 2.0, 2.0-beta1, and 2.0-beta2
 are there and the code needs to compare 2.0-beta1 and 2.0-beta2).

 + cat-file: introduce the --filters option
 + cat-file: fix a grammo in the man page

 Even though "git hash-objects", which is a tool to take an
 on-filesystem data stream and put it into the Git object store,
 allowed to perform the "outside-world-to-Git" conversions (e.g.
 end-of-line conversions and application of the clean-filter), and
 it had the feature on by default from very early days, its reverse
 operation "git cat-file", which takes an object from the Git object
 store and externalize for the consumption by the outside world,
 lacked an equivalent mechanism to run the "Git-to-outside-world"
 conversion.  The command learned the "--filters" option to do so.

 "git gc --aggressive" used to limit the delta-chain length to 250,

 Output from "git diff" can be made easier to read by selecting

 intelligently when the lines before and after the changed section
 are the same.  A command line option is added to help with the
 experiment to find a good heuristics.

 Even when "git pull --rebase=preserve" (and the underlying "git
 rebase --preserve") can complete without creating any new commit
 (i.e. fast-forwards), it still insisted on having a usable ident
 information (read: user.email is set correctly), which was less
 than nice.  As the underlying commands used inside "git rebase"
 would fail with a more meaningful error message and advice text
 when the bogus ident matters, this extra check was removed.

  (merged to 'next' on 2016-07-13 at d9ca7fb)
 + pathspec: warn on empty strings as pathspec

 An empty string used as a pathspec element has always meant
 'everything matches', but it is too easy to write a script that
 finds a path to remove in $path and run 'git rm "$paht"', which
 ends up removing everything.  Start warning about this use of an
 empty string used for 'everything matches' and ask users to use a
 more explicit '.' for that instead.

 The hope is that existing users will not mind this change, and
 eventually the warning can be turned into a hard error, upgrading
 the deprecation into removal of this (mis)feature.

 The existing "git fetch --depth=<n>" option was hard to use
 correctly when making the history of an existing shallow clone
 deeper.  A new option, "--deepen=<n>", has been added to make this
 easier to use.  "git clone" also learned "--shallow-since=<date>"
 and "--shallow-exclude=<tag>" options to make it easier to specify
 "I am interested only in the recent N months worth of history" and
 "Give me only the history since that version".

 would think.
