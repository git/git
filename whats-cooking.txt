What's cooking in git.git (Mar 2012, #04; Fri, 9)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.

Trivially correct fixes to old bugs may still graduate to 'master',
but otherwise we are mostly in "regression fixes only" mode until
1.7.10 final (see http://tinyurl.com/gitCal for schedule).

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches of the
repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* rs/unpack-trees-leakfix (2012-03-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-03-07 at 69a69cd)
 + unpack-trees: plug minor memory leak

* jh/apply-free-patch (2012-03-07) 1 commit
 - apply: do not leak patches and fragments

* az/verify-tag-use-gpg-config (2012-03-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-03-09 at d9e556f)
 + verify-tag: Parse GPG configuration options.

"git tag -s" honored "gpg.program" configuration variable since
1.7.9, but "git tag -v" and "git verify-tag" didn't.

This is a fairly low impact fix, and we may want to have it in
1.7.10.

* tb/maint-remove-irrelevant-i18n-test (2012-03-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-03-07 at 23f2dd1)
 + t0204: remove a test that checks undefined behaviour

I tentatively parked this in 'next' but later reverted the merge.

* jc/maint-undefined-i18n-observation-test (2012-03-09) 1 commit
 - t0204: clarify the "observe undefined behaviour" test

It was unclear what a test in t0204 wanted to check; it turns out
that it was only to observe an undefined behaviour of the system,
and did not anticipate one kind of reasonable error behaviour.

Replaces the tb/maint-remove-irrelevant-i18n-test topic.

* mm/push-default-switch-warning (2012-03-09) 1 commit
 - push: start warning upcoming default change for push.default

This resurrects an ancient patch I wrote during a discussion we had
in the 1.6.3-1.6.4 era.  It also conflicts with the long-stalled
jc/advise-push-default topic and for a good reason.  The latter is a
lower impact patch that uses a more focused approach to limit the
scope to the target audience that actually needs help.

* ph/rerere-doc (2012-03-08) 1 commit
 - rerere: Document 'rerere remaining'

* sl/customize-sane-tool-path (2012-03-09) 1 commit
 - configure: allow user to prevent $PATH "sanitization" on Solaris

Would be nice to hear from people who actually use autoconf, either
on Solaris or other platforms.

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* cn/pull-rebase-message (2012-03-04) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-03-04 at 5a6cd58)
 + Make git-{pull,rebase} message without tracking information friendlier

The advise message given when the user didn't give enough clue on what
to merge was overly long.

* jc/maint-diff-patch-header (2012-03-01) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-03-02 at 2cd2059)
 + diff -p: squelch "diff --git" header for stat-dirty paths
 + t4011: illustrate "diff-index -p" on stat-dirty paths
 + t4011: modernise style
 (this branch is used by jc/diff-ignore-mode.)

"diff-index" and friends showed "diff --git" header and nothing else
for a path that is only stat-dirty.

* jc/pickaxe-ignore-case (2012-03-04) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-03-04 at 1ad3a39)
 + ctype.c: Fix a sparse warning
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-03-02 at 73a632b)
 + pickaxe: allow -i to search in patch case-insensitively
 + grep: use static trans-case table

"git log -G/-S" pays attention to the "-i" option.

* jh/threadable-symlink-check (2012-03-02) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-03-05 at fdd667c)
 + Add threaded versions of functions in symlinks.c.

It probably is "threadble" not "threaded" but in any case this
should not regress the current callers.

* jl/maint-submodule-relative (2012-03-04) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-03-07 at e020e5c)
 + submodules: fix ambiguous absolute paths under Windows
 + submodules: refactor computation of relative gitdir path
 + submodules: always use a relative path from gitdir to work tree
 + submodules: always use a relative path to gitdir

The whole directory that houses a top-level superproject managed by
"git submodule" can be moved to another place.

* jn/maint-do-not-match-with-unsanitized-searchtext (2012-03-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-03-06 at 768ce21)
 + gitweb: Fix fixed string (non-regexp) project search

"gitweb" did use quotemeta() to prepare search string when asked to
do a fixed-string project search, but did not use it by mistake and
used the user-supplied string instead.

* kb/maint-prune-rmdir-closedir (2012-03-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-03-07 at 2438c9a)
 + fix deletion of .git/objects sub-directories in git-prune/repack

Call closedir() that iterates over a directory before rmdir() it.

* nl/http-proxy-auth (2012-03-02) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-03-04 at f368669)
 + http: support proxies that require authentication
 (this branch is used by nl/http-proxy-more.)

Allow curl-based transport to use proxies that require authentication.

* sl/modern-t0000 (2012-03-02) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-03-04 at 2cd1508)
 + t0000: modernise style

* th/mergetools-deltawalker (2012-03-05) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-03-05 at 167c74f)
 + mergetools: add a plug-in to support DeltaWalker

Add plug-in to support DeltaWalker in difftool/mergetool.  

* tr/maint-bundle-boundary (2012-03-01) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-03-02 at c25692f)
 + bundle: keep around names passed to add_pending_object()
 + t5510: ensure we stay in the toplevel test dir
 + t5510: refactor bundle->pack conversion

"git bundle" did not record boundary commits correctly when there
are many of them.

* vr/branch-doc (2012-03-06) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-03-06 at 6be3587)
 + Documentation/git-branch: add default for --contains
 + Documentation/git-branch: fix a typo
 + Documentation/git-branch: cleanups

Documentation update.

* zj/diff-stat-dyncol (2012-03-01) 10 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-03-01 at 79b4152)
 + diff --stat: add config option to limit graph width
 + diff --stat: enable limiting of the graph part
 + diff --stat: add a test for output with COLUMNS=40
 + diff --stat: use a maximum of 5/8 for the filename part
 + merge --stat: use the full terminal width
 + log --stat: use the full terminal width
 + show --stat: use the full terminal width
 + diff --stat: use the full terminal width
 + diff --stat: tests for long filenames and big change counts
 + Merge branches zj/decimal-width, zj/term-columns and jc/diff-stat-scaler

Rerolled again and looking good.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* dg/test-from-elsewhere (2012-03-04) 2 commits
 - Support out-of-tree Valgrind tests
 - Allow overriding GIT_BUILD_DIR

Better support for out-of-tree test scripts, but it appears that the
approach needs to be rethought.  By repointing TEST_DIRECTORY to a
directory other than $(pwd)/.., an out of place test script can reach
test helpers and freshly built Git relative to it (GIT_BUILD_DIR is
a mere short-hand for $TEST_DIRECTORY/..).

* nd/optim-connected (2012-02-29) 1 commit
 - Perform cheaper connectivity check when pack is used as medium

Cheats the local connectivity check performed by "git fetch"
slightly to gain some performance. This is a bit iffy.

* nd/columns (2012-02-28) 10 commits
 - tag: add --column
 - column: support piping stdout to external git-column process
 - status: add --column
 - branch: add --column
 - help: reuse print_columns() for help -a
 - column: add column.ui for default column output settings
 - column: add dense layout support
 - column: add columnar layout
 - Stop starting pager recursively
 - Add git-column for columnar display

Rerolled; the configuration handling looked iffy, but otherwise well
explained.

* hv/submodule-recurse-push (2012-02-13) 3 commits
 - push: teach --recurse-submodules the on-demand option
 - Refactor submodule push check to use string list instead of integer
 - Teach revision walking machinery to walk multiple times sequencially

The bottom one was not clearly explained and needs a reroll.

* jc/advise-push-default (2011-12-18) 1 commit
 - push: hint to use push.default=upstream when appropriate

Peff had a good suggestion outlining an updated code structure so
that somebody new can try to dip his or her toes in the development.
Any takers?

* jh/trace-use-startup-info (2012-03-02) 1 commit
 - Use startup_info->prefix rather than prefix.

I tend to agree with the doubt of the author of this patch expressed.

* ss/git-svn-prompt-sans-terminal (2012-01-04) 3 commits
 - fixup! 15eaaf4
 - git-svn, perl/Git.pm: extend Git::prompt helper for querying users
 - perl/Git.pm: "prompt" helper to honor GIT_ASKPASS and SSH_ASKPASS

The bottom one has been replaced with a rewrite based on comments
from Ævar. The second one needs more work, both in perl/Git.pm and
prompt.c, to give precedence to tty over SSH_ASKPASS when terminal
is available.

* jc/split-blob (2012-02-23) 7 commits
 - fixup?
 - chunked-object: streaming checkout
 - chunked-object: fallback checkout codepaths
 - bulk-checkin: support chunked-object encoding
 - bulk-checkin: allow the same data to be multiply hashed
 - new representation types in the packstream
 - varint-in-pack: refactor varint encoding/decoding

Not ready.

I finished the streaming checkout codepath, but as explained in
127b177 (bulk-checkin: support chunked-object encoding, 2011-11-30),
these are still early steps of a long and painful journey. At least
pack-objects and fsck need to learn the new encoding for the series
to be usable locally, and then index-pack/unpack-objects needs to
learn it to be used remotely.

Given that I heard a lot of noise that people want large files, and
that I was asked by somebody at GitTogether'11 privately for an
advice on how to pay developers (not me) to help adding necessary
support, I am somewhat dissapointed that the original patch series
that was sent almost two months ago still remains here without much
comments and updates from the developer community. I even made the
interface to the logic that decides where to split chunks easily
replaceable, and I deliberately made the logic in the original patch
extremely stupid to entice others, especially the "bup" fanboys, to
come up with a better logic, thinking that giving people an easy
target to shoot for, they may be encouraged to help out. The plan is
not working :-(.

* jc/fmt-merge-msg-people (2012-03-08) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-03-08 at be31aa9)
 + fmt-merge-msg.c: make util_as_int() return "int"
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-03-07 at 76fbac3)
 + fmt-merge-msg: finishing touches
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-03-05 at 38de349)
 + fmt-merge-msg: show those involved in a merged series

The "fmt-merge-msg" command learns to list the primary contributors
involved in the side topic you are merging.

Judging by the rate of "oops, this is better" fix-ups, it was good
that I decided to postpone this topic til the next cycle ;-)

* nl/http-proxy-more (2012-03-05) 3 commits
 - http: handle proxy authentication failure (error 407)
 - http: handle proxy proactive authentication
 - http: try http_proxy env var when http.proxy config option is not set

The code to talk to http proxies learn to use the same credential
API used to talk to the final http destinations.  It seems the
re-rolling has stalled since the last review?

* nd/stream-more (2012-03-07) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-03-07 at 7325922)
 + update-server-info: respect core.bigfilethreshold
 + fsck: use streaming API for writing lost-found blobs
 + show: use streaming API for showing blobs
 + parse_object: avoid putting whole blob in core
 + cat-file: use streaming API to print blobs
 + Add more large blob test cases
 + streaming: make streaming-write-entry to be more reusable

Use API to read blob data in smaller chunks in more places to
reduce the memory footprint.

* nd/threaded-index-pack (2012-03-02) 2 commits
 - index-pack: support multithreaded delta resolving
 - index-pack: split second pass obj handling into own function

Rerolled to fix a bug that was discovered with a trivial test, and
resurrected from Stalled category, but I am reluctant to advance a
topic that can easily break many people's repositories at this late
in the cycle.

What is queued here is a couple of review cycles old; will discard
and replace with a re-roll when it comes.
