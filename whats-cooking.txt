Subject: What's cooking in git.git (Jun 2016, #02; Mon, 6)

What's cooking in git.git (Jun 2016, #02; Mon, 6)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

The hopefully final release candidate 2.9-rc2 together with 2.8.4
has been pushed out.

By the way, the tip of 'pu' is not expected to pass its own test
suite, due to multiple broken topics queued near its tip. Earlier
there was a talk about automatically bisecting breakage on 'pu', but
tonight's pushout is a good illustration why that would not be very
useful.  What would be useful is (1) enumeration of commits on the
first parent chain on master..pu, (2) test of the second parent of
each of the commits found in (1), and (3) bisection between the
broken commits in (2) and 'master', which would highlight broken
topics and the commit(s) that might be responsible for each broken
topic.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

[Graduated to "master"]

* bd/readme.markdown-more (2016-05-31) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-06-02 at 1de7554)
 + README.md: format CLI commands with code syntax

 The mark-up in the top-level README.md file has been updated to
 typeset CLI command names differently from the body text.


* em/man-bold-literal (2016-05-31) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-06-02 at efb4156)
 + Documentation: bold literals in man

 The manpage output of our documentation did not render well in
 terminal; typeset literals in bold by default to make them stand
 out more.


* js/perf-rebase-i (2016-05-31) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-05-31 at 39d8dc8)
 + perf: make the tests work without a worktree

 The one in 'master' has a brown-paper-bag bug that breaks the perf
 test when used inside a usual Git repository with a working tree.


* js/rebase-i-dedup-call-to-rerere (2016-05-31) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-05-31 at db1f9e3)
 + rebase -i: remove an unnecessary 'rerere' invocation

 "git rebase -i", after it fails to auto-resolve the conflict, had
 an unnecessary call to "git rerere" from its very early days, which
 was spotted recently; the call has been removed.


* mm/makefile-developer-can-be-in-config-mak (2016-06-01) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-06-02 at f3a0678)
 + Makefile: add $(DEVELOPER_CFLAGS) variable
 + Makefile: move 'ifdef DEVELOPER' after config.mak* inclusion

 "make DEVELOPER=1" worked as expected; setting DEVELOPER=1 in
 config.mak didn't.


* mr/send-email-doc-gmail-2fa (2016-06-01) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-06-02 at cd2ade8)
 + Documentation/git-send-email: fix typo in gmail 2FA section

 Typofix.


* pa/cherry-pick-doc-typo (2016-05-29) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-06-02 at e2c2457)
 + git-cherry-pick.txt: correct a small typo

 "git cherry-pick --help" had three instances of word "behavior",
 one of which was spelled "behaviour", which is updated to match the
 other two.

 Code clean-up.


* sb/submodule-helper-list-signal-unmatch-via-exit-status (2016-06-01) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-06-02 at 29064a2)
 + submodule--helper: offer a consistent API
 (this branch is used by sb/submodule-helper-relative-path.)

 The way how "submodule--helper list" signals unmatch error to its
 callers has been updated.


* sb/submodule-helper-relative-path (2016-06-01) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-06-02 at 8a191e1)
 + submodule: remove bashism from shell script
 (this branch uses sb/submodule-helper-list-signal-unmatch-via-exit-status.)

 A bash-ism "local" has been removed from "git submodule" scripted
 Porcelain.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* wd/userdiff-css (2016-06-03) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-06-06 at 536102f)
 + userdiff: add built-in pattern for CSS

 Update the funcname definition to support css files.

 Will merge to 'master' after 2.9 final.


* jc/attr-more (2016-06-03) 2 commits
 - attr.c: pass struct git_attr_check down the callchain
 - attr.c: add push_stack() helper
 (this branch uses jc/attr; is tangled with sb/pathspec-label and sb/submodule-default-paths.)

 The beginning of long and tortuous journey to clean-up attribute
 subsystem implementation.


* jk/rev-list-count-with-bitmap (2016-06-03) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-06-06 at dd9b30f)
 + rev-list: disable bitmaps when "-n" is used with listing objects
 + rev-list: "adjust" results of "--count --use-bitmap-index -n"

 "git rev-list --count" whose walk-length is limited with "-n"
 option did not work well with the counting optimized to look at the
 bitmap index.

 Will merge to 'master' after 2.9 final.


* mh/ref-iterators (2016-06-03) 13 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-06-06 at c8e79dc)
 + for_each_reflog(): reimplement using iterators
 + dir_iterator: new API for iterating over a directory tree
 + for_each_reflog(): don't abort for bad references
 + do_for_each_ref(): reimplement using reference iteration
 + refs: introduce an iterator interface
 + ref_resolves_to_object(): new function
 + entry_resolves_to_object(): rename function from ref_resolves_to_object()
 + get_ref_cache(): only create an instance if there is a submodule
 + remote rm: handle symbolic refs correctly
 + delete_refs(): add a flags argument
 + refs: use name "prefix" consistently
 + do_for_each_ref(): move docstring to the header file
 + refs: remove unnecessary "extern" keywords
 (this branch uses mh/split-under-lock.)

 The API to iterate over all the refs (i.e. for_each_ref(), etc.)
 has been revamped.

 Will merge to 'master' after 2.9 final.


* ew/mboxrd-format-am (2016-06-06) 3 commits
 - am: support --patch-format=mboxrd
 - mailsplit: support unescaping mboxrd messages
 - pretty: support "mboxrd" output format

 Teach format-patch and mailsplit (hence "am") how a line that
 happens to begin with "From " in the e-mail message is quoted with
 ">", so that these lines can be restored to their original shape.


* lf/receive-pack-auto-gc-to-client (2016-06-06) 1 commit
 - receive-pack: send auto-gc output over sideband 2

 Allow messages that are generated by auto gc during "git push" on
 the receiving end to be explicitly passed back to the sending end
 over sideband, so that they are shown with "remote: " prefix to
 avoid confusing the users.


* mg/cherry-pick-multi-on-unborn (2016-06-06) 1 commit
 - cherry-pick: allow to pick to unborn branches

 "git cherry-pick A" worked on an unborn branch, but "git
 cherry-pick A..B" didn't.


* mj/log-show-signature-conf (2016-06-06) 2 commits
 - log: "--no-show-signature" commmand-line option
 - log: add "log.showsignature" configuration variable

 "git log" learns log.showSignature configuration variable, and a
 command line option "--no-show-signature" to countermand it.

 The order of the commits in the topic need to be reversed.


* nd/i-t-a-commitable (2016-06-06) 3 commits
 - commit: don't count i-t-a entries when checking if the new commit is empty
 - Resurrect "diff-lib.c: adjust position of i-t-a entries in diff"
 - diff.h: extend "flags" field to 64 bits because we're out of bits


* sg/reflog-past-root (2016-06-06) 1 commit
 - reflog: continue walking the reflog past root commits

 "git reflog" stopped upon seeing an entry that denotes a branch
 creation event (aka "unborn"), which made it appear as if the
 reflog was truncated.


* tb/complete-status (2016-06-06) 3 commits
 - completion: add git status
 - completion: add __git_get_option_value helper
 - completion: factor out untracked file modes into a variable

 The completion script (in contrib/) learned to complete "git
 status" options.


* tr/doc-tt (2016-06-06) 3 commits
 - doc: change configuration variables format
 - doc: change environment variables format
 - doc: clearer rule about formatting literals

 The documentation set has been updated so that literal commands,
 configuration variables and environment variables are consistently
 typeset in fixed-width font and bold in manpages.


* vs/prompt-avoid-unset-variable (2016-06-06) 1 commit
 - git-prompt.sh: Don't error on null ${ZSH,BASH}_VERSION, $short_sha

 The git-prompt scriptlet (in contrib/) was not friendly with those
 who uses "set -u", which has been fixed.


* rj/compat-regex-size-max-fix (2016-06-06) 1 commit
 - regex: fix a SIZE_MAX macro redefinition warning

 A compilation fix.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* bc/cocci-object-id (2016-06-06) 8 commits
 - merge-recursive: convert merge_recursive_generic to object_id
 - merge-recursive: convert leaf functions to use struct object_id
 - merge-recursive: convert struct merge_file_info to object_id
 - merge-recursive: convert struct stage_data to use object_id
 - Rename struct diff_filespec's sha1_valid member.
 - Convert struct diff_filespec to struct object_id
 - Apply standard object_id Coccinelle transformations.
 - Add basic Coccinelle transforms.

 Move from "unsigned char [20]" to "struct object_id" continues,
 with help from an automated tool.

 - bisect: write about `bisect next` in documentation

 The internal algorithm used in "git bisect" to find the next commit
 to check has been optimized greatly.

 Expecting a reroll.

* nd/shallow-deepen (2016-04-13) 26 commits
 - fetch, upload-pack: --deepen=N extends shallow boundary by N commits
 - upload-pack: add get_reachable_list()
 - upload-pack: split check_unreachable() in two, prep for get_reachable_list()
 - t5500, t5539: tests for shallow depth excluding a ref
 - clone: define shallow clone boundary with --shallow-exclude
 - fetch: define shallow boundary with --shallow-exclude
 - upload-pack: support define shallow boundary by excluding revisions
 - refs: add expand_ref()
 - t5500, t5539: tests for shallow depth since a specific date
 - clone: define shallow clone boundary based on time with --shallow-since
 - fetch: define shallow boundary with --shallow-since
 - upload-pack: add deepen-since to cut shallow repos based on time
 - shallow.c: implement a generic shallow boundary finder based on rev-list
 - fetch-pack: use a separate flag for fetch in deepening mode
 - fetch-pack.c: mark strings for translating
 - fetch-pack: use a common function for verbose printing
 - fetch-pack: use skip_prefix() instead of starts_with()
 - upload-pack: move rev-list code out of check_non_tip()
 - upload-pack: tighten number parsing at "deepen" lines
 - upload-pack: use skip_prefix() instead of starts_with()
 - upload-pack: move "unshallow" sending code out of deepen()
 - upload-pack: remove unused variable "backup"
 - upload-pack: move "shallow" sending code out of deepen()
 - upload-pack: move shallow deepen code out of receive_needs()
 - transport-helper.c: refactor set_helper_option()
 - remote-curl.c: convert fetch_git() to use argv_array

 The existing "git fetch --depth=<n>" option was hard to use
 correctly when making the history of an existing shallow clone
 deeper.  A new option, "--deepen=<n>", has been added to make this
 easier to use.  "git clone" also learned "--shallow-since=<date>"
 and "--shallow-exclude=<tag>" options to make it easier to specify
 "I am interested only in the recent N months worth of history" and
 "Give me only the history since that version".

 Needs review.

* az/p4-bare-no-rebase (2016-02-19) 1 commit
 - git-p4.py: Don't try to rebase on submit from bare repository

 "git p4 submit" attempts to do a rebase, which would fail if done
 in a bare repository.  Not doing this rebase would paper over the
 failure, which is what this patch does, but it is unclear what the
 side effect of not rebasing is.

 Needs a better explanation.


* nd/icase (2016-02-15) 12 commits
 - grep.c: reuse "icase" variable
 - diffcore-pickaxe: support case insensitive match on non-ascii
 - diffcore-pickaxe: "share" regex error handling code
 - grep/pcre: support utf-8
 - gettext: add is_utf8_locale()
 - grep/pcre: prepare locale-dependent tables for icase matching

 "git grep -i" has been taught to fold case in non-ascii locales.

 Needs review.

* ec/annotate-deleted (2015-11-20) 1 commit
 - annotate: skip checking working tree if a revision is provided

 Usability fix for annotate-specific "<file> <rev>" syntax with deleted
 files.

 Waiting for review.


* dg/subtree-rebase-test (2016-01-19) 1 commit
 - contrib/subtree: Add a test for subtree rebase that loses commits

 Reviewed up to v5.
 Will be rerolled.
 ($gmane/284426)


* js/am-3-merge-recursive-direct (2015-10-12) 2 commits
 - am: make a direct call to merge_recursive
 - merge_recursive_options: introduce the "gently" flag

 The merge_recursive_generic() function has been made a bit safer to
 call from inside a process.  "git am -3" was taught to make a direct
 call to the function when falling back to three-way merge.

 Being able to make a direct call would be good in general, but as a
 performance thing, the change needs to be backed up by numbers.

 I haven't gone through the "gently" change with fine toothed comb;
 I can see that the change avoids calling die(), but I haven't made
 sure that the program states (e.g. what's in the in-core index) are
 adjusted sensibly when it returns to the caller instead of dying,
 or the codepaths that used to die() are free of resource leaks.
 The original code certainly did not care the program states at the
 point of dying exactly because it knew it is going to exit, but now
 they have to care, and they need to be audited.

 Will be rerolled.

* dk/gc-more-wo-pack (2016-01-13) 4 commits
 - gc: clean garbage .bitmap files from pack dir
 - t5304: ensure non-garbage files are not deleted
 - t5304: test .bitmap garbage files
 - prepare_packed_git(): find more garbage

 Follow-on to dk/gc-idx-wo-pack topic, to clean up stale
 .bitmap and .keep files.

 Waiting for a reroll.

* jc/diff-b-m (2015-02-23) 5 commits
 . WIPWIP
 . WIP: diff-b-m
 - diffcore-rename: allow easier debugging
 - diffcore-rename.c: add locate_rename_src()
 - diffcore-break: allow debugging

 "git diff -B -M" produced incorrect patch when the postimage of a
 completely rewritten file is similar to the preimage of a removed
 file; such a resulting file must not be expressed as a rename from
 other place.

 The fix in this patch is broken, unfortunately.
 Will discard.


* jc/merge-impossible-no-commit (2016-04-26) 2 commits
 - merge: warn --no-commit merge when no new commit is created
 - merge: do not contaminate option_commit with --squash

 "git merge --no-commit" silently succeeded when there is no need to
 create any commit, either when you are more recent than the commit
 you tried to merge, or you can fast-forward to the commit you tried
 to merge.  The command gives a warning message in such cases.

 Just tying loose ends in a discussion.  Unless somebody else
 champions this topic, I'll drop it.

 Will discard.

 "git upload-pack" command has been updated to use the parse-options
 API.

 Will merge to 'master' after 2.9 final.


* jc/clear-pathspec (2016-06-02) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-06-06 at 9e7e291)
 + pathspec: rename free_pathspec() to clear_pathspec()

 We usually call a function that clears the contents a data
 structure X without freeing the structure itself clear_X(), and
 call a function that does clear_X() and also frees it free_X().
 free_pathspec() function has been renamed to clear_pathspec()
 to avoid confusion.

 Will merge to 'master' after 2.9 final.


* sb/submodule-recommend-shallowness (2016-05-27) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-05-31 at 1ee161c)
 + submodule update: learn `--[no-]recommend-shallow` option
 + submodule-config: keep shallow recommendation around

 An upstream project can make a recommendation to make only a
 shallow clone for some submodules in the .gitmodules file it ship.

 Will merge to 'master' after 2.9 final.


* tb/convert-peek-in-index (2016-05-24) 2 commits
 - convert: ce_compare_data() checks for a sha1 of a path

* dk/blame-move-no-reason-for-1-line-context (2016-05-29) 1 commit
 - blame: require 0 context lines while finding moved lines with -M

 "git blame -M" missed a single line that was moved within the file.

 We may want to squash a test or two to this commit.  Volunteers?


* nd/worktree-lock (2016-06-03) 6 commits
 - worktree.c: find_worktree() search by path suffix
 - worktree: add "unlock" command
 - worktree: add "lock" command
 - worktree.c: add is_worktree_locked()
 - worktree.c: add is_main_worktree()
 - worktree.c: add find_worktree()
 (this branch uses nd/worktree-cleanup-post-head-protection.)

 "git worktree prune" protected worktrees that are marked as
 "locked" by creating a file in a known location.  "git worktree"
 command learned a dedicated command pair to create and remoev such
 a file, so that the users do not have to do this with editor.

 Ok, folks, is everybody happy with this version?


* et/pretty-format-c-auto (2016-05-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-05-31 at 1e9c920)
 + format_commit_message: honor `color=auto` for `%C(auto)`

 %C(auto) in a custom format string that commands in `git log`
 family takes unconditionally turned the color on, ignoring
 --no-color or --color=auto with output not connected to a tty;
 this was corrected to make the format truly behave as "auto".

 Will merge to 'master' after 2.9 final.


* ew/daemon-socket-keepalive (2016-05-25) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-05-31 at c32acf1)
 + daemon: enable SO_KEEPALIVE for all sockets

 When "git daemon" is run without --[init-]timeout specified, a
 connection from a client that silently goes offline can hang around
 for a long time, wasting resources.  The socket-level KEEPALIVE has
 been enabled to allow the OS to notice such failed connections.

 + grep: -W: don't extend context to trailing empty lines
 + t7810: add test for grep -W and trailing empty context lines
 + xdiff: don't trim common tail with -W
 + xdiff: -W: don't include common trailing empty lines in context

 + xdiff: factor out match_func_rec()
 + t4051: rewrite, add more tests

 "git show -W" (extend hunks to cover the entire function, delimited
 by lines that match the "funcname" pattern) used to show the entire
 file when a change added an entire function at the end of the file,
 which has been fixed.

 The "git apply" standalone program is being libified; this is the
 first step to move many state variables into a structure that can
 be explicitly (re)initialized to make the machinery callable more
 than once.

 The next step that moves some remaining state variables into the
 structure and turns die()s into an error return that propagates up
 to the caller is not queued yet but in flight.  It would be good to
 review the above first and give the remainder of the series a solid
 base to build on.

 Will hold.

 + pathspec: disable preload-index when attribute pathspec magic is in use
 + pathspec: allow escaped query values
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-05-31 at e72b604)
 + pathspec: allow querying for attributes

 + pathspec: move long magic parsing out of prefix_pathspec
 + Documentation: fix a typo
 (this branch uses jc/attr; is tangled with jc/attr-more and sb/submodule-default-paths.)

 The pathspec mechanism learned ":(attr:X)$pattern" pathspec magic
 to limit paths that match $pattern further by attribute settings.
 The preload-index mechanism is disabled when the new pathspec magic
 is in use (at least for now), because the attribute subsystem is
 not thread-ready.

 - send-email: detect and offer to skip backup files

 A careless invocation of "git send-email directory/" after editing
 0001-change.patch with an editor often ends up sending both
 0001-change.patch and its backup file, 0001-change.patch~, causing
 embarrassment and a minor confusion.  Detect such an input and
 offer to skip the backup files when sending the patches out.

 Needs review.
