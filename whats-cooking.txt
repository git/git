What's cooking in git.git (Mar 2020, #10; Tue, 31)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

The 'next' branch has been rewound and rebuilt.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* ag/rebase-merge-allow-ff-under-abbrev-command (2020-03-30) 2 commits
 - t3432: test `--merge' with `rebase.abbreviateCommands = true', too
 - sequencer: don't abbreviate a command if it doesn't have a short form

 "git rebase" with the merge backend did not work well when the
 rebase.abbreviateCommands configuration was set.

 Will merge to 'next'.

* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2018-10-15) 1 commit
 - zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* dr/midx-avoid-int-underflow (2020-03-28) 1 commit
 - midx.c: fix an integer underflow

 When fed a midx that records no objects, some codepaths tried to
 loop from 0 through (num_objects-1), which, due to integer
 arithmetic wrapping around, made it nonsense operation with out of
 bounds array accesses.  The code has been corrected to reject such
 an midx file.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ak/run-command-on-cygwin-fix (2020-03-27) 1 commit
 - run-command: trigger PATH lookup properly on Cygwin

 Utitiles run via the run_command() API were not spawned correctly
 on Cygwin, when the paths to them are given as a full path with
 backslashes.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* dd/ci-musl-libc (2020-03-29) 3 commits
 - travis: build and test on Linux with musl libc and busybox
 - ci: refactor docker runner script
 - ci: libify logic for usage and checking CI_USER

 A new CI job to build and run test suite on linux with musl libc
 has been added.


* dr/doc-recurse-submodules (2020-03-27) 5 commits

 - doc: be more precise on (fetch|push).recurseSubmodules
 - doc: explain how to deactivate submodule.recurse completely

 - doc: list all commands affected by submodule.recurse

* dr/push-remoteref-fix (2020-03-27) 1 commit
 - remote.c: fix handling of %(push:remoteref)

 The "%(push:remoteref)" placeholder in the "--format=" argument of
 "git format-patch" (and friends) only showed what got explicitly
 configured, not what ref at the receiving end would be updated when
 "git push" was used, as it ignored the default behaviour (e.g. update
 the same ref as the source).

 Expecting a reroll.
 cf. <20200328222546.gvrtzkcazf3bhjno@doriath>


* jc/doc-test-leaving-early (2020-03-29) 1 commit
 - t/README: suggest how to leave test early with failure

 Document the recommended way to abort a failing test early (e.g. by
 exiting a loop), which is to say "return 1".

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/build-with-right-curl (2020-03-27) 2 commits

 - test-lib-functions: simplify packetize() stdin code
 - upload-pack: handle unexpected delim packets

 The server-end of the v2 protocol to serve "git clone" and "git
 fetch" was not prepared to see a delim packets at unexpected
 places, which led to a crash.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 - p5310: stop timing non-bitmap pack-to-disk

 - update-ref: read commands in a line-wise fashion
 - update-ref: move transaction handling into `update_refs_stdin()`
 - update-ref: pass end pointer instead of strbuf

 - update-ref: organize commands in an array
 - strbuf: provide function to append whole lines
 - git-update-ref.txt: add missing word
 - refs: fix segfault when aborting empty transaction

 "git update-ref --stdin" learned a handful of new verbs to let the
 user control ref update transactions more explicitly, which helps
 as an ingredient to implement two-phase commit-style atomic
 ref-updates across multiple repositories.

 Good start, but suspect not quite there yet.

* en/pull-do-not-rebase-after-fast-forwarding (2020-03-27) 1 commit
 - pull: avoid running both merge and rebase

 "git pull --rebase" tried to run a rebase even after noticing that
 the pull results in a fast-forward and no rebase is needed nor
 sensible, for the past few years due to a mistake nobody noticed.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 - pull: pass documented fetch options on
 - pull: remove --update-head-ok from documentation

 "git pull" shares many options with underlying "git fetch", but
 some of them were not documented and some of those that would make
 sense to pass down were not passed down.

 Will merge to 'next'.

* js/import-tars-do-not-make-phony-files-from-pax-headers (2020-03-24) 1 commit
 - import-tars: ignore the global PAX header

 The import-tars importer (in contrib/fast-import/) used to create
 phony files at the top-level of the repository when the archive
 contains global PAX headers, which made its own logic to detect and
 omit the common leading directory ineffective, which has been
 corrected.

 . Reftable support for git-core
 . Add reftable library
 . reftable: file format documentation
 . refs: document how ref_iterator_advance_fn should handle symrefs
 . create .git/refs in files-backend.c
 . refs.h: clarify reflog iteration order

 A new refs backend "reftable" to replace the traditional
 combination of packed-refs files and one-file-per-ref loose refs
 has been implemented and integrated for improved performance and
 atomicity.

 quickly enough to be merged down.

[Discarded]

* jc/rebase-backend-keep-old-default (2020-03-10) 1 commit
 . rebase: do not switch the default to 'merge' just yet

 The "merge" backend of "git rebase" still has a few bugs and
 unexpected behaviour that need to be ironed out before it becomes
 the default.  Let's switch the default back to the "apply" backend
 for now.


* vn/reset-deleted-ita (2019-07-26) 1 commit
 . reset: unstage empty deleted ita files

 "git reset HEAD [<pathspec>]" did not reset an empty file that was
