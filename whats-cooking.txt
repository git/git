What's cooking in git.git (Jan 2025, #05; Fri, 17)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and
aren't considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL
to a message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity (of course they can be resubmit when new interests
arise).

Git 2.48.1 and other maintenance releases have been tagged and
released.  A handful of topics that were marked with "Will discard?"
without seeing any further activity have been discarded.

There are quite a few topics that are listed here but without much
review activities.  I'll review the notes below with list archive
myself to see which ones are truly stale and discard them, maybe
later next week.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-scm/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

 remotes.

 Lazy-loading missing files in a blobless clone on demand is costly
 as it tends to be one-blob-at-a-time.  "git backfill" is introduced
 to help bulk-download necessary files beforehand.

* ps/send-pack-unhide-error-in-atomic-push (2024-11-14) 2 commits
 - transport: don't ignore git-receive-pack(1) exit code on atomic push
 - t5504: modernize test by moving heredocs into test bodies

 "git push --atomic --porcelain" used to ignore failures from the
 other side, losing the error status from the child process, which
 has been corrected.

 Needs to see if competing parallel topic needs to replace this one.

 to use an alternative path-hash function to improve delta-base
 selection to produce a packfile with deeper history than window
 size.
