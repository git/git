What's cooking in git.git (Jan 2026, #10)
-----------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and
aren't considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL
to a message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity (of course they can be resubmit when new interests
arise).

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

Git 2.53-rc2 has been tagged, with one topic reverted recently due
to a regression. Please keep hunting for regressions.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-scm/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

[New Topics]

* jc/checkout-switch-restore (2026-01-29) 2 commits
 - checkout: tell "parse_remote_branch" which command is calling it
 - checkout: pass program-readable token to unified "main"

 "git switch <name>", in an attempt to create a local branch <name>
 after a remote tracking branch of the same name gave an advise
 message to disambiguate using "git checkout", which has been
 updated to use "git switch".

* jt/odb-transaction-per-source (2026-01-28) 4 commits
 - odb: transparently handle common transaction behavior
 - odb: prepare `struct odb_transaction` to support more sources
 - object-file: rename transaction functions
 - odb: store ODB source in `struct odb_transaction`

 Transaction to create objects (or not) is currently tied to the
 repository, but in the future a repository can have multiple object
 sources, which may have different transaction mechanisms.  Make the
 odb transaction API per object source.

* dw/config-global-list (2025-10-09) 4 commits
 . config: keep bailing on unreadable global files
 . config: read global scope via config_sequence
 . config: test home and xdg files in `list --global`
 . cleanup_path: force forward slashes on Windows

 "git config --list --global", unlike "git config --list", did not
 consult both of the two possible per-user sources of the
 configuration files, i.e. $HOME/.gitconfig and the XDG one, which
 has been corrected.

 Will discard. Has been waiting for a reroll for too long.

* jc/exclude-with-gitignore (2025-11-04) 1 commit
 . dir.c: do not be fooled by :(exclude) pathspec elements

 "git add ':(exclude)foo.o'" is clearly a request not to add 'foo.o',
 but the command complained about listing an ignored path foo.o on
 the command line, which has been corrected.

 . fsck: use parse_unsigned_from_buf() for parsing timestamp
 . cache-tree: use parse_int_from_buf()
 . parse: add functions for parsing from non-string buffers
 . parse: prefer bool to int for boolean returns
 . Merge branch 'jk/asan-bonanza' into jk/parse-int

 Introduce a more robust way to parse a decimal integer stored in a
 piece of memory that is not necessarily terminated with NUL (which
 Asan strict-string-check complains even when use of strtol() is
 safe due to varified existence of whitespace after the digits).

 references in which directory is introduced, which would likely to
 be useful during ref migration.
