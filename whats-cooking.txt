What's cooking in git.git (Nov 2025, #07; Sun, 23)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and
aren't considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL
to a message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity (of course they can be resubmit when new interests
arise).

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-scm/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

 As "git diff --quiet" only cares about the existence of any
 changes, disable rename/copy detection to skip more expensive
 processing whose result will be discarded anyway.

 - reference-transaction: use hook API instead of run-command
 - hook: allow overriding the ungroup option
 - transport: convert pre-push to hook API
 - hook: convert 'post-rewrite' hook in sequencer.c to hook API
 - hook: provide stdin via callback
 - run-command: add stdin callback for parallelization

 Use hook API to replace ad-hoc invocation of hook scripts with the
 run_command() API.

 Seems to leak and break CI

* sa/replay-atomic-ref-updates (2025-11-05) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2025-11-19 at ae19b06a22)
 + replay: add replay.refAction config option
 + replay: make atomic ref updates the default behavior
 + replay: use die_for_incompatible_opt2() for option validation
 (this branch is used by ps/history.)

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2025-11-18

 "git replay" (experimental) learned to perform ref updates itself
 in a transaction by default, instead of emitting where each refs
 should point at and leaving the actual update to another command.

 Will merge to 'master'.

* ar/submodule-gitdir-tweak (2025-11-19) 7 commits
 - meson/Makefile: allow setting submodule encoding at build time
 - submodule: use hashed name for gitdir
 - submodule: fix case-folding gitdir filesystem colisions
 - submodule: add extension to encode gitdir paths
 - submodule: always validate gitdirs inside submodule_name_to_gitdir
 - builtin/credential-store: move is_rfc3986_unreserved to url.[ch]
 - submodule--helper: use submodule_name_to_gitdir in add_submodule

 Avoid local submodule repository directory paths overlapping with
 each other by encoding submodule names before using them as path
 components.
