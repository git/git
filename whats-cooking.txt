Subject: What's cooking in git.git (Aug 2012, #06; Sun, 19)
X-master-at: 889d35899ba64640e47798681ecb34a4be043bad

What's cooking in git.git (Aug 2012, #06; Sun, 19)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.

Now 1.7.12 is out, we will have a few days of calming down period on
the 'master' front, just in case we have to deal with brown paper
bag post-release fixes, and then start getting the topics that have
been cooking on the 'next' branch graduate to the 'master', perhaps
starting on coming Wednesday.

For this cycle, we already have fairly well cooked topics, many of
which are on 'next', and the git-svn updates for svn 1.7 by Michael
G Schwern is also a candidate for early graduation, provided if Eric
is OK with the series (I'd need to double check with him).  There
also were some topics that were almost there already during their
review discussions but somehow lost momentum when we got distracted,
and I think most of them would be ready fairly quickly if the
respective owners of the topics (you know who you are) can find time
to put some work into them.

So I'm planning to keep this cycle reasonably short and aim for
tagging the result as 1.8.0 at the end of 9th week, on October 21st,
after which I'd disappear for a few weeks.
http://tinyurl.com/gitCal is where you can always find my rough
tagging schedule at.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches of the
repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* kk/maint-for-each-ref-multi-sort (2012-08-19) 2 commits
 - for-each-ref: Fix sort with multiple keys
 - t6300: test sort with multiple keys

A small and sensible fix, even though the accompanying test seems to
touch too many unrelated existing ones needlessly, which may want to
be fixed by a reroll.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* mz/rebase-range (2012-07-18) 7 commits
 . rebase (without -p): correctly calculate patches to rebase
 . rebase -p: don't request --left-right only to ignore left side
 . rebase -p: use --cherry-mark for todo file
 . git-rebase--interactive.sh: look up subject in add_pick_line
 . git-rebase--interactive: group all $preserve_merges code
 . git-rebase--interactive.sh: extract function for adding "pick" line
 . git-rebase--am.sh: avoid special-casing --keep-empty

Expecting a reroll.

Performance concerns from Windows folks.  Also the series lacks
proper sign-offs.

* jl/submodule-rm (2012-07-05) 2 commits
 - rm: remove submodules from the index and the .gitmodules file
 - rm: don't fail when removing populated submodules

Expecting a reroll.

* lt/commit-tree-guess-utf-8 (2012-06-28) 1 commit
 - commit/commit-tree: correct latin1 to utf-8

Teaches "git commit" and "git commit-tree" the "we are told to use
utf-8 in log message, but this does not look like utf-8---attempt to
pass it through convert-from-latin1-to-utf8 and see if it makes
sense" heuristics "git mailinfo" already uses.

A draft from Linus received privately without a log message.
Expecting a reroll.

* mb/remote-default-nn-origin (2012-07-11) 6 commits
 - Teach get_default_remote to respect remote.default.
 - Test that plain "git fetch" uses remote.default when on a detached HEAD.
 - Teach clone to set remote.default.
 - Teach "git remote" about remote.default.
 - Teach remote.c about the remote.default configuration setting.
 - Rename remote.c's default_remote_name static variables.

When the user does not specify what remote to interact with, we
often attempt to use 'origin'.  This can now be customized via a
configuration variable.

Expecting a reroll.
"The first remote becomes the default" bit is better done as a
separate step.

* jc/split-blob (2012-04-03) 6 commits
 - chunked-object: streaming checkout
 - chunked-object: fallback checkout codepaths
 - bulk-checkin: support chunked-object encoding
 - bulk-checkin: allow the same data to be multiply hashed
 - new representation types in the packstream
 - packfile: use varint functions

Not ready.

I finished the streaming checkout codepath, but as explained in
127b177 (bulk-checkin: support chunked-object encoding, 2011-11-30),
these are still early steps of a long and painful journey. At least
pack-objects and fsck need to learn the new encoding for the series
to be usable locally, and then index-pack/unpack-objects needs to
learn it to be used remotely.

Given that I heard a lot of noise that people want large files, and
that I was asked by somebody at GitTogether'11 privately for an
advice on how to pay developers (not me) to help adding necessary
support, I am somewhat dissapointed that the original patch series
that was sent long time ago still remains here without much comments
and updates from the developer community. I even made the interface
to the logic that decides where to split chunks easily replaceable,
and I deliberately made the logic in the original patch extremely
stupid to entice others, especially the "bup" fanbois, to come up
with a better logic, thinking that giving people an easy target to
shoot for, they may be encouraged to help out. The plan is not
working :-<.

* hv/coding-guidelines (2012-08-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-08-18 at 5a78f2c)
 + Documentation/CodingGuidelines: spell out more shell guidelines

In earlier days, "imitate the style in the neibouring code" was
sufficient to keep the coherent style, but over time some parts of
the codebase have drifted enough to make it ineffective.

Will merge to 'master' as part of the first batch.

* jc/daemon-access-hook (2012-08-15) 1 commit
 - daemon: --access-hook option

Allow an external command to tell git-daemon to decline service
based on the client address, repository path, etc.

Will merge to 'next'.

* jc/send-email-reconfirm (2012-08-14) 1 commit
 - send-email: validate & reconfirm interactive responses

Validate interactive input to "git send-email" to avoid common
mistakes such as saying "y<RETURN>" to sender mail address whose
prompt is given with a correctly guessed default.

Will merge to 'next'.

* pw/p4-submit-conflicts (2012-08-16) 12 commits
 - git p4: add submit --prepare-p4-only option
 - git p4: add submit --dry-run option
 - git p4: accept -v for --verbose
 - git p4: revert deleted files after submit cancel
 - git p4: rearrange submit template construction
 - git p4: test clean-up after failed submit, fix added files
 - git p4: standardize submit cancel due to unchanged template
 - git p4: move conflict prompt into run, use [c]ontinue and [q]uit
 - git p4: remove submit failure options [a]pply and [w]rite
 - git p4: gracefully fail if some commits could not be applied
 - git p4 test: use p4d -L option to suppress log messages
 - git p4 test: remove bash-ism of combined export/assignment

I saw Pete and Luke going back and forth collaborating, so I take
that this may still be rerolled---if not, please holler.

* tx/relative-in-the-future (2012-08-16) 2 commits
 - date: show relative dates in the future
 - date: refactor the relative date logic from presentation

Not my itch; rewritten an earlier submission by Tom Xue into
somewhat more maintainable form, though it breaks existing i18n.

* ef/win32-cred-helper (2012-08-16) 1 commit
 - contrib: add win32 credential-helper

Credential helper for Win32 (is this GUI???).

Will merge to 'next'.

* jc/maint-abbrev-option-cli (2012-08-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-08-18 at e002006)
 + gitcli: describe abbreviation of long options

We did not document that many commands take unique prefix
abbreviations of long options (e.g. "--option" may be the only flag
that the command accepts that begin with "--opt", in which case you
can give "--opt") anywhere easy to find for new people.

Will merge to 'master' as part of the first batch.

* mv/pull-r-for-rebase (2012-08-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-08-18 at e7d885b)
 + man: git pull -r is a short for --rebase

Minor documentation update.

Will merge to 'master' as part of the first batch.

* rr/precompose-utf8-cleanup (2012-08-17) 1 commit
 - cleanup precompose_utf8

A style and code cleanup.
Will merge to 'next'.

* jc/doc-git-updates (2012-08-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-08-18 at f24913b)
 + Documentation: update the introductory section

Will merge to 'master' as part of the first batch.

* fa/remote-svn (2012-08-17) 16 commits
 - Add a test script for remote-svn
 - remote-svn: add marks-file regeneration
 - Add a svnrdump-simulator replaying a dump file for testing
 - remote-svn: add incremental import
 - remote-svn: Activate import/export-marks for fast-import
 - Create a note for every imported commit containing svn metadata
 - vcs-svn: add fast_export_note to create notes
 - Allow reading svn dumps from files via file:// urls
 - remote-svn, vcs-svn: Enable fetching to private refs
 - When debug==1, start fast-import with "--stats" instead of "--quiet"
 - Add documentation for the 'bidi-import' capability of remote-helpers
 - Connect fast-import to the remote-helper via pipe, adding 'bidi-import' capability
 - Add argv_array_detach and argv_array_free_detached
 - Add svndump_init_fd to allow reading dumps from arbitrary FDs
 - Integrate remote-svn into svn-fe/Makefile
 - Implement a remote helper for svn in C
 (this branch is used by fa/vcs-svn.)

* fa/vcs-svn (2012-08-18) 7 commits
 - fixup: add missing cast to vcs-svn/fast_export.c
 - fixup - no old style defn
 - vcs-svn: remove repo_tree
 - vcs-svn/svndump: rewrite handle_node(), begin|end_revision()
 - vcs-svn/svndump: restructure node_ctx, rev_ctx handling
 - svndump: move struct definitions to .h
 - vcs-svn: Add sha1 calculation to fast_export and line_buffer
 (this branch uses fa/remote-svn.)

I haven't seen many comments and reviews from people involved in the
area, other than DBarr's worries on teaching exporter (which is
supposed to be Git agnostic, as its output "fast-import" format is
meant to be usable by others) to compute object names in Git way.

It is somewhat hard for me to judge these two series.

* mh/maint-config-doc-proxy-command (2012-08-18) 2 commits
 - git-config doc: unconfuse an example
 - git-config.txt: fix example

Will merge to 'next'.

* ph/stash-rerere (2012-08-17) 2 commits
 - stash: invoke rerere in case of conflict
 - test: git-stash conflict sets up rerere

"git stash" internally used "git merge-recursive" backend, which did
not trigger "rerere" upon conflicts unlike other mergy operations.

Will merge to 'next'.

* hv/submodule-path-unmatch (2012-08-14) 1 commit
 - Let submodule command exit with error status if path does not exist

As the title says.
Will merge to 'next'.

* jc/add-delete-default (2012-08-13) 1 commit
 - git add: notice removal of tracked paths by default

"git add dir/" updated modified files and added new files, but does
not notice removed files, which may be "Huh?" to some users.  They
can of course use "git add -A dir/", but why should they?

Resurrected from graveyard, as I thought it was a worthwhile thing
to do in the longer term; waiting for comments.

* jc/maint-rev-list-topo-doc (2012-08-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-08-18 at d1f54d9)
 + rev-list docs: clarify --topo-order description

It was unclear what "--topo-order" was really about in the
documentation. It is not just about "children before parent", but
also about "don't mix lineages".

Will merge to 'master' as part of the first batch.

* bc/receive-pack-stdout-protection (2012-08-06) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-08-07 at d7aa316)
 + receive-pack: do not leak output from auto-gc to standard output
 + t/t5400: demonstrate breakage caused by informational message from prune

When "git push" triggered the automatic gc on the receiving end, a
message from "git prune" that said it was removing cruft leaked to
the standard output, breaking the communication protocol.

Will merge to 'master' as part of the second batch.

* bc/prune-info (2012-08-07) 1 commit
 - prune.c: only print informational message in show_only or verbose mode

Teach "git prune" without "-v" to be silent about leftover temporary files.

Will merge to 'next'.

* jc/tag-doc (2012-08-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-08-18 at 9fe64b2)
 + Documentation: do not mention .git/refs/* directories

Our documentation used to assume having files in .git/refs/*
directories was the only to have branches and tags, but that is not
true for quite some time.

Will merge to 'master' as part of the first batch.

* jk/docs-docbook-monospace-display (2012-08-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-08-18 at 7e02bf8)
 + docs: monospace listings in docbook output

The documentation in the TeXinfo format was using indented output
for materials meant to be examples that are better typeset in
monospace.

Will merge to 'master' as part of the second batch.

* jc/maint-protect-sh-from-ifs (2012-08-08) 1 commit
 - sh-setup: protect from exported IFS

When the user exports a non-default IFS without HT, scripts that
rely on being able to parse "ls-files -s | while read a b c..."
start to fail.  Protect them from such a misconfiguration.

Will merge to 'next'.

* jk/check-docs-update (2012-08-08) 8 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-08-18 at 4409d2e)

 + check-docs: drop git-help special-case
 + check-docs: list git-gui as a command
 + check-docs: factor out command-list
 + command-list: mention git-credential-* helpers
 + command-list: add git-sh-i18n
 + check-docs: update non-command documentation list
 + check-docs: mention gitweb specially

Simplify "make check-docs" implementation and update its coverage.

Will merge to 'master' as part of the first batch.

* js/gitweb-path-info-unquote (2012-08-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-08-15 at 844da17)
 + gitweb: URL-decode $my_url/$my_uri when stripping PATH_INFO

Stripping of PATH_INFO in gitweb did not take url style quoting into
account, failing to notice directories with funny characters e.g. SP
in their paths.

Will merge to 'master' as part of the first batch.

* mg/rebase-i-onto-reflog-in-full (2012-08-10) 1 commit
 - rebase -i: use full onto sha1 in reflog

The reflog entries left by "git rebase" and "git rebase -i" were
inconsistent.

Will merge to 'next'.

* mz/empty-rebase-test (2012-08-09) 1 commit

Will merge to 'next'.

* jc/capabilities (2012-08-13) 3 commits
 - fetch-pack: mention server version with verbose output
 - parse_feature_request: make it easier to see feature values
 - fetch-pack: do not ask for unadvertised capabilities
 (this branch uses jk/version-string.)

Some capabilities were asked by fetch-pack even when upload-pack did
not advertise that they are available.  Fix fetch-pack not to do so.

Will merge to 'next'.

* pw/p4-use-client-spec-branch-detection (2012-08-11) 5 commits
 - git p4: make branch detection work with --use-client-spec

Will merge to 'next' and soon to 'master'.

* jc/maint-push-refs-all (2012-08-07) 2 commits
 - get_fetch_map(): tighten checks on dest refs
 - fetch/push: allow refs/*:refs/*

Allows pushing and fetching refs/stash.
Need to send it out to the list for review.

* jk/version-string (2012-08-10) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-08-10 at d8dcb00)
 + do not send client agent unless server does first
 + send-pack: fix capability-sending logic
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-08-09 at 64dc91b)
 + include agent identifier in capability string
 (this branch is used by jc/capabilities.)

Leftover bits from the "git version" code restructuring, that give
us an ability to expose the Git version over the wire in the
protocol exchange. But we do so carefully only to the other end that
understands it.

Will merge to 'master' as part of the third batch.

* js/grep-patterntype-config (2012-08-03) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-08-09 at 1a08d6c)
 + grep: add a grep.patternType configuration setting

"grep" learned to use a non-standard pattern type by default if a
configuration variable tells it to.

Will merge to 'master' as part of the second batch.

* mk/test-seq (2012-08-04) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-08-06 at 3f6917c)

Add a compatibility/utility function to the test framework. 

Will merge to 'master' as part of the first batch.

* ab/diff-write-incomplete-line (2012-08-05) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-08-07 at dcf02ae)
 + Fix '\ No newline...' annotation in rewrite diffs
 (this branch uses mk/test-seq.)

The output from "git diff -B" for a file that ends with an
incomplete line did not put "\ No newline..." on a line of its own.

Will merge to 'master' as part of the second batch.

* pg/maint-apply-remove-unused-variable (2012-08-05) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-08-05 at aa9f5e9)

A GSoC project, queued here primarily to give people an easier
access to the state of the last posted version.

* nd/index-errno (2012-08-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-08-06 at a9f2101)
 + read_index_from: remove bogus errno assignments

Assignments to errno before calling system functions that used to
matter in the old code were left behind after the code structure
changed sufficiently to make them useless.

* jc/maint-sane-execvp-notdir (2012-07-31) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-08-09 at 5dd4240)
 + sane_execvp(): ignore non-directory on $PATH

"git foo" errored out with "Not a directory" when the user had a non
directory on $PATH, and worse yet it masked an alias "foo" to run.

Will merge to 'master' as part of the third batch.

* jc/sanitize-nkd-lazy-iconv-open (2012-07-31) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-08-09 at 832c238)
 + macos: lazily initialize iconv

Teach the code that works around NKD/NKC gotcha on MacOS to call
iconv_open() only when it is necessary, in the hope of avoiding
set-up overhead.

Needs some work to rename functions
as mentioned by Linus in the discussion.

* tr/maint-send-email-2047 (2012-07-31) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-08-09 at 17dfe57)
 + send-email: improve RFC2047 quote parsing

"git send-email" did not unquote encoded words that appear on the
header correctly, and lost "_" from strings.

Will merge to 'master' as part of the first batch.

* cw/cherry-pick-allow-empty-message (2012-08-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-08-09 at eab95f6)
 + cherry-pick: add --allow-empty-message option

"git cherry-pick" by default stops when it sees a commit without any
log message.  The "--allow-empty-message" option can be used to
silently proceed.

 + diff: do not use null sha1 as a sentinel value
 (this branch is used by jk/maint-null-in-trees.)

"git diff" had a confusion between taking data from a path in the
working tree and taking data from an object that happens to have
name 0{40} recorded in a tree.

 - cherry: remove redundant check for merge commit
 - cherry: don't set ignored rev_info options

  (merged to 'next' on 2012-07-30 at 8392da9)
 + config: "git config baa" should exit with status 1

The exit status code from "git config" was way overspecified while
being incorrect.  Update the implementation to give the documented
status for a case that was documented, and introduce a new code for
"all other errors".

Will merge to 'master' as part of the third batch.

 (this branch uses jk/maint-diff-nul40-as-sentinel.)

We do not want a link to 0{40} object stored anywhere in our objects.

Will merge to 'master' as part of the second batch.

 + test-lib: provide case insensitivity as a prerequisite
 + test: allow prerequisite to be evaluated lazily
 + test: rename $satisfied to $satisfied_prereq

Teaches the test framework to probe rarely used prerequistes lazily,

NKD/NKC MacOS x gotcha.

Will merge to 'master' as part of the first batch.
