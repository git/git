What's cooking in git.git (Nov 2010, #01; Tue, 9)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones
marked with '.' do not appear in any of the integration branches, but I am
still holding onto them.

Many topics have been cooking for a while in 'next', some of them for too
long.  Tonight's pushout is fairly large, and the result makes the set of
remaining topics on 'next' very thin.  A few people sent series based on
'next'; that was not a pleasant experience for me to try separating them
out, but I am in no position to complain---all of the topics that have
been cooking for a very long time are long overdue.

--------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* nd/index-doc (2010-09-06) 1 commit

Half-written but it is a good start.  I may need to give some help in
describing more recent index extensions.

* cb/ignored-paths-are-precious (2010-08-21) 1 commit
 - checkout/merge: optionally fail operation when ignored files need to be overwritten

This needs tests; also we know of longstanding bugs in related area that
needs to be addressed---they do not have to be part of this series but
their reproduction recipe would belong to the test script for this topic.

It would hurt users to make the new feature on by default, especially the
ones with subdirectories that come and go.

* jk/tag-contains (2010-07-05) 4 commits
 - Why is "git tag --contains" so slow?
 - default core.clockskew variable to one day
 - limit "contains" traversals based on commit timestamp
 - tag: speed up --contains calculation

The idea of the bottom one is probably Ok, except that the use of object
flags needs to be rethought, or at least the helper needs to be moved to
builtin/tag.c to make it clear that it should not be used outside the
current usage context.
