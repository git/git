What's cooking in git.git (Jun 2018, #06; Mon, 25)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

Git 2.18 turned out to be an unusually large release in the recent
history, with 900+ individual changes, compared to ~500 for a few
releases before that.  Thanks, everybody who participated.

The tip of 'next' hasn't been rewound yet, but I've already reverted
merges of a few topics from there to give them a fresh restart.  

I haven't annotated many topics still in 'pu' with short-term plans
and my assessment on their done-ness.  Comments and review summaries
to help deciding are appreciated.  I'd like to start accepting new
topics only after getting the classification more-or-less right for
the topics already in flight.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

[Graduated to "master"]

* ag/rebase-p (2018-06-01) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-06-13 at dd6f8a51d7)
 + rebase: remove -p code from git-rebase--interactive.sh
 + rebase: use the new git-rebase--preserve-merges.sh
 + rebase: strip unused code in git-rebase--preserve-merges.sh
 + rebase: introduce a dedicated backend for --preserve-merges
 (this branch is used by ag/rebase-i-append-todo-help and ag/rebase-i-rewrite-todo.)

 Separate "rebase -p" codepath out of "rebase -i" implementation to
 slim down the latter and make it easier to manage.


* cc/tests-without-assuming-ref-files-backend (2018-06-04) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-06-13 at 7e2f74431c)
 + t9104: kosherly remove remote refs

 Instead of mucking with filesystem directly, use plumbing commands
 update-ref etc. to manipulate the refs in the tests.


* ds/commit-graph-lockfile-fix (2018-05-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-24 at 3d12a02b0c)
 + commit-graph: fix UX issue when .lock file exists
 (this branch is used by ds/commit-graph-fsck; uses ds/generation-numbers.)

 Update to ds/generation-numbers topic.


* ds/generation-numbers (2018-05-22) 11 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-24 at 56fc38a1b6)
 + commit-graph.txt: update design document
 + merge: check config before loading commits
 + commit: use generation number in remove_redundant()
 + commit: add short-circuit to paint_down_to_common()
 + commit: use generation numbers for in_merge_bases()
 + ref-filter: use generation number for --contains
 + commit-graph: always load commit-graph information
 + commit: use generations in paint_down_to_common()
 + commit-graph: compute generation numbers
 + commit: add generation number to struct commit
 + ref-filter: fix outdated comment on in_commit_list
 (this branch is used by ds/commit-graph-fsck and ds/commit-graph-lockfile-fix.)

 A recently added "commit-graph" datafile has learned to store
 pre-computed generation numbers to speed up the decisions to stop
 history traversal.


* en/merge-recursive-tests (2018-05-28) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-06-01 at 8490b560b4)
 + t6036: prefer test_when_finished to manual cleanup in following test
 + t6036, t6042: prefer test_cmp to sequences of test
 + t6036, t6042: prefer test_path_is_file, test_path_is_missing
 + t6036, t6042: use test_line_count instead of wc -l
 + t6036, t6042: use test_create_repo to keep tests independent

 Clean up tests in t6xxx series about 'merge' command.


* en/rename-directory-detection-reboot (2018-06-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-06-18 at 95c454d3f4)
 + merge-recursive: use xstrdup() instead of fixed buffer

 Newly added codepath in merge-recursive had potential buffer
 overrun, which has been fixed.


* jk/show-index (2018-05-29) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-06-01 at 4b3382d994)
 + show-index: update documentation for index v2
 + make show-index a builtin

 Modernize a less often used command.


* ls/complete-remote-update-names (2018-06-01) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-06-13 at 86b4d23278)
 + completion: complete remote names too

 "git remote update" can take both a single remote nickname and a
 nickname for remote groups, and the completion script (in contrib/)
 has been taught about it.


* nd/commit-util-to-slab (2018-05-21) 15 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-24 at bb5643d75c)
 + commit.h: delete 'util' field in struct commit
 + merge: use commit-slab in merge remote desc instead of commit->util
 + log: use commit-slab in prepare_bases() instead of commit->util
 + show-branch: note about its object flags usage
 + show-branch: use commit-slab for commit-name instead of commit->util
 + name-rev: use commit-slab for rev-name instead of commit->util
 + bisect.c: use commit-slab for commit weight instead of commit->util
 + revision.c: use commit-slab for show_source
 + sequencer.c: use commit-slab to associate todo items to commits
 + sequencer.c: use commit-slab to mark seen commits
 + shallow.c: use commit-slab for commit depth instead of commit->util
 + describe: use commit-slab for commit names instead of commit->util
 + blame: use commit-slab for blame suspects instead of commit->util
 + commit-slab: support shared commit-slab
 + commit-slab.h: code split

 The in-core "commit" object had an all-purpose "void *util" field,
 which was tricky to use especially in library-ish part of the
 code.  All of the existing uses of the field has been migrated to a
 more dedicated "commit-slab" mechanism and the field is eliminated.


* nd/complete-config-vars (2018-05-29) 13 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-06-13 at c2dd5546d0)
 + completion: complete general config vars in two steps
 + log-tree: allow to customize 'grafted' color
 + completion: support case-insensitive config vars
 + completion: keep other config var completion in camelCase
 + completion: drop the hard coded list of config vars
 + am: move advice.amWorkDir parsing back to advice.c
 + advice: keep config name in camelCase in advice_config[]
 + fsck: produce camelCase config key names
 + help: add --config to list all available config
 + fsck: factor out msg_id_info[] lazy initialization code
 + grep: keep all colors in an array
 + Add and use generic name->id mapping code for color slot parsing
 + Merge branch 'nd/command-list' into nd/complete-config-vars

 Continuing with the idea to programatically enumerate various
 pieces of data required for command line completion, teach the
 codebase to report the list of configuration variables
 subcommands care about to help complete them.


* nd/diff-apply-ita (2018-05-29) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-30 at f98728de81)
 + apply: add --intent-to-add
 + t2203: add a test about "diff HEAD" case
 + diff: turn --ita-invisible-in-index on by default
 + diff: ignore --ita-[in]visible-in-index when diffing worktree-to-tree

 "git diff" compares the index and the working tree.  For paths
 added with intent-to-add bit, the command shows the full contents
 of them as added, but the paths themselves were not marked as new
 files.  They are now shown as new by default.

 "git apply" learned the "--intent-to-add" option so that an
 otherwise working-tree-only application of a patch will add new
 paths to the index marked with the "intent-to-add" bit.


* nd/reject-empty-shallow-request (2018-06-04) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-06-13 at d6b6a1c3a7)
 + upload-pack: reject shallow requests that would return nothing

 "git fetch --shallow-since=<cutoff>" that specifies the cut-off
 point that is newer than the existing history used to end up
 grabbing the entire history.  Such a request now errors out.


* pc/submodule-helper-foreach (2018-05-11) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-22 at f22659ad46)
 + submodule: port submodule subcommand 'foreach' from shell to C
 + submodule foreach: document variable '$displaypath'
 + submodule foreach: document '$sm_path' instead of '$path'
 + submodule foreach: correct '$path' in nested submodules from a subdirectory

 The bulk of "git submodule foreach" has been rewritten in C.


* sb/object-store-alloc (2018-05-16) 13 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-06-13 at 2868c2db9d)
 + alloc: allow arbitrary repositories for alloc functions
 + object: allow create_object to handle arbitrary repositories
 + object: allow grow_object_hash to handle arbitrary repositories
 + alloc: add repository argument to alloc_commit_index
 + alloc: add repository argument to alloc_report
 + alloc: add repository argument to alloc_object_node
 + alloc: add repository argument to alloc_tag_node
 + alloc: add repository argument to alloc_commit_node
 + alloc: add repository argument to alloc_tree_node
 + alloc: add repository argument to alloc_blob_node
 + object: add repository argument to grow_object_hash
 + object: add repository argument to create_object
 + repository: introduce parsed objects field
 (this branch is used by sb/object-store-grafts.)

 The conversion to pass "the_repository" and then "a_repository"
 throughout the object access API continues.


* sb/plug-misc-leaks (2018-06-04) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-06-13 at bf68cabe28)
 + SQUASH: tentatively cast const-ness away when calling free()
 + sequencer.c: plug mem leak in git_sequencer_config
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-06-04 at fbefac1c7a)
 + sequencer.c: plug leaks in do_pick_commit
 + submodule--helper: plug mem leak in print_default_remote
 + refs/packed-backend.c: close fd of empty file

 Misc leak plugging.


* sg/update-ref-stdin-cleanup (2018-06-04) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-06-13 at 2b9924760d)
 + update-ref --stdin: use skip_prefix()

 Code cleanup.

 - json_writer: new routines to create JSON data

 Preparatory code to later add json output for unspecified telemetry
 data.

 We do not add random code that does not have real users to our

 before too long.


* hn/bisect-first-parent (2018-04-21) 1 commit
 - bisect: create 'bisect_flags' parameter in find_bisection()

 Preliminary code update to allow passing more flags down the

* mk/http-backend-content-length (2018-06-11) 3 commits
 - http-backend: respect CONTENT_LENGTH for receive-pack
 - http-backend: respect CONTENT_LENGTH as specified by rfc3875
 - http-backend: cleanup writing to child process

 The http-backend (used for smart-http transport) used to slurp the
 whole input until EOF, without paying attention to CONTENT_LENGTH
 that is supplied in the environment and instead expecting the Web
 server to close the input stream.  This has been fixed.

 Expecting a reroll.


* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2017-08-10) 1 commit
 . zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

 Needs resurrecting by making sure the fix is good and still applies
 (or adjusted to today's codebase).

* sb/fix-fetching-moved-submodules (2018-06-14) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-06-22 at 16039dc62a)
 + t5526: test recursive submodules when fetching moved submodules
 + submodule: fix NULL correctness in renamed broken submodules

 The code to try seeing if a fetch is necessary in a submodule
 during a fetch with --recurse-submodules got confused when the path
 to the submodule was changed in the range of commits in the
 superproject, sometimes showing "(null)".  This has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* sb/submodule-core-worktree (2018-06-19) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-06-22 at 2f7f263b30)
 + submodule deinit: unset core.worktree
 + submodule: ensure core.worktree is set after update
 + submodule: unset core.worktree if no working tree is present

 "git submodule" did not correctly adjust core.worktree setting that
 indicates whether/where a submodule repository has its associated
 working tree across various state transitions, which has been
 corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 The recent addition of "partial clone" experimental feature kicked
 in when it shouldn't, namely, when there is no partial-clone filter

 determine whom to sign the push certificate as, which has been
 corrected.

 + add -p: fix counting empty context lines in edited patches

 When user edits the patch in "git add -p" and the user's editor is
 set to strip trailing whitespaces indiscriminately, an empty line
 that is unchanged in the patch would become completely empty
 (instead of a line with a sole SP on it).  The code introduced in
 Git 2.17 timeframe failed to parse such a patch, but now it learned
 to notice the situation and cope with it.

 + completion: collapse extra --no-.. options
 + completion: suppress some -no- options
 + parse-options: option to let --git-completion-helper show negative form

 Continuing with the idea to programatically enumerate various
 pieces of data required for command line completion, the codebase
 has been taught to enumerate options prefixed with "--no-" to
 negate them.

 - mem-pool: add lifecycle management functions
 - mem-pool: tweak math on mp_block allocation size

 - block alloc: add lifecycle APIs for cache_entry structs
 - read-cache: teach refresh_cache_entry() to take istate

 For a large tree, the index needs to hold many cache entries
 allocated on heap.  These cache entries are now allocated out of a
 dedicated memory pool to amortize malloc(3) overhead.

 Kicked back to 'pu' with a rerolled one.

* jk/branch-l-0-deprecation (2018-06-22) 3 commits
 - branch: deprecate "-l" option
 - t: switch "branch -l" to "branch --create-reflog"
 - t3200: unset core.logallrefupdates when testing reflog creation
 (this branch is used by jk/branch-l-1-repurpose.)

 The "-l" option in "git branch -l" is an unfortunate short-hand for
 "--create-reflog", but many users, both old and new, somehow expect
 it to be something else, perhaps "--list".  This step warns when "-l"
 is used as a short-hand for "--create-reflog" and warns about the
 future repurposing of the it when it is used.
