What's cooking in git.git (Nov 2019, #01; Mon, 4)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

Git 2.24 has been tagged.  Hopefully there needs no immediate brown
paper bag fixes needed for the 'master' branch. The next cycle will
start perhaps early next week by first rewinding the 'next' branch,
after the dust settles. Topics marked as "will cook in next" can be
given a fresh start by ejecting them from 'next' and queueing a new
version (please just ask). Topics currently not in 'next' will then
start getting merged down after all that.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

[Stalled]

* vn/reset-deleted-ita (2019-07-26) 1 commit

 - index: offer advice for unknown index extensions
 - index: do not warn about unrecognized extensions

 A bit too alarming warning given when unknown index extensions
 exist is getting revamped.

 Expecting a reroll.


* jc/format-patch-delay-message-id (2019-04-05) 1 commit
 - format-patch: move message-id and related headers to the end

 The location "git format-patch --thread" adds the Message-Id:
 header in the series of header fields has been moved down, which
 may help working around a suspected bug in GMail MSA, reported at
 <CAHk-=whP1stFZNAaJiMi5eZ9rj0MRt20Y_yHVczZPH+O01d+sA@mail.gmail.com>

 Waiting for feedback to see if it truly helps.
 Needs tests.


* js/protocol-advertise-multi (2018-12-28) 1 commit
 - protocol: advertise multiple supported versions

 The transport layer has been updated so that the protocol version
 used can be negotiated between the parties, by the initiator
 listing the protocol versions it is willing to talk, and the other
 side choosing from one of them.

 Expecting a reroll.

* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2018-10-15) 1 commit

 updated to use "size_t".

--------------------------------------------------

 "git rebase -i" learned a few options that are known by "git
 rebase" proper.

  (merged to 'next' on 2019-10-30 at 8405cac984)

 "git stash save" in a working tree that is sparsely checked out
 mistakenly removed paths that are outside the area of interest.

  (merged to 'next' on 2019-10-30 at 06f719efa5)
 + pretty: add "%aL" etc. to show local-part of email addresses
 + t4203: use test-lib.sh definitions
 + t6006: use test-lib.sh definitions

 The custom format for "git log --format=<format>" learned the l/L
 placeholder that is similar to e/E that fills in the e-mail
 address, but only the local part on the left side of '@'.

 Will cook in 'next'.

  (merged to 'next' on 2019-10-28 at 13d01506dd)

 around.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ma/bisect-doc-sample-update (2019-10-29) 1 commit
 - Documentation/git-bisect.txt: add --no-ff to merge command

 "git merge --no-commit" needs "--no-ff" if you do not want to move
 HEAD, which has been corrected in the manual page for "git bisect".

 Will merge to 'next'.


* mr/clone-dir-exists-to-path-exists (2019-10-29) 1 commit
 - clone: rename static function `dir_exists()`.

* pb/no-recursive-reset-hard-in-worktree-add (2019-10-30) 1 commit
 - worktree: teach "add" to ignore submodule.recurse config

 "git worktree add" internally calls "reset --hard" that should not
 descend into submodules, even when submodule.recurse configuration
 is set, but it was affected.  This has been correct.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sg/blame-indent-heuristics-is-now-the-default (2019-10-29) 1 commit
 - builtin/blame.c: remove '--indent-heuristic' from usage string

 Message update.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* jk/cleanup-object-parsing-and-fsck (2019-10-28) 23 commits

 + fsck: stop checking tag->tagged
 + fsck: stop checking commit->parent counts
 + fsck: stop checking commit->tree value
 + commit, tag: don't set parsed bit for parse failures
 + parse_tag_buffer(): treat NULL tag pointer as parse error
 + parse_commit_buffer(): treat lookup_tree() failure as parse error
 + parse_commit_buffer(): treat lookup_commit() failure as parse error

 Crufty code and logic accumulated over time around the object
 parsing and low-level object access used in "git fsck" have been
 cleaned up.

  (merged to 'next' on 2019-10-24 at 82fa49bbf2)

 - Doc: Bundle file usage

 Doc update.

 Expecting a reroll.

 Doc update.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* js/advise-rebase-skip (2019-10-23) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-10-24 at e2edd2df2d)
 + commit: give correct advice for empty commit during a rebase
 + sequencer: export the function to get the path of `.git/rebase-merge/`
 + cherry-pick: add test for `--skip` advice in `git commit`

 The logic used in "git commit" to give hints and errors depending
 on what operation was in progress learned to distinguish rebase and
 cherry-pick better.

 Will cook in 'next'.
 cf. <9d550cd9-08a2-eee5-7d7f-63678285accc@gmail.com>

 + notes: fix minimum number of parameters to "copy" subcommand
 + t3301: test diagnose messages for too few/many paramters

 "git notes copy $original" ought to copy the notes attached to the
 original object to HEAD, but a mistaken tightening to command line
 parameter validation made earlier disabled that feature by mistake.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* jc/log-graph-simplify (2019-10-16) 13 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-10-24 at 190b88709e)
 + graph: fix coloring of octopus dashes

 Will cook in 'next'.

 - git_path(): handle `.lock` files correctly
 - t1400: wrap setup code in test case

 "git rev-parse --git-path HEAD.lock" did not give the right path
 when run in a secondary worktree.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 update, which has been corrected.

 Will cook in 'next'.

* dl/format-patch-cover-from-desc (2019-10-16) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-10-18 at 40e992b6f5)
 + format-patch: teach --cover-from-description option
 + format-patch: use enum variables
 + format-patch: replace erroneous and condition

 The branch description ("git branch --edit-description") has been
 used to fill the body of the cover letters by the format-patch
 command; this has been enhanced so that the subject can also be
 filled.

 Will cook in 'next'.
 No need for rush, as this is a new feature.

 + merge-recursive: fix merging a subdirectory into the root directory
 + merge-recursive: clean up get_renamed_dir_portion()

 When all files from some subdirectory were renamed to the root
 directory, the directory rename heuristics would fail to detect that
 as a rename/merge of the subdirectory to the root directory, which has
 been corrected.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* jt/fetch-pack-record-refs-in-the-dot-promisor (2019-10-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-10-18 at 4ead52e59a)

* mt/threaded-grep-in-object-store (2019-10-02) 11 commits
 - grep: move driver pre-load out of critical section
 - grep: re-enable threads in non-worktree case

 - grep: fix race conditions on userdiff calls

 Traditionally, we avoided threaded grep while searching in objects
 (as opposed to files in the working tree) as accesses to the object
 layer is not thread-safe.  This limitation is getting lifted.

 - builtin/pack-objects: introduce obj_is_packed()

 + builtin/pack-objects: report reused packfile objects

 The way "git pack-objects" reuses objects stored in existing pack
 to generate its result has been improved.


* js/builtin-add-i (2019-08-30) 11 commits
 . built-in add -i: implement the `help` command
 . built-in add -i: use color in the main loop
 . built-in add -i: support `?` (prompt help)

 The beginning of rewriting "git add -i" in C.

 Expecting a reroll on top of a base with the tg/stash-refresh-index
 topic that defines an updated repo_refresh_and_write_index() helper.
