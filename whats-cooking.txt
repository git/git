What's cooking in git.git (Mar 2016, #05; Fri, 25)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

Three more minor fix-up topics are to be merged by 2.8 final, but we
are almost there.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* ak/use-hashmap-iter-first-in-submodule-config (2016-03-23) 1 commit
 - submodule-config: use hashmap_iter_first()

 Minor code cleanup.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ky/branch-d-worktree (2016-03-25) 1 commit
 - branch -d: refuse deleting a branch which is currently checked out

 When "git worktree" feature is in use, "git branch -d" allowed
 deletion of a branch that is checked out in another worktree

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ky/branch-m-worktree (2016-03-25) 4 commits
 - branch -m: update all per-worktree HEADs
 - refs: add create_symref_common_dir as a variation of create_symref
 - refs: add REF_COMMON_DIR flag
 - refs: add new flag RESOLVE_REF_COMMON_DIR to resolve_ref_unsafe

 When "git worktree" feature is in use, "git branch -m" renamed a
 branch that is checked out in another worktree without adjusting
 the HEAD symbolic ref for the worktree.

 Needs review.


* nd/apply-doc (2016-03-24) 2 commits
 - git-apply.txt: mention the behavior inside a subdir
 - git-apply.txt: remove a space

 Will merge to 'next'.


* nd/apply-report-skip (2016-03-24) 1 commit
 - apply: report patch skipping in verbose mode

 "git apply -v" learned to report paths in the patch that were
 skipped via --include/--exclude mechanism or being outside the
 current working directory.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* pb/opt-cmdmode-doc (2016-03-25) 1 commit
 - api-parse-options.txt: document OPT_CMDMODE()

 Minor API documentation update.

 - completion: add 'revisions' and 'everyday' to 'git help'
 - completion: add option '--guides' to 'git help'

 Shell completion (in contrib/) updates.


* rt/rebase-i-shorten-stop-report (2016-03-24) 1 commit
 - rebase-i: print abbreviated hash when stop for editing

 The commit object name reported when "rebase -i" stops has been
 shortened.

 Needs a better explanation.


* sb/submodule-helper-prefix (2016-03-25) 5 commits
 - submodule--helper clone: lose the extra prefix option
 - submodule sync: test syncing one submodule
 - submodule update: add test for recursive from non root dir

[Graduated to "master"]

* js/mingw-tests-2.8 (2016-03-23) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-03-23 at aeec80e)
 + mingw: skip some tests in t9115 due to file name issues
 + t1300: fix the new --show-origin tests on Windows
 + t1300-repo-config: make it resilient to being run via 'sh -x'
 + config --show-origin: report paths with forward slashes

 Last-minute tweaks to test to pass on Windows.

  (merged to 'next' on 2016-03-23 at 94a6275)
 + Documentation: fix git-p4 AsciiDoc formatting
 + Documentation: use ASCII quotation marks in git-p4

 Trivially OK doc cleanup.


* sb/submodule-module-list-pathspec-fix (2016-03-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-03-23 at 67fe17c)
 + submodule: fix regression for deinit without submodules

 A fix to a small regression in module_list helper that was
 rewritten in C in 2.7.x timeframe.


--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* ec/annotate-deleted (2015-11-20) 1 commit
 - annotate: skip checking working tree if a revision is provided

 Usability fix for annotate-specific "<file> <rev>" syntax with deleted
 files.

 Waiting for review.


* dg/subtree-rebase-test (2016-01-19) 1 commit
 - contrib/subtree: Add a test for subtree rebase that loses commits

 Reviewed up to v5.
 Will be rerolled.
 ($gmane/284426)


* js/am-3-merge-recursive-direct (2015-10-12) 2 commits
 - am: make a direct call to merge_recursive
 - merge_recursive_options: introduce the "gently" flag

 The merge_recursive_generic() function has been made a bit safer to
 call from inside a process.  "git am -3" was taught to make a direct
 call to the function when falling back to three-way merge.

 Being able to make a direct call would be good in general, but as a
 performance thing, the change needs to be backed up by numbers.

 Needs review.

 I haven't gone through the "gently" change with fine toothed comb;
 I can see that the change avoids calling die(), but I haven't made
 sure that the program states (e.g. what's in the in-core index) are
 adjusted sensibly when it returns to the caller instead of dying,
 or the codepaths that used to die() are free of resource leaks.
 The original code certainly did not care the program states at the
 point of dying exactly because it knew it is going to exit, but now
 they have to care, and they need to be audited.


* dk/gc-more-wo-pack (2016-01-13) 4 commits
 - gc: clean garbage .bitmap files from pack dir
 - t5304: ensure non-garbage files are not deleted
 - t5304: test .bitmap garbage files
 - prepare_packed_git(): find more garbage

 Follow-on to dk/gc-idx-wo-pack topic, to clean up stale
 .bitmap and .keep files.

 Waiting for a reroll.
 ($gmane/284368).


* jc/diff-b-m (2015-02-23) 5 commits
 . WIPWIP
 . WIP: diff-b-m
 - diffcore-rename: allow easier debugging
 - diffcore-rename.c: add locate_rename_src()
 - diffcore-break: allow debugging

 "git diff -B -M" produced incorrect patch when the postimage of a
 completely rewritten file is similar to the preimage of a removed
 file; such a resulting file must not be expressed as a rename from
 other place.

 The fix in this patch is broken, unfortunately.
 Will discard.

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* jk/check-repository-format (2016-03-11) 10 commits
 - verify_repository_format: mark messages for translation
 - setup: drop repository_format_version global
 - setup: unify repository version callbacks
 - init: use setup.c's repo version verification
 - setup: refactor repo format reading and verification
 - config: drop git_config_early
 - check_repository_format_gently: stop using git_config_early
 - lazily load core.sharedrepository
 - wrap shared_repository global in get/set accessors
 - setup: document check_repository_format()

 The repository set-up sequence has been streamlined (the biggest
 change is that there is no longer git_config_early()), so that we
 do not attempt to look into refs/* when we know we do not have a
 Git repository.


* mj/pull-rebase-autostash (2016-03-21) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-03-23 at ebf1afa)
 + pull --rebase: add --[no-]autostash flag
 + git-pull.c: introduce git_pull_config()

 "git pull --rebase" learned "--[no-]autostash" option, so that
 the rebase.autostash configuration variable set to true can be
 overridden from the command line.

 Will merge to 'master' after 2.8 final.


* pb/commit-verbose-config (2016-03-14) 1 commit
 - commit: add a commit.verbose config variable
 (this branch uses pb/t7502-drop-dup.)

 "git commit" learned to pay attention to "commit.verbose"
 configuration variable and act as if "--verbose" option was given
 from the command line.


* pb/t7502-drop-dup (2016-03-11) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-03-15 at 037c877)
 + t/t7502 : drop duplicate test
 (this branch is used by pb/commit-verbose-config.)

 Code clean-up.

 Will merge to 'master' after 2.8 final.


* ss/commit-squash-msg (2016-03-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-03-23 at 0b72631)
 + commit: do not lose SQUASH_MSG contents

 When "git merge --squash" stopped due to conflict, the concluding
 "git commit" failed to read in the SQUASH_MSG that shows the log
 messages from all the squashed commits.

 Will merge to 'master' after 2.8 final.


* ls/p4-map-user (2016-03-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-03-23 at 9e0a4f5)
 + git-p4: map a P4 user to Git author name and email address

 Will merge to 'master' after 2.8 final.


* jc/merge-refuse-new-root (2016-03-23) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-03-23 at d7da4cf)
 + merge: refuse to create too cool a merge by default

 "git merge" used to allow merging two branches that have no common
 base by default, which led to a brand new history of an existing
 project created and then get pulled by an unsuspecting maintainer,
 which allowed an unnecessary parallel history merged into the
 existing project.  The command has been taught not to allow this by
 default, with an escape hatch "--allow-unrelated-histories" option
 to be used in a rare event that merges histories of two projects
 that started their lives independently.

 Will merge to 'master' after 2.8 final.


* jc/rerere-multi-wip (2016-03-21) 1 commit
 . WIP forget
 (this branch uses jc/rerere-multi.)

 + t/lib-httpd: pass through GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM env

 Will merge to 'master' after 2.8 final.


* lt/pretty-expand-tabs (2016-03-23) 5 commits
 - pretty-print: teach "--no-expand-tabs" option to "git log"
 - pretty-print: limit expand-tabs to selected --pretty formats
 - pretty-print: further abstract out pp_handle_indent()
 - pretty-print: simplify the interaction between pp_handle_indent() and its caller
 - pretty-print: de-tabify indented logs to make things line up properly

 May need a UI rework.
 Needs reordering.


* sb/clone-shallow-passthru (2016-03-23) 3 commits
 - clone: add t5614 to test cloning submodules with shallowness involved
 - submodule clone: pass along `local` option
 - clone: add `--shallow-submodules` flag
 (this branch uses sb/submodule-parallel-update; is tangled with sb/submodule-init.)

 "git clone" learned "--shallow-submodules" option.

 Needs review.


* sb/clone-t57-t56 (2016-03-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-03-23 at 5df850d)
 + clone tests: rename t57* => t56*

 Rename bunch of tests on "git clone" for better organization.

 Will merge to 'master' after 2.8 final.

 "git rebase -x" can be used without passing "-i" option.

 Will merge to 'master' after 2.8 final.

 - index-helper: add --strict
 - index-helper: new daemon for caching index and related stuff
 - read-cache: allow to keep mmap'd memory after reading
 - read-cache.c: fix constness of verify_hdr()


* jv/merge-nothing-into-void (2016-03-23) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-03-23 at 40b905d)
 + merge: fix NULL pointer dereference when merging nothing into void

 "git merge FETCH_HEAD" dereferenced NULL pointer when merging
 nothing into an unborn history (which is arguably unusual usage,
 which perhaps was the reason why nobody noticed it).

 Will merge to 'master' after 2.8 final.


* la/tag-force-signing-annotated-tags (2016-03-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-03-24 at 424da3f)
 + tag: add the option to force signing of annotated tags

 "git tag" can create an annotated tag without explicitly given an
 "-a" (or "-s") option (i.e. when a tag message is given).  A new
 configuration variable, tag.forceSignAnnotated, can be used to tell
 the command to create signed tag in such a situation.

 Will merge to 'master' after 2.8 final.


* cc/doc-recommend-performance-trace-to-file (2016-03-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-03-23 at 086b9f2)
 + Documentation: talk about pager in api-trace.txt

 Will merge to 'master' after 2.8 final.


* da/mergetool-delete-delete-conflict (2016-03-10) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-03-15 at 281a81a)
 + mergetool: honor tempfile configuration when resolving delete conflicts
 + mergetool: support delete/delete conflicts

 "git mergetool" did not work well with conflicts that both sides
 deleted.

 Will merge to 'master' after 2.8 final.


* es/test-gpg-tags (2016-03-06) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-03-15 at 617119f)
 + t6302: skip only signed tags rather than all tests when GPG is missing
 + t6302: also test annotated in addition to signed tags
 + t6302: normalize names and descriptions of signed tags
 + lib-gpg: drop unnecessary "missing GPG" warning

 A test for tags has been restructured so that more parts of it can
 easily be run on a platform without a working GnuPG.

 Will merge to 'master' after 2.8 final.


* jk/getwholeline-getdelim-empty (2016-03-05) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-03-15 at e70d4bd)
 + strbuf_getwholeline: NUL-terminate getdelim buffer on error

 strbuf_getwholeline() did not NUL-terminate the buffer on certain
 corner cases in its error codepath.

 Will merge to 'master' after 2.8 final.


* jk/startup-info (2016-03-07) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-03-15 at eb95e5f)
 + use setup_git_directory() in test-* programs
 + grep: turn off gitlink detection for --no-index
 + mailmap: do not resolve blobs in a non-repository
 + remote: don't resolve HEAD in non-repository
 + setup: set startup_info->have_repository more reliably
 + setup: make startup_info available everywhere

 The startup_info data, which records if we are working inside a
 repository (among other things), are now uniformly available to Git
 subcommand implementations, and Git avoids attempting to touch
 references when we are not in a repository.

 Will merge to 'master' after 2.8 final.


* rj/xdiff-prepare-plug-leak-on-error-codepath (2016-03-04) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-03-15 at f72755e)
 + xdiff/xprepare: fix a memory leak
 + xdiff/xprepare: use the XDF_DIFF_ALG() macro to access flag bits

 A small memory leak in an error codepath has been plugged in xdiff
 code.

 Will merge to 'master' after 2.8 final.


* jc/index-pack (2016-03-03) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-03-15 at 42efaa7)
 + index-pack: add a helper function to derive .idx/.keep filename
 + Merge branch 'jc/maint-index-pack-keep' into jc/index-pack
 (this branch is used by jc/bundle; uses jc/maint-index-pack-keep; is tangled with jc/index-pack-clone-bundle.)

 Code clean-up.

 Will merge to 'master' after 2.8 final.


* jc/maint-index-pack-keep (2016-03-03) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-03-04 at bc1d37a)
 + index-pack: correct --keep[=<msg>]
 (this branch is used by jc/bundle, jc/index-pack and jc/index-pack-clone-bundle.)

 "git index-pack --keep[=<msg>] pack-$name.pack" simply did not work.

 Will merge to 'master' after 2.8 final.


* mm/readme-markdown (2016-02-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-03-01 at 81f3858)
 + README.md: don't take 'commandname' literally

 The top-level README file has been updated to be more appropriate
 for the sign on the front door to welcome new acquaintances to Git
 by toning down inside jokes and making it into MarkDown.

 Will merge to 'master' after 2.8 final.


* gf/fetch-pack-direct-object-fetch (2016-03-05) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-03-06 at 5628860)
 + fetch-pack: update the documentation for "<refs>..." arguments
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-03-04 at 49199e0)
 + fetch-pack: fix object_id of exact sha1

 Fetching of history by naming a commit object name directly didn't
 work across remote-curl transport.

 Will merge to 'master' after 2.8 final.


* jk/add-i-highlight (2016-02-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-03-04 at 4ac3aa1)

* jk/config-get-urlmatch (2016-02-28) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-03-04 at feeb192)
 + Documentation/git-config: fix --get-all description
 + Documentation/git-config: use bulleted list for exit codes
 + config: fail if --get-urlmatch finds no value

 "git config --get-urlmatch", unlike other variants of the "git
 config --get" family, did not signal error with its exit status
 when there was no matching configuration.

 Will merge to 'master' after 2.8 final.


* jk/rev-parse-local-env-vars (2016-02-29) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-03-04 at a0300d5)
 + rev-parse: let some options run outside repository
 + t1515: add tests for rev-parse out-of-repo helpers

 The "--local-env-vars" and "--resolve-git-dir" options of "git
 rev-parse" failed to work outside a repository when the command's
 option parsing was rewritten in 1.8.5 era.

 Will merge to 'master' after 2.8 final.

 - bundle v3: the beginning
 - bundle: keep a copy of bundle file name in the in-core bundle header
 - bundle: plug resource leak

  (merged to 'next' on 2016-03-04 at f7b26b7)
 + credential: let empty credential specs reset helper list

 The credential.helper configuration variable is cumulative and
 there is no good way to override it from the command line.  As
 a special case, giving an empty string as its value now serves
 as the signal to clear the values specified in various files.

* nd/shallow-deepen (2016-02-23) 25 commits
 - fetch, upload-pack: --deepen=N extends shallow boundary by N commits
 - upload-pack: add get_reachable_list()
 - upload-pack: split check_unreachable() in two, prep for get_reachable_list()
 - t5500, t5539: tests for shallow depth excluding a ref
 - clone: define shallow clone boundary with --shallow-exclude
 - fetch: define shallow boundary with --shallow-exclude
 - upload-pack: support define shallow boundary by excluding revisions
 - refs: add expand_ref()
 - t5500, t5539: tests for shallow depth since a specific date
 - clone: define shallow clone boundary based on time with --shallow-since
 - fetch: define shallow boundary with --shallow-since
 - upload-pack: add deepen-since to cut shallow repos based on time
 - shallow.c: implement a generic shallow boundary finder based on rev-list
 - fetch-pack: use a separate flag for fetch in deepening mode
 - fetch-pack: use a common function for verbose printing
 - fetch-pack: use skip_prefix() instead of starts_with()
 - upload-pack: move rev-list code out of check_non_tip()
 - upload-pack: tighten number parsing at "deepen" lines
 - upload-pack: use skip_prefix() instead of starts_with()
 - upload-pack: move "unshallow" sending code out of deepen()
 - upload-pack: remove unused variable "backup"
 - upload-pack: move "shallow" sending code out of deepen()
 - upload-pack: move shallow deepen code out of receive_needs()
 - transport-helper.c: refactor set_helper_option()
 - remote-curl.c: convert fetch_git() to use argv_array

 The existing "git fetch --depth=<n>" option was hard to use
 correctly when making the history of an existing shallow clone
 deeper.  A new option, "--deepen=<n>", has been added to make this
 easier to use.  "git clone" also learned "--shallow-since=<date>"
 and "--shallow-exclude=<tag>" options to make it easier to specify
 "I am interested only in the recent N months worth of history" and
 "Give me only the history since that version".

 Needs review.


* mm/diff-renames-default (2016-02-25) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-02-25 at 947c399)
 + diff: activate diff.renames by default
 + log: introduce init_log_defaults()
 + t: add tests for diff.renames (true/false/unset)
 + t4001-diff-rename: wrap file creations in a test
 + Documentation/diff-config: fix description of diff.renames

 The end-user facing Porcelain level commands like "diff" and "log"
 now enables the rename detection by default.

 Will merge to 'master' after 2.8 final.


* mp/upload-pack-use-embedded-args (2016-02-25) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-02-26 at f0a54e5)
 + upload-pack: use argv_array for pack_objects

 The embedded args argv-array in the child process is used to build
 the command line to run pack-objects instead of using a separate
 array of strings.

 Will merge to 'master' after 2.8 final.


* sb/submodule-init (2016-03-15) 2 commits
 - submodule: port init from shell to C
 - submodule: port resolve_relative_url from shell to C
 (this branch uses sb/submodule-parallel-update; is tangled with sb/clone-shallow-passthru.)

 Update of "git submodule" to move pieces of logic to C continues.

 Needs review.

* az/p4-bare-no-rebase (2016-02-19) 1 commit
 - git-p4.py: Don't try to rebase on submit from bare repository

 "git p4 submit" attempts to do a rebase, which would fail if done
 in a bare repository.  Not doing this rebase would paper over the
 failure, which is what this patch does, but it is unclear what the
 side effect of not rebasing is.

 Needs a better explanation.


* ss/commit-dry-run-resolve-merge-to-no-op (2016-02-17) 1 commit
 - wt-status.c: set commitable bit if there is a meaningful merge.

 "git commit --dry-run" reported "No, no, you cannot commit." in one
 case where "git commit" would have allowed you to commit, and this
 improves it a little bit ("git commit --dry-run --short" still does
 not give you the correct answer, for example).


* nd/icase (2016-02-15) 12 commits
 - grep.c: reuse "icase" variable
 - diffcore-pickaxe: support case insensitive match on non-ascii
 - diffcore-pickaxe: "share" regex error handling code
 - grep/pcre: support utf-8
 - gettext: add is_utf8_locale()
 - grep/pcre: prepare locale-dependent tables for icase matching
 - grep/icase: avoid kwsset when -F is specified
 - grep/icase: avoid kwsset on literal non-ascii strings
 - test-regex: expose full regcomp() to the command line
 - test-regex: isolate the bug test code
 - grep: break down an "if" stmt in preparation for next changes
 - grep: allow -F -i combination

 "git grep -i" has been taught to fold case in non-ascii locales.

 Needs review.

* sb/submodule-parallel-update (2016-03-01) 10 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-03-15 at a8bf6c5)
 + clone: allow an explicit argument for parallel submodule clones
 + submodule update: expose parallelism to the user
 + submodule helper: remove double 'fatal: ' prefix
 + git submodule update: have a dedicated helper for cloning
 + run_processes_parallel: rename parameters for the callbacks
 + run_processes_parallel: treat output of children as byte array
 + submodule update: direct error message to stderr
 + fetching submodules: respect `submodule.fetchJobs` config option
 + submodule-config: drop check against NULL
 + submodule-config: keep update strategy around
 (this branch is used by sb/clone-shallow-passthru and sb/submodule-init.)

 A major part of "git submodule update" has been ported to C to take
 advantage of the recently added framework to run download tasks in
 parallel.

 Will merge to 'master' after 2.8 final.

* jc/rerere-multi (2016-03-15) 10 commits
 - rerere: split code to call ll_merge() further
 - rerere: move code related to "forget" together
 - rerere: gc and clear
 - rerere: do use multiple variants
 - t4200: rerere a merge with two identical conflicts
 - rerere: allow multiple variants to exist
 - rerere: delay the recording of preimage

 - rerere: scan $GIT_DIR/rr-cache/$ID when instantiating a rerere_id
 - rerere: split conflict ID further
 (this branch is used by jc/rerere-multi-wip.)

 "git rerere" can encounter two or more files with the same conflict
 signature that have to be resolved in different ways, but there was
 no way to record these separate resolutions.

 May need further work on forget.


* jc/merge-drop-old-syntax (2015-04-29) 1 commit
 - merge: drop 'git merge <message> HEAD <commit>' syntax

 Stop supporting "git merge <message> HEAD <commit>" syntax that has
 been deprecated since October 2007.  It has been reported that
 git-gui still uses the deprecated syntax, which needs to be fixed
 before this final step can proceed.
