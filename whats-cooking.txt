What's cooking in git.git (Mar 2020, #09; Sun, 29)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

The first batch of topics after v2.26 are now in 'master'.  I plan
to rewind and rebuild 'next' after merging another batch.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

[Graduated to "master"]

* ah/force-pull-rebase-configuration (2020-03-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-03-11 at c79dbbaf9c)
 + pull: warn if the user didn't say whether to rebase or to merge

 "git pull" learned to warn when no pull.rebase configuration
 exists, and neither --[no-]rebase nor --ff-only is given (which
 would result a merge).


* at/rebase-fork-point-regression-fix (2020-02-11) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-03-02 at a1a84d37a7)
 + rebase: --fork-point regression fix

 The "--fork-point" mode of "git rebase" regressed when the command
 was rewritten in C back in 2.20 era, which has been corrected.


* bc/filter-process (2020-03-16) 8 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-03-17 at 2cd9dbf794)
 + t0021: test filter metadata for additional cases
 + builtin/reset: compute checkout metadata for reset
 + builtin/rebase: compute checkout metadata for rebases
 + builtin/clone: compute checkout metadata for clones
 + builtin/checkout: compute checkout metadata for checkouts
 + convert: provide additional metadata to filters
 + convert: permit passing additional metadata to filter processes
 + builtin/checkout: pass branch info down to checkout_worktree

 Provide more information (e.g. the object of the tree-ish in which
 the blob being converted appears, in addition to its path, which
 has already been given) to smudge/clean conversion filters.


* bc/sha-256-part-1-of-4 (2020-02-28) 22 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-03-17 at 436c4e64a7)
 + fast-import: add options for rewriting submodules
 + fast-import: add a generic function to iterate over marks
 + fast-import: make find_marks work on any mark set
 + fast-import: add helper function for inserting mark object entries
 + fast-import: permit reading multiple marks files
 + commit: use expected signature header for SHA-256
 + worktree: allow repository version 1
 + init-db: move writing repo version into a function
 + builtin/init-db: add environment variable for new repo hash
 + builtin/init-db: allow specifying hash algorithm on command line
 + setup: allow check_repository_format to read repository format
 + t/helper: make repository tests hash independent
 + t/helper: initialize repository if necessary
 + t/helper/test-dump-split-index: initialize git repository
 + t6300: make hash algorithm independent
 + t6300: abstract away SHA-1-specific constants
 + t: use hash-specific lookup tables to define test constants
 + repository: require a build flag to use SHA-256
 + hex: add functions to parse hex object IDs in any algorithm
 + hex: introduce parsing variants taking hash algorithms
 + hash: implement and use a context cloning function
 + builtin/pack-objects: make hash agnostic

 SHA-256 transition continues.


* ds/default-pack-use-sparse-to-true (2020-03-20) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-03-21 at 25cc87784d)
 + pack-objects: flip the use of GIT_TEST_PACK_SPARSE
 + config: set pack.useSparse=true by default

 The 'pack.useSparse' configuration variable now defaults to 'true',
 enabling an optimization that has been experimental since Git 2.21.


* hi/gpg-prefer-check-signature (2020-03-15) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-03-17 at 2def2d9a7e)
 + gpg-interface: prefer check_signature() for GPG verification
 + t: increase test coverage of signature verification output

 The code to interface with GnuPG has been refactored.


* jc/describe-misnamed-annotated-tag (2020-02-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-03-02 at b4e2ca6a46)
 + describe: force long format for a name based on a mislocated tag

 When "git describe C" finds an annotated tag with tagname A to be
 the best name to explain commit C, and the tag is stored in a
 "wrong" place in the refs/tags hierarchy, e.g. refs/tags/B, the
 command gave a warning message but used A (not B) to describe C.
 If C is exactly at the tag, the describe output would be "A", but
 "git rev-parse A^0" would not be equal as "git rev-parse C^0".  The
 behavior of the command has been changed to use the "long" form
 i.e. A-0-gOBJECTNAME, which is correctly interpreted by rev-parse.


* pb/recurse-submodules-fix (2020-02-19) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-03-17 at b46922ddd1)
 + t/lib-submodule-update: add test removing nested submodules
 + unpack-trees: check for missing submodule directory in merged_entry
 + unpack-trees: remove outdated description for verify_clean_submodule
 + t/lib-submodule-update: move a test to the right section
 + t/lib-submodule-update: remove outdated test description
 + t7112: remove mention of KNOWN_FAILURE_SUBMODULE_RECURSIVE_NESTED

 Fix "git checkout --recurse-submodules" of a nested submodule
 hierarchy.


* tg/retire-scripted-stash (2020-03-05) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-03-05 at 8e82eb9dec)
 + stash: remove the stash.useBuiltin setting
 + stash: get git_stash_config at the top level

 "git stash" has kept an escape hatch to use the scripted version
 for a few releases, which got stale.  It has been removed.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* dr/midx-avoid-int-underflow (2020-03-28) 1 commit
 - midx.c: fix an integer underflow

 When fed a midx that records no objects, some codepaths tried to
 loop from 0 through (num_objects-1), which, due to integer
 arithmetic wrapping around, made it nonsense operation with out of
 bounds array accesses.  The code has been corrected to reject such
 an midx file.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ak/run-command-on-cygwin-fix (2020-03-27) 1 commit
 - run-command: trigger PATH lookup properly on Cygwin

 Utitiles run via the run_command() API were not spawned correctly
 on Cygwin, when the paths to them are given as a full path with
 backslashes.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* dd/ci-musl-libc (2020-03-29) 3 commits
 - travis: build and test on Linux with musl libc and busybox
 - ci: refactor docker runner script
 - ci: libify logic for usage and checking CI_USER

 A new CI job to build and run test suite on linux with musl libc
 has been added.


* dr/doc-recurse-submodules (2020-03-27) 5 commits
 - doc: --recurse-submodules mostly applies to active submodules
 - doc: be more precise on (fetch|push).recurseSubmodules
 - doc: explain how to deactivate submodule.recurse completely
 - doc: document --recurse-submodules for reset and restore
 - doc: list all commands affected by submodule.recurse

 Documentation updates around the "--recurse-submodules" option.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* dr/push-remoteref-fix (2020-03-27) 1 commit
 - remote.c: fix handling of %(push:remoteref)

 The "%(push:remoteref)" placeholder in the "--format=" argument of
 "git format-patch" (and friends) only showed what got explicitly
 configured, not what ref at the receiving end would be updated when
 "git push" was used, as it ignored the default behaviour (e.g. update
 the same ref as the source).

 Expecting a reroll.
 cf. <20200328222546.gvrtzkcazf3bhjno@doriath>


* jc/doc-test-leaving-early (2020-03-29) 1 commit
 - t/README: suggest how to leave test early with failure

 Document the recommended way to abort a failing test early (e.g. by
 exiting a loop), which is to say "return 1".

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/build-with-right-curl (2020-03-27) 2 commits
 - Makefile: use curl-config --cflags
 - Makefile: avoid running curl-config multiple times

 The build procedure did not use the libcurl library and its include
 files correctly for a custom-built installation.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/harden-protocol-v2-delim-handling (2020-03-29) 3 commits
 - test-lib-functions: simplify packetize() stdin code
 - upload-pack: handle unexpected delim packets
 - test-lib-functions: make packetize() more efficient

 The server-end of the v2 protocol to serve "git clone" and "git
 fetch" was not prepared to see a delim packets at unexpected
 places, which led to a crash.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 - update-ref: read commands in a line-wise fashion
 - update-ref: move transaction handling into `update_refs_stdin()`
 - update-ref: pass end pointer instead of strbuf
 - update-ref: drop unused argument for `parse_refname`
 - update-ref: organize commands in an array
 - strbuf: provide function to append whole lines
 - git-update-ref.txt: add missing word
 - refs: fix segfault when aborting empty transaction

 "git update-ref --stdin" learned a handful of new verbs to let the
 user control ref update transactions more explicitly, which helps
 as an ingredient to implement two-phase commit-style atomic
 ref-updates across multiple repositories.

 Good start, but suspect not quite there yet.

* ag/sequencer-i18n-messages (2020-03-28) 1 commit

* en/pull-do-not-rebase-after-fast-forwarding (2020-03-27) 1 commit
 - pull: avoid running both merge and rebase

 "git pull --rebase" tried to run a rebase even after noticing that
 the pull results in a fast-forward and no rebase is needed nor
 sensible, for the past few years due to a mistake nobody noticed.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jc/allow-strlen-substitution-in-shell-scripts (2020-03-29) 1 commit
 - CodingGuidelines: allow ${#posix} == strlen($posix)

 - pull: pass documented fetch options on
 - pull: remove --update-head-ok from documentation

 "git pull" shares many options with underlying "git fetch", but
 some of them were not documented and some of those that would make
 sense to pass down were not passed down.

* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2018-10-15) 1 commit
 - zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use

 . create .git/refs in files-backend.c
 . refs.h: clarify reflog iteration order

 A new refs backend "reftable" to replace the traditional

 Ready for 'next' to be improved/enhanced on top?  As the scope of
 the topic got trimmed, hopefully these early parts can be polished
 quickly enough to be merged down.

[Discarded]

* jc/rebase-backend-keep-old-default (2020-03-10) 1 commit
 . rebase: do not switch the default to 'merge' just yet

 The "merge" backend of "git rebase" still has a few bugs and

 the default.  Let's switch the default back to the "apply" backend
 for now.
