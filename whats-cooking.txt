What's cooking in git.git (Jul 2013, #06; Thu, 18)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.

A handful of code and documentation clean-up patches have been
applied to 'master'.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* bc/commit-invalid-utf8 (2013-07-09) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-07-11 at a2ee572)
 + commit: reject non-characters
 + commit: reject overlong UTF-8 sequences
 + commit: reject invalid UTF-8 codepoints

 Tighten up autodetection of UTF-8 encoded strings.


* bc/push-match-many-refs (2013-07-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-07-11 at df4d56d)
 + remote.c: avoid O(m*n) behavior in match_push_refs

 Pushing to repositories with many refs employed O(m*n) algorithm
 where n is the number of refs on the receiving end.


* bc/send-email-use-port-as-separate-param (2013-07-04) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-07-09 at a569eb5)
 + send-email: provide port separately from hostname

 Pass port number as a separate argument when send-email initializes
 Net::SMTP, instead of as a part of the hostname, i.e. host:port.
 This allows GSSAPI codepath to match with the hostname given.


* bp/mediawiki-preview (2013-07-08) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-07-12 at 870890a)
 + git-remote-mediawiki: add preview subcommand into git mw
 + git-remote-mediawiki: add git-mw command
 + git-remote-mediawiki: factoring code between git-remote-mediawiki and Git::Mediawiki
 + git-remote-mediawiki: update tests to run with the new bin-wrapper
 + git-remote-mediawiki: add a git bin-wrapper for developement
 + wrap-for-bin: make bin-wrappers chainable
 + git-remote-mediawiki: introduction of Git::Mediawiki.pm

 Add a command to allow previewing the contents locally before
 pushing it out, when working with a MediaWiki remote.

 I personally do not think this belongs to Git.  If you are working
 on a set of AsciiDoc source files, you sure do want to locally
 format to preview what you will be pushing out, and if you are
 working on a set of C or Java source files, you do want to test it
 before pushing it out, too.  That kind of thing belongs to your
 build script, not to your SCM.

 But I'll let it pass, as this is only a contrib/ thing.


* cp/submodule-custom-update (2013-07-03) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-07-09 at 3d27516)
 + submodule update: allow custom command to update submodule working tree

 In addition to the choice from "rebase, merge, or checkout-detach",
 allow a custom command to be used in "submodule update" to update
 the working tree of submodules.


* es/overlapping-range-set (2013-07-09) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-07-11 at 3df5a94)
 + range_set: fix coalescing bug when range is a subset of another
 + t4211: fix broken test when one -L range is subset of another


* fg/submodule-clone-depth (2013-07-03) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-07-09 at ab156f3)
 + Add --depth to submodule update/add

 Allow shallow-cloning of submodules with "git submodule update".


* jc/revert-clone-doc-update-for-push-from-shallow (2013-07-15) 1 commit
 + Revert "git-clone.txt: remove the restriction on pushing from a shallow clone"


* jk/fetch-pack-many-refs (2013-07-02) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-07-09 at a53b7c7)
 + fetch-pack: avoid quadratic behavior in rev_list_push
 + commit.c: make compare_commits_by_commit_date global
 + fetch-pack: avoid quadratic list insertion in mark_complete

 Fetching between repositories with many refs employed O(n^2)
 algorithm to match up the common objects, which has been corrected.


* jk/format-patch-from (2013-07-03) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-07-09 at 6ed86d5)
 + teach format-patch to place other authors into in-body "From"
 + pretty.c: drop const-ness from pretty_print_context

 "git format-patch" learned "--from[=whom]" option, which sets the
 "From: " header to the specified person (or the person who runs the
 command, if "=whom" part is missing) and move the original author
 information to an in-body From: header as necessary.


* jk/in-pack-size-measurement (2013-07-12) 10 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-07-12 at 5ba720f)
 + pack-revindex: radix-sort the revindex
 + pack-revindex: use unsigned to store number of objects
 + cat-file: split --batch input lines on whitespace
 + cat-file: add %(objectsize:disk) format atom
 + cat-file: add --batch-check=<format>
 + cat-file: refactor --batch option parsing
 + cat-file: teach --batch to stream blob objects
 + t1006: modernize output comparisons
 + teach sha1_object_info_extended a "disk_size" query
 + zero-initialize object_info structs
 (this branch is used by jk/cat-file-batch-optim.)

 Allow on-disk footprint of objects in packfiles (often they are a
 lot smaller than their true size, when expressed as deltas).


* jk/maint-clone-shared-no-connectivity-validation (2013-07-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-07-11 at 8183412)
 + clone: drop connectivity check for local clones
 (this branch is used by jk/clone-shared-no-connectivity-validation.)

 "git clone -s/-l" is a filesystem level copy and does not offer any
 protection against source repository being corrupt.  While the
 connectivity validation checks commits and trees being readable, it
 made the otherwise instantaneous local modes of clone much more
 expensive, without protecting blob data from bitflips.


* mv/merge-ff-tristate (2013-07-02) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-07-09 at c32b95d)
 + merge: handle --ff/--no-ff/--ff-only as a tri-state option

 The configuration variable "merge.ff" was cleary a tri-state to
 choose one from "favor fast-forward when possible", "always create
 a merge even when the history could fast-forward" and "do not
 create any merge, only update when the history fast-forwards", but
 the command line parser did not implement the usual convention of
 "last one wins, and command line overrides the configuration"
 correctly.


* rr/rebase-reflog-message-reword (2013-06-23) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-07-11 at 59921e0)
 + rebase -i: use a better reflog message
 + rebase: use a better reflog message

 "git rebase [-i]" used to leave just "rebase" as its reflog message
 for some operations. This rewords them to be more informative.


* rs/mailmap-himself (2013-07-17) 1 commit
 + .mailmap: René Scharfe has a new email address


* sb/mailmap-updates (2013-07-17) 3 commits
 + .mailmap: combine more (email, name) to individual persons
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-07-15 at 61c965a)
 + .mailmap: Combine more (email, name) to individual persons
 + .mailmap: Map email addresses to names

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* db/show-ref-head (2013-07-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-07-18 at 73797d0)
 + show-ref: make --head always show the HEAD ref

 The "--head" option to "git show-ref" was only to add "HEAD" to the
 list of candidate refs to be filtered by the usual rules
 (e.g. "--heads" that only show refs under refs/heads).  Change the
 meaning of the option to always show "HEAD" regardless of what
 filtering will be applied to any other ref (this is a backward
 incompatible change, so I may need to add an entry to the Release
 Notes).

 Will merge to 'master'.


* dw/request-pull-diag (2013-07-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-07-18 at d4406de)
 + request-pull: improve error message for invalid revision args

 Will merge to 'master'.


* es/blame-L-breakage (2013-07-17) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-07-18 at cfd871a)
 + blame-options.txt: explain that -L <start> and <end> are optional
 + blame-options.txt: place each -L option variation on its own line
 + t8001/t8002 (blame): add blame -L :funcname tests
 + t8001/t8002 (blame): add blame -L tests
 + t8001/t8002 (blame): modernize style
 + line-range: fix "blame -L X,-N" regression

 The refactoring made for parsing "-L" option recently to support
 "git log -L" seems to have broken "git blame -L X,-5" to show 5
 lines leading to X.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/diff-filter-negation (2013-07-17) 6 commits
 - diff: deprecate -q option to diff-files
 - diff: allow lowercase letter to specify what change class to exclude
 - diff: reject unknown change class given to --diff-filter
 - diff: preparse --diff-filter string argument
 - diff: factor out match_filter()
 - diff: pass the whole diff_options to diffcore_apply_filter()
 (this branch is used by jc/diff-2.0-remove-q-synonym-for-no-deletion.)

 Teach "git diff --diff-filter" to express "I do not want to see
 these classes of changes" more directly by listing only the
 unwanted ones in lowercase (e.g. "--diff-filter=d" will show
 everything but deletion) and deprecate "diff-files -q" which did
 the same thing as "--diff-filter=d".

 Waiting for comments.


* mh/packed-refs-do-one-ref-recursion (2013-07-17) 1 commit
 - do_one_ref(): save and restore value of current_ref

 May want some tests?


* ml/avoid-using-grep-on-crlf-files (2013-07-18) 1 commit
 - test-lib.sh - define and use GREP_STRIPS_CR

 On systems that understand a CRLF as a line ending, tests in this
 script that worked on files with CRLF line endings using "grep" to
 extract matching lines may lose the CR at the end of lines that
 match, causing the actual output not to match the expected output.

 Waiting for success reports from folks on various flavours of
 Windows ports.


* ml/cygwin-updates (2013-07-15) 2 commits
 - Use compat/regex on Cygwin
 - Cygwin has trustable filemode

 This seems to depend heavily on Cygwin version differences.


* mm/diff-no-patch-synonym-to-s (2013-07-17) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-07-18 at 3b893d6)
 + Documentation/git-log.txt: capitalize section names
 + Documentation: move description of -s, --no-patch to diff-options.txt
 + Documentation/git-show.txt: include common diff options, like git-log.txt
 + diff: allow --patch & cie to override -s/--no-patch
 + diff: allow --no-patch as synonym for -s
 + t4000-diff-format.sh: modernize style

 "git show -s" was less discoverable than it should be.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* nd/magic-pathspec (2013-07-17) 47 commits
 - t6131 - skip tests if on case-insensitive file system
 - parse_pathspec: accept :(icase)path syntax
 - pathspec: support :(glob) syntax
 - pathspec: make --literal-pathspecs disable pathspec magic
 - pathspec: support :(literal) syntax for noglob pathspec
 - kill limit_pathspec_to_literal() as it's only used by parse_pathspec()
 - parse_pathspec: preserve prefix length via PATHSPEC_PREFIX_ORIGIN
 - parse_pathspec: make sure the prefix part is wildcard-free
 - rename field "raw" to "_raw" in struct pathspec
 - tree-diff: remove the use of pathspec's raw[] in follow-rename codepath

 - convert {read,fill}_directory to take struct pathspec
 - convert refresh_index to take struct pathspec
 - convert report_path_error to take struct pathspec
 - checkout: convert read_tree_some to take struct pathspec
 - convert unmerge_cache to take struct pathspec
 - convert run_add_interactive to use struct pathspec
 - convert read_cache_preload() to take struct pathspec
 - line-log: convert to use parse_pathspec
 - reset: convert to use parse_pathspec

 - archive: convert to use parse_pathspec
 - ls-files: convert to use parse_pathspec
 - rm: convert to use parse_pathspec
 - checkout: convert to use parse_pathspec
 - rerere: convert to use parse_pathspec
 - status: convert to use parse_pathspec
 - commit: convert to use parse_pathspec
 - clean: convert to use parse_pathspec
 - guard against new pathspec magic in pathspec matching code
 - parse_pathspec: support prefixing original patterns

 - parse_pathspec: support stripping submodule trailing slashes
 - parse_pathspec: add special flag for max_depth feature
 - convert some get_pathspec() calls to parse_pathspec()
 - parse_pathspec: add PATHSPEC_PREFER_{CWD,FULL} flags
 - parse_pathspec: save original pathspec for reporting
 - add parse_pathspec() that converts cmdline args to struct pathspec
 - pathspec: add copy_pathspec
 - pathspec: i18n-ize error strings in pathspec parsing code
 - move struct pathspec and related functions to pathspec.[ch]
 - clean: remove unused variable "seen"

 Use "struct pathspec" interface in more places, instead of array of
 characters, the latter of which cannot express magic pathspecs
 (e.g. ":(icase)makefile" that matches both Makefile and makefile).

 Will merge to 'next'.


* rh/template-updates (2013-07-15) 3 commits
 - templates: spell ASCII in uppercase in pre-commit hook
 - templates: Reformat pre-commit hook's message
 - templates: Use heredoc in pre-commit hook

 This is an earlier part of a 6 patch series, with log message
 corrected.


* sb/misc-fixes (2013-07-15) 3 commits
 - diff.c: Do not initialize a variable, which gets reassigned anyway.
 - commit: Fix a memory leak in determine_author_info
 - daemon.c:handle: Remove unneeded check for null pointer.

 Assorted code cleanups and a minor fix.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sb/parse-object-buffer-eaten (2013-07-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-07-18 at 364689c)
 + parse_object_buffer: correct freeing the buffer

 Will merge to 'master'.


* tr/do-not-call-submodules-subprojects (2013-07-18) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-07-18 at 6386fd5)
 + show-branch: fix description of --date-order
 + apply, entry: speak of submodules instead of subprojects

 Will merge to 'master'.


* tr/protect-low-3-fds (2013-07-17) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-07-18 at 504d972)
 + git: ensure 0/1/2 are open in main()
 + daemon/shell: refactor redirection of 0/1/2 from /dev/null

 When "git" is spawned in such a way that any of the low 3 file
 descriptors is closed, our first open() may yield file descriptor 2,
 and writing error message to it would screw things up in a big way.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/diff-2.0-remove-q-synonym-for-no-deletion (2013-07-18) 1 commit
 - diff: remove "diff-files -q" at Git 2.0 version boundary
 (this branch uses jc/diff-filter-negation.)

 This obviously has to wait until Git 2.0.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* rj/read-default-config-in-show-ref-pack-refs (2013-06-17) 3 commits
 - ### DONTMERGE: needs better explanation on what config they need
 - pack-refs.c: Add missing call to git_config()
 - show-ref.c: Add missing call to git_config()

 The changes themselves are probably good, but it is unclear what
 basic setting needs to be read for which exact operation.

 Waiting for clarification.
 $gmane/228294


* jh/shorten-refname (2013-05-07) 4 commits
 - t1514: refname shortening is done after dereferencing symbolic refs
 - shorten_unambiguous_ref(): Fix shortening refs/remotes/origin/HEAD to origin
 - t1514: Demonstrate failure to correctly shorten "refs/remotes/origin/HEAD"
 - t1514: Add tests of shortening refnames in strict/loose mode

 When remotes/origin/HEAD is not a symbolic ref, "rev-parse
 --abbrev-ref remotes/origin/HEAD" ought to show "origin", not
 "origin/HEAD", which is fixed with this series (if it is a symbolic
 ref that points at remotes/origin/something, then it should show
 "origin/something" and it already does).

 Expecting a reroll, as an early part of a larger series.
 $gmane/225137


* jl/submodule-mv (2013-04-23) 5 commits
 . submodule.c: duplicate real_path's return value
 . rm: delete .gitmodules entry of submodules removed from the work tree
 . Teach mv to update the path entry in .gitmodules for moved submodules
 . Teach mv to move submodules using a gitfile
 . Teach mv to move submodules together with their work trees

 "git mv A B" when moving a submodule A does "the right thing",
 inclusing relocating its working tree and adjusting the paths in
 the .gitmodules file.

 Ejected from 'pu', as it conflicts with nd/magic-pathspec.


* jk/list-objects-sans-blobs (2013-06-06) 4 commits
 . archive: ignore blob objects when checking reachability
 . list-objects: optimize "revs->blob_objects = 0" case
 . upload-archive: restrict remote objects with reachability check
 . clear parsed flag when we free tree buffers

 Attempt to allow "archive --remote=$there $arbitrary_sha1" while
 keeping the reachability safety.

 Seems to break some tests in a trivial and obvious way.


* mg/more-textconv (2013-05-10) 7 commits
 - grep: honor --textconv for the case rev:path
 - grep: allow to use textconv filters
 - t7008: demonstrate behavior of grep with textconv
 - cat-file: do not die on --textconv without textconv filters
 - show: honor --textconv for blobs
 - diff_opt: track whether flags have been set explicitly
 - t4030: demonstrate behavior of show with textconv

 Make "git grep" and "git show" pay attention to --textconv when
 dealing with blob objects.

 I thought this was pretty well designed and executed, but it seems
 there are some doubts on the list; kicked back to 'pu'.


* mh/multimail (2013-07-15) 2 commits
 - post-receive-email: deprecate script in favor of git-multimail
 - git-multimail: an improved replacement for post-receive-email

 An enhanced "post-receive" hook to send e-mail messages.

 Will wait for the review for the tip one to settle and then merge.


* jc/format-patch (2013-04-22) 2 commits
 - format-patch: --inline-single
 - format-patch: rename "no_inline" field

 A new option to send a single patch to the standard output to be
 appended at the bottom of a message.  I personally have no need for
 this, but it was easy enough to cobble together.  Tests, docs and
 stripping out more MIMEy stuff are left as exercises to interested
 parties.

 Not ready for inclusion.

 Will discard unless we hear from anybody who is interested in
 tying its loose ends.


* jk/gitweb-utf8 (2013-04-08) 4 commits
 - gitweb: Fix broken blob action parameters on blob/commitdiff pages
 - gitweb: Don't append ';js=(0|1)' to external links
 - gitweb: Make feed title valid utf8
 - gitweb: Fix utf8 encoding for blob_plain, blobdiff_plain, commitdiff_plain, and patch

 Various fixes to gitweb.

 Drew Northup volunteered to take a look into this.
 $gmane/226216


* jc/show-branch (2013-06-07) 5 commits
 - show-branch: use commit slab to represent bitflags of arbitrary width
 - show-branch.c: remove "all_mask"
 - show-branch.c: abstract out "flags" operation
 - show-branch.c: lift all_mask/all_revs to a global static
 - show-branch.c: update comment style

 Waiting for the final step to lift the hard-limit before sending it out.

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* rr/send-email-ssl-verify (2013-07-18) 1 commit
 - send-email: be explicit with SSL certificate verification

 Waiting for test reports.


* es/check-mailmap (2013-07-13) 2 commits
 - t4203: test check-mailmap command invocation
 - builtin: add git-check-mailmap command

 A new command to allow scripts to query the mailmap information.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jc/check-x-z (2013-07-11) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-07-15 at 62751bc)
 + check-attr -z: a single -z should apply to both input and output
 + check-ignore -z: a single -z should apply to both input and output
 + check-attr: the name of the character is NUL, not NULL
 + check-ignore: the name of the character is NUL, not NULL

 "git check-ignore -z" applied the NUL termination to both its input
 (with --stdin) and its output, but "git check-attr -z" ignored the
 option on the output side.

 This is potentially a backward incompatible fix.  I am tempted to
 merge this to and keep it in 'next' for a while to see if anybody
 screams before deciding if we want to do anything to help existing
 users (there may be none).

 Waiting for failure reports ;-)


* jk/cat-file-batch-optim (2013-07-18) 9 commits
 - Fix some sparse warnings
 - sha1_object_info_extended: pass object_info to helpers
 - sha1_object_info_extended: make type calculation optional
 - packed_object_info: make type lookup optional
 - packed_object_info: hoist delta type resolution to helper
 - sha1_loose_object_info: make type lookup optional
 - sha1_object_info_extended: rename "status" to "type"
 - cat-file: disable object/refname ambiguity check for batch mode
 - Merge branch 'nd/warn-ambiguous-object-name' into jk/cat-file-batch-optim

 If somebody wants to only know on-disk footprint of an object
 without having to know its type or payload size, we can bypass a
 lot of code to cheaply learn it.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/t0008-sigpipe-fix (2013-07-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-07-15 at cead4b2)
 + t0008: avoid SIGPIPE race condition on fifo

 Fix for recent test breakage on 'master'.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* mk/upload-pack-off-by-one-dead-code-removal (2013-07-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-07-15 at a8f55a2)
 + upload-pack: remove a piece of dead code

 Will merge to 'master'.


* tf/gitweb-ss-tweak (2013-07-15) 4 commits
 - gitweb: make search help link less ugly
 - gitweb: omit the repository owner when it is unset
 - gitweb: vertically centre contents of page footer
 - gitweb: ensure OPML text fits inside its box

 Waiting for comments.


* tr/fd-gotcha-fixes (2013-07-12) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-07-18 at 30f4fdf)
 + run-command: dup_devnull(): guard against syscalls failing
 + git_mkstemps: correctly test return value of open()

 Two places we did not check return value (expected to be a file
 descriptor) correctly.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/mailmap-case-insensitivity (2013-07-15) 9 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-07-18 at 83341ac)
 + mailmap: style fixes
 + mailmap: debug: avoid passing NULL to fprintf() '%s' conversion specification
 + mailmap: debug: eliminate -Wformat field precision type warning
 + mailmap: debug: fix malformed fprintf() format conversion specification
 + mailmap: debug: fix out-of-order fprintf() arguments
 + mailmap: do not downcase mailmap entries
 + t4203: demonstrate loss of uppercase characters in canonical email
 + mailmap: do not lose single-letter names
 + t4203: demonstrate loss of single-character name in mailmap entry

 The mailmap mechanism unnecessarily downcased the e-mail addresses
 in the output, and also ignored the human name when it is a single
 character name.

 This now has become Eric Sunshine's series, even though it still is
 under jc/ hierarchy.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ms/fetch-prune-configuration (2013-07-18) 1 commit
 - fetch: make --prune configurable

 Allow fetch.prune and remote.*.prune configuration variables to be set,
 and "git fetch" to behave as if "--prune" is given.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/gcc-function-attributes (2013-07-09) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-07-12 at 5a7081f)
 + wt-status: use "format" function attribute for status_printf
 + use "sentinel" function attribute for variadic lists
 + add missing "format" function attributes

 Use the function attributes extension to catch mistakes in use of
 our own variadic functions that use NULL sentinel at the end
 (i.e. like execl(3)) and format strings (i.e. like printf(3)).

 Will merge to 'master'.


* km/http-curl-config-per-url (2013-07-12) 2 commits
 - config: add support for http.<url>.* settings
 - http.c: fix parsing of http.sslCertPasswordProtected variable

 Allows custom curl configuration per URL when talking over http.

 There is a reroll that needs to be picked up after discussion.


* hv/config-from-blob (2013-07-12) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-07-15 at 9ab7f3f)
 + do not die when error in config parsing of buf occurs
 + teach config --blob option to parse config from database
 + config: make parsing stack struct independent from actual data source
 + config: drop cf validity check in get_next_char()
 + config: factor out config file stack management

 Allow configuration data to be read from in-tree blob objects,
 which would help working in a bare repository and submodule
 updates.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/name-rev-exact-ref (2013-07-18) 5 commits

 + describe: fix --contains when a tag is given as input
 + name-rev: differentiate between tags and commits they point at
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-07-11 at fd5b30c)
 + describe: use argv-array
 + name-rev: allow converting the exact object name at the tip of a ref
 + name-ref: factor out name shortening logic from name_ref()

 Corrects the longstanding sloppiness in the implementation of
 name-rev that conflated "we take commit-ish" and "differences
 between tags and commits do not matter".

 Will merge to 'master'.

 + git-svn: allow git-svn fetching to work using serf
 + Git.pm: add new temp_is_locked function

 Subversion 1.8.0 that was recently released breaks older subversion
 clients coming over http/https in various ways.

 Are people on older Subversion happy with this change?


* tr/merge-recursive-index-only (2013-07-07) 3 commits
 - merge-recursive: -Xindex-only to leave worktree unchanged
 - merge-recursive: untangle double meaning of o->call_depth
 - merge-recursive: remove dead conditional in update_stages()


* jc/push-cas (2013-07-17) 6 commits
 - t5533: test "push --lockref"
 - push --lockref: tie it all together
 - push --lockref: implement logic to populate old_sha1_expect[]
 - remote.c: add command line option parser for "--lockref"
 - builtin/push.c: use OPT_BOOL, not OPT_BOOLEAN
 - cache.h: move remote/connect API out of it

 Allow a safer "rewind of the remote tip" push than blind "--force",
 by requiring that the overwritten remote ref to be unchanged since
 the new history to replace it was prepared.

 The machinery is more or less ready.  The "--force" option is again
 the big red button to override any safety, thanks to J6t's sanity
 (the original round allowed --lockref to defeat --force).  The
 logic to choose the default for --lockref is suitable only for the
 simplest workflows, and may hurt users more than help them.

 Waiting for comments.

 + Convert "struct cache_entry *" to "const ..." wherever possible

 Will merge to 'master'.


* es/contacts (2013-07-03) 3 commits
 - contrib: contacts: interpret committish akin to format-patch
 - contrib: contacts: add ability to parse from committish
 - contrib: add git-contacts helper

 A helper to read from a set of format-patch output files or a range
 of commits and find those who may have insights to the code that
 the changes touch by running a series of "git blame" commands.

 Still needs to add mailmap support and other niceties but the
 basics already look sound, and the enhancements can be done
 in-tree. Assuming that "git contact" is something we may want to
 have as a member of the official set of commands someday, that is.

 Perhaps this should be rebased on es/check-mailmap to utilize it.


* jc/pull-training-wheel (2013-07-18) 1 commit
 - pull: require choice between rebase/merge on non-fast-forward pull

 Make "git pull" (without arguments that say what branch to
 integrate from where) refuse with "it does not fast forward; choose
 between 'pull --merge' and 'pull --rebase'".

 Waiting for the discussion to settle.


* jc/reflog-doc (2013-06-19) 1 commit
 - setup_reflog_action: document the rules for using GIT_REFLOG_ACTION

 Document rules to use GIT_REFLOG_ACTION variable in the scripted
 Porcelain.  git-rebase--interactive locally violates this, but it
 is a leaf user that does not call out to or dot-sources other
 scripts, so fixing it is not all that urgent.


* mh/ref-races-optim-invalidate-cached (2013-06-20) 1 commit
 - refs: do not invalidate the packed-refs cache unnecessarily

 This requires the platform lstat() to be correct to avoid false
 negatives.


* jx/clean-interactive (2013-06-26) 16 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-07-12 at 61dd42d)
 + test: run testcases with POSIX absolute paths on Windows
 + test: add t7301 for git-clean--interactive
 + git-clean: add documentation for interactive git-clean
 + git-clean: add ask each interactive action
 + git-clean: add select by numbers interactive action
 + git-clean: add filter by pattern interactive action
 + git-clean: use a git-add-interactive compatible UI
 + git-clean: add colors to interactive git-clean
 + git-clean: show items of del_list in columns
 + git-clean: add support for -i/--interactive
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-06-26 at f7be2d8)
 + git-clean: refactor git-clean into two phases
 + write_name{_quoted_relative,}(): remove redundant parameters
 + quote_path_relative(): remove redundant parameter
 + quote.c: substitute path_relative with relative_path
 + path.c: refactor relative_path(), not only strip prefix
 + test: add test cases for relative_path

 Add "interactive" mode to "git clean".

 The early part to refactor relative path related helper functions
 looked sensible.

 Will merge to 'master'.
