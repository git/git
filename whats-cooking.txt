What's cooking in git.git (Nov 2018, #02; Fri, 2)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

* cb/printf-empty-format (2018-10-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-01 at 9fcb05f22c)
 + sequencer: cleanup for gcc warning in non developer mode
 (this branch uses ag/rebase-i-in-c; is tangled with ag/sequencer-reduce-rewriting-todo, js/rebase-autostash-fix, js/rebase-i-break, js/rebase-i-shortopt, js/rebase-in-c-5.5-work-with-rebase-i-in-c and pk/rebase-in-c-6-final.)

  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-19 at 08c9d86ffd)
 + rebase: fix typoes in error messages
 (this branch uses pk/rebase-in-c, pk/rebase-in-c-2-basic, pk/rebase-in-c-3-acts, pk/rebase-in-c-4-opts and pk/rebase-in-c-5-test; is tangled with js/rebase-autostash-fix, js/rebase-in-c-5.5-work-with-rebase-i-in-c and pk/rebase-in-c-6-final.)

 Typofix.


* js/rebase-autostash-fix (2018-10-24) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-29 at 680e648001)
 + rebase --autostash: fix issue with dirty submodules
 + rebase --autostash: demonstrate a problem with dirty submodules
 + rebase (autostash): use an explicit OID to apply the stash
 + rebase (autostash): store the full OID in <state-dir>/autostash
 + rebase (autostash): avoid duplicate call to state_dir_path()
 (this branch uses ag/rebase-i-in-c, js/rebase-in-c-5.5-work-with-rebase-i-in-c, pk/rebase-in-c, pk/rebase-in-c-2-basic, pk/rebase-in-c-3-acts, pk/rebase-in-c-4-opts, pk/rebase-in-c-5-test and pk/rebase-in-c-6-final; is tangled with ag/sequencer-reduce-rewriting-todo, cb/printf-empty-format, jc/rebase-in-c-5-test-typofix, js/rebase-i-break and js/rebase-i-shortopt.)

 "git rebase" that has recently been rewritten in C had a few issues
 in its "--autstash" feature, which have been corrected.


* js/rebase-i-break (2018-10-12) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-19 at 6db9b14495)
 + rebase -i: introduce the 'break' command
 + rebase -i: clarify what happens on a failed `exec`
 (this branch is used by js/rebase-i-shortopt; uses ag/rebase-i-in-c; is tangled with ag/sequencer-reduce-rewriting-todo, cb/printf-empty-format, js/rebase-autostash-fix, js/rebase-in-c-5.5-work-with-rebase-i-in-c and pk/rebase-in-c-6-final.)

 "git rebase -i" learned a new insn, 'break', that the user can
 insert in the to-do list.  Upon hitting it, the command returns
 control back to the user.


* js/rebase-i-shortopt (2018-10-26) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-01 at 4e9da19145)
 + rebase -i: recognize short commands without arguments
 (this branch uses ag/rebase-i-in-c and js/rebase-i-break; is tangled with ag/sequencer-reduce-rewriting-todo, cb/printf-empty-format, js/rebase-autostash-fix, js/rebase-in-c-5.5-work-with-rebase-i-in-c and pk/rebase-in-c-6-final.)

 "git rebase -i" learned to take 'b' as the short form of 'break'
 option in the todo list.


* js/rebase-in-c-5.5-work-with-rebase-i-in-c (2018-10-11) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-19 at b734d81006)
 + builtin rebase: prepare for builtin rebase -i
 + Merge branch 'ag/rebase-i-in-c' into js/rebase-in-c-5.5-work-with-rebase-i-in-c
 (this branch is used by js/rebase-autostash-fix and pk/rebase-in-c-6-final; uses ag/rebase-i-in-c, pk/rebase-in-c, pk/rebase-in-c-2-basic, pk/rebase-in-c-3-acts, pk/rebase-in-c-4-opts and pk/rebase-in-c-5-test; is tangled with ag/sequencer-reduce-rewriting-todo, cb/printf-empty-format, jc/rebase-in-c-5-test-typofix, js/rebase-i-break and js/rebase-i-shortopt.)

 "rebase" that has been rewritten learns the new calling convention
 used by "rebase -i" that was rewritten in C, tying the loose end
 between two GSoC topics that stomped on each other's toes.


* pk/rebase-in-c (2018-08-06) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-19 at 26c29ace53)

[New Topics]

* ab/dynamic-gettext-poison (2018-11-02) 1 commit
 - i18n: make GETTEXT_POISON a runtime option


* js/rebase-p-tests (2018-11-02) 3 commits
 - tests: optionally skip `git rebase -p` tests
 - t3418: decouple test cases from a previous `rebase -p` test case
 - t3404: decouple some test cases from outcomes of previous test cases

 In preparation to the day when we can deprecate and remove the
 "rebase -p", make sure we can skip and later remove tests for
 it.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sg/travis-install-dependencies (2018-11-02) 1 commit
 - travis-ci: install packages in 'ci/install-dependencies.sh'
 (this branch uses ss/travis-ci-force-vm-mode.)

 The procedure to install dependencies before testing at Travis CI
 is getting revamped for both simplicity and flexibility, taking
 advantage of the recent move to the vm-based environment.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* lt/date-human (2018-07-09) 1 commit
 - Add 'human' date format

 A new date format "--date=human" that morphs its output depending
 on how far the time is from the current time has been introduced.
 "--date=auto" can be used to use this new format when the output is
 goint to the pager or to the terminal and otherwise the default
 format.

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* ab/push-dwim-dst (2018-10-29) 9 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - push doc: document the DWYM behavior pushing to unqualified <dst>
 - push: add DWYM support for "git push refs/remotes/...:<dst>"
 - push: test that <src> doesn't DWYM if <dst> is unqualified
 - push: add an advice on unqualified <dst> push
 - push: move unqualified refname error into a function
 - push: improve the error shown on unqualified <dst> push
 - i18n: remote.c: mark error(...) messages for translation
 - remote.c: add braces in anticipation of a follow-up change

 "git push $there $src:$dst" rejects when $dst is not a fully
 qualified refname and not clear what the end user meant.  The
 codepath has been taught to give a clearer error message, and also
 guess where the push should go by taking the type of the pushed
 object into account (e.g. a tag object would want to go under
 refs/tags/).

 The last few steps are questionable.
 cf. <87in1lkw54.fsf@evledraar.gmail.com>


* md/list-lazy-objects-fix (2018-10-29) 1 commit
 - list-objects.c: don't segfault for missing cmdline objects

 "git rev-list --exclude-promissor-objects" had to take an object
 that does not exist locally (and is lazily available) from the
 command line without barfing, but the code dereferenced NULL.

 That sympotom may be worth addressing, but I think the "fix" is
 overly broad and is wrong.  Giving a missing object should be
 diagnosed as an error, not swept under the rug silently.


* nd/i18n (2018-10-29) 12 commits
 - fsck: mark strings for translation
 - parse-options.c: mark more strings for translation
 - parse-options: replace opterror() with optname()
 - repack: mark more strings for translation
 - remote.c: mark messages for translation
 - reflog: mark strings for translation
 - read-cache.c: add missing colon separators
 - read-cache.c: mark more strings for translation
 - attr.c: mark more string for translation
 - archive.c: mark more strings for translation
 - alias.c: mark split_cmdline_strerror() strings for translation
 - git.c: mark more strings for translation

 More _("i18n") markings.

 Some changes seem not to be mere mechanical convesions and needs
 a careful review.

 - thread-utils: macros to unconditionally compile pthreads API

 The codebase has been cleaned up to reduce "#ifndef NO_PTHREADS".


* nd/wildmatch-double-asterisk (2018-10-29) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-01 at 627186d020)
 + wildmatch: change behavior of "foo**bar" in WM_PATHNAME mode

 A pattern with '**' that does not have a slash on either side used
 to be an invalid one, but the code now treats such double-asterisks
 the same way as two normal asterisks that happen to be adjacent to
 each other.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 Code cleanup.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* js/mingw-ns-filetime (2018-10-24) 3 commits

 + mingw: implement nanosecond-precision file times
 + mingw: replace MSVCRT's fstat() with a Win32-based implementation

  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-01 at 289e6bcece)
 + speed up refresh_index() by utilizing preload_index()

 The helper function to refresh the cached stat information in the
 in-core index has learned to perform the lstat() part of the
 operation in parallel on multi-core platforms.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* sg/test-verbose-log (2018-10-30) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-01 at 0c4a18a71f)
 + test-lib: introduce the '-V' short option for '--verbose-log'

 Our test scripts can now take the '-V' option as a synonym for the
 '--verbose-log' option.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ab/pack-tests-cleanup (2018-10-31) 3 commits
 - index-pack tests: don't leave test repo dirty at end
 - pack-objects tests: don't leave test .git corrupt at end
 - pack-objects test: modernize style

 A couple of tests used to leave the repository in a state that is
 deliberately corrupt, which have been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/detect-truncated-zlib-input (2018-10-31) 4 commits
 - Adjust for 2.19.x series
 - cat-file: handle streaming failures consistently

 - t1450: check large blob in trailing-garbage test

 A regression in Git 2.12 era made "git fsck" fall into an infinite
 loop while processing truncated loose objects.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/proto-v2-ref-prefix-fix (2018-10-31) 2 commits
 - ls-remote: pass heads/tags prefixes to transport
 - ls-remote: do not send ref prefixes for patterns

 "git ls-remote $there foo" was broken by recent update for the
 protocol v2 and stopped showing refs that match 'foo' that are not
 refs/{heads,tags}/foo, which has been fixed.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 Split the overly large Documentation/config.txt file into million
 little pieces.  This potentially allows each individual piece
 included into the manual page of the command it affects more easily.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 This is a painful conversions while many other topics in flight
 wants to add to or edit the documentation of configuration
 variables.


* nd/per-worktree-config (2018-10-22) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-01 at 3746343ca8)
 + worktree: add per-worktree config files
 + t1300: extract and use test_cmp_config()

 A fourth class of configuration files (in addition to the
 traditional "system wide", "per user in the $HOME directory" and
 "per repository in the $GIT_DIR/config") has been introduced so
 that different worktrees that share the same repository (hence the
 same $GIT_DIR/config file) can use different customization.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* nd/submodule-unused-vars (2018-10-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-29 at 33641dcc89)
 + submodule.c: remove some of the_repository references

 Code clean-up.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* nd/unpack-trees-with-cache-tree (2018-10-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-29 at de51b606da)
 + read-cache: use of memory after it is freed

 Trivial bugfix.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ag/rev-parse-all-exclude-fix (2018-11-01) 1 commit
 - rev-parse: clear --exclude list after 'git rev-parse --all'

 "git rev-parse --exclude=* --branches --branches"  (i.e. first
 saying "add only things that do not match '*' out of all branches"
 and then adding all branches, without any exclusion this time")
 worked as expected, but "--exclude=* --all --all" did not work the
 same way, which has been fixed.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* bp/reset-quiet (2018-10-24) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-29 at 71f4fbc802)
 + reset: warn when refresh_index() takes more than 2 seconds
 + reset: add new reset.quiet config setting
 + reset: don't compute unstaged changes after reset when --quiet
 (this branch is used by nd/config-split.)

 "git reset --quiet" no longer runs "update-index --refresh"
 internally, which shifts the refresh cost away from the command.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* js/remote-archive-dwimfix (2018-10-26) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-26 at f5bf6946bd)
 + archive: initialize archivers earlier

 The logic to determine the archive type "git archive" uses did not
 correctly kick in for "git archive --remote", which has been
 corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* js/shallow-and-fetch-prune (2018-10-25) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-26 at 93b7196560)
 + repack -ad: prune the list of shallow commits
 + shallow: offer to prune only non-existing entries
 + repack: point out a bug handling stale shallow info

 "git repack" in a shallow clone did not correctly update the
 shallow points in the repository, leading to a repository that
 does not pass fsck.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jw/send-email-no-auth (2018-10-23) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-29 at a3fbbdb889)
 + send-email: explicitly disable authentication

 "git send-email" learned to disable SMTP authentication via the
 "--smtp-auth=none" option, even when the smtp username is given
 (which turns the authentication on by default).

 Will merge to 'master'.


* md/exclude-promisor-objects-fix (2018-10-23) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-29 at fb36a5dcbe)
 + exclude-promisor-objects: declare when option is allowed
 + Documentation/git-log.txt: do not show --exclude-promisor-objects

 Operations on promisor objects make sense in the context of only a
 small subset of the commands that internally use the revisions
 machinery, but the "--exclude-promisor-objects" option were taken
 and led to nonsense results by commands like "log", to which it
 didn't make much sense.  This has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* mg/gpg-fingerprint (2018-10-23) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-26 at 1e219cb754)
 + gpg-interface.c: obtain primary key fingerprint as well
 + gpg-interface.c: support getting key fingerprint via %GF format
 + gpg-interface.c: use flags to determine key/signer info presence
 (this branch uses mg/gpg-parse-tighten; is tangled with jc/gpg-cocci-preincr.)

 New "--pretty=format:" placeholders %GF and %GP that show the GPG
 key fingerprints have been invented.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/http-curlver-warnings (2018-10-26) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-26 at 870e125cec)
 + http: give curl version warnings consistently
 (this branch uses js/mingw-http-ssl; is tangled with nd/config-split.)

 Warning message fix.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* sd/stash-wo-user-name (2018-11-02) 1 commit
 - t3903-stash: test without configured user.name and user.email

 An early part of a wip.


* sg/test-rebase-editor-fix (2018-10-29) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-01 at 271e0fc663)

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ss/travis-ci-force-vm-mode (2018-10-26) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-01 at 8596bb2a65)
 + travis-ci: no longer use containers
 (this branch is used by sg/travis-install-dependencies.)

 The "container" mode of TravisCI is going away.  Our .travis.yml
 file is getting prepared for the transition.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* tb/char-may-be-unsigned (2018-10-26) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-01 at 9e14f289f8)

 Build portability fix.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jt/upload-pack-v2-fix-shallow (2018-10-19) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-29 at d9010b3c7b)
 + upload-pack: clear flags before each v2 request
 + upload-pack: make want_obj not global
 + upload-pack: make have_obj not global

 "git fetch" over protocol v2 into a shallow repository failed to
 fetch full history behind a new tip of history that was diverged
 before the cut-off point of the history that was previously fetched
 shallowly.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* pw/am-rebase-read-author-script (2018-11-01) 5 commits
 - sequencer: use read_author_script()
 - add read_author_script() to libgit
 - am: rename read_author_script()
 - am: improve author-script error reporting
 - am: don't die in read_author_script()

 Unify code to read the author-script used in "git am" and the
 commands that use the sequencer machinery, e.g. "git rebase -i".

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sb/submodule-url-to-absolute (2018-10-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-29 at 4264c150cb)
 + submodule helper: convert relative URL to absolute URL if needed

 Some codepaths failed to form a proper URL when .gitmodules record
 the URL to a submodule repository as relative to the repository of
 superproject, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* en/merge-cleanup-more (2018-10-18) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-26 at c706319c26)
 + merge-recursive: avoid showing conflicts with merge branch before HEAD
 + merge-recursive: improve auto-merging messages with path collisions
 (this branch is used by en/merge-path-collision.)

 Further clean-up of merge-recursive machinery.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* mg/gpg-parse-tighten (2018-10-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-26 at efdec77193)
 + gpg-interface.c: detect and reject multiple signatures on commits
 (this branch is used by jc/gpg-cocci-preincr and mg/gpg-fingerprint.)

 Detect and reject a signature block that has more than one GPG
 signature.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* bc/sha-256 (2018-10-25) 12 commits
 - hash: add an SHA-256 implementation using OpenSSL
 - sha256: add an SHA-256 implementation using libgcrypt
 - Add a base implementation of SHA-256 support
 - commit-graph: convert to using the_hash_algo
 - t/helper: add a test helper to compute hash speed
 - sha1-file: add a constant for hash block size

 - t: add basic tests for our SHA-1 implementation
 - cache: make hashcmp and hasheq work with larger hashes
 - hex: introduce functions to print arbitrary hashes
 - sha1-file: provide functions to look up hash algorithms
 - sha1-file: rename algorithm to "sha1"

 Add sha-256 hash and plug it through the code to allow building Git
 with the "NewHash".

 Expecting a reroll.

* js/mingw-http-ssl (2018-10-26) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-26 at 318e82e101)
 + http: when using Secure Channel, ignore sslCAInfo by default
 + http: add support for disabling SSL revocation checks in cURL
 + http: add support for selecting SSL backends at runtime
 (this branch is used by jc/http-curlver-warnings and nd/config-split.)

 On platforms with recent cURL library, http.sslBackend configuration
 variable can be used to choose a different SSL backend at runtime.
 The Windows port uses this mechanism to switch between OpenSSL and
 Secure Channel while talking over the HTTPS protocol.

 - zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".


* jc/war-on-string-list (2018-11-01) 1 commit
 - fetch: replace string-list used as a look-up table with a hashmap

 Replace three string-list instances used as look-up tables in "git
 fetch" with hashmaps.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* js/remote-archive-v2 (2018-09-28) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-12 at 5f34377f60)
 + archive: allow archive over HTTP(S) with proto v2
 + archive: implement protocol v2 archive command
 + archive: use packet_reader for communications
 + archive: follow test standards around assertions

 The original implementation of "git archive --remote" more or less
 bypassed the transport layer and did not work over http(s).  The
 version 2 of the protocol is defined to allow going over http(s) as
 well as Git native transport.

 Will hold.
 cf. <20181016212008.GA249669@google.com>
 Breaks interoperability.


* ag/sequencer-reduce-rewriting-todo (2018-10-09) 16 commits
 . rebase--interactive: move transform_todo_file() to rebase--interactive.c
 . sequencer: fix a call to error() in transform_todo_file()
 . sequencer: use edit_todo_list() in complete_action()
 . rebase-interactive: rewrite edit_todo_list() to handle the initial edit
 . rebase-interactive: append_todo_help() changes
 . rebase-interactive: use todo_list_transform() in edit_todo_list()
 . sequencer: refactor skip_unnecessary_picks() to work on a todo_list
 . sequencer: change complete_action() to use the refactored functions
 . sequencer: make sequencer_make_script() write its script to a strbuf
 . sequencer: refactor transform_todos() to work on a todo_list
 . sequencer: refactor rearrange_squash() to work on a todo_list
 . sequencer: refactor sequencer_add_exec_commands() to work on a todo_list
 . sequencer: refactor check_todo_list() to work on a todo_list
 . sequencer: make the todo_list structure public
 . sequencer: clear the number of items of a todo_list before parsing
 . Merge branch 'ag/rebase-i-in-c' into ag/sequencer-reduce-rewriting-todo

 The scripted version of "git rebase -i" wrote and rewrote the todo
 list many times during a single step of its operation, and the
 recent C-rewrite made a faithful conversion of the logic to C.  The
 implementation has been updated to carry necessary information
 around in-core to avoid rewriting the same file over and over
 unnecessarily.

 A reroll exists but is based on a stale codebase and is painful to
 merge.

 The code to traverse objects for reachability, used to decide what
 objects are unreferenced and expendable, have been taught to also
 consider per-worktree refs of other worktrees as starting points to
 prevent data loss.
