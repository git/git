What's cooking in git.git (May 2011, #08; Mon, 16)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.

The main part of this cycle is expected to run thru May, aiming for a
feature freeze in early June.

We are at the beginning of week #4 of this cycle.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* jk/cherry-pick-root-with-resolve (2011-05-16) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-05-16 at 2a63845)
 + t3503: test cherry picking and reverting root commits
 + revert: allow reverting a root commit
 + cherry-pick: handle root commits with external strategies

Will merge to "master" soonish, to merge further to "maint" later.

* jk/git-connection-deadlock-fix (2011-05-16) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-05-16 at 33e6c11)
 + send-pack: avoid deadlock on git:// push with failed pack-objects
 + connect: let callers know if connection is a socket
 + connect: treat generic proxy processes like ssh processes
 (this branch uses js/maint-1.6.6-send-pack-stateless-rpc-deadlock-fix; is tangled with js/maint-send-pack-stateless-rpc-deadlock-fix.)

Will merge to "master" soonish, to merge further to "maint" later.

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* ci/commit--interactive-atomic (2011-05-10) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-05-11 at 7f36fd8)
 + Test atomic git-commit --interactive
 + Add commit to list of config.singlekey commands
 + Add support for -p/--patch to git-commit
 + Allow git commit --interactive with paths
 + t7501.8: feed a meaningful command
 + Use a temporary index for git commit --interactive

* fc/completion-zsh (2011-05-10) 1 commit
 + git-completion: fix regression in zsh support
 (this branch is used by sg/completion-updates.)

* jc/convert (2011-05-09) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-05-15 at 9d35a6e)
 + convert: make it harder to screw up adding a conversion attribute
 + convert: make it safer to add conversion attributes
 + convert: give saner names to crlf/eol variables, types and functions
 + convert: rename the "eol" global variable to "core_eol"
 (this branch is used by jc/streaming.)

* kk/maint-prefix-in-config-mak (2011-05-09) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-05-09 at 267a3aa)
 + Honor $(prefix) set in config.mak* when defining ETC_GIT*
 + Revert "Honor $(prefix) set in config.mak* when defining ETC_GIT* and sysconfdir"
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-05-02 at c747ba3)
 + Honor $(prefix) set in config.mak* when defining ETC_GIT* and sysconfdir

One revert and replace the whole thing from J6t. The end result looked
reasonable.

* mg/merge-ff-config (2011-05-06) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-05-08 at 977b432)
 + tests: check git does not barf on merge.ff values for future versions of git
 + merge: introduce merge.ff configuration variable
 + Merge branch 'jc/maint-branch-mergeoptions' into mg/merge-ff-config

* sg/completion-updates (2011-05-10) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-05-10 at eaf5398)
 + Merge branch 'fc/completion-zsh' into sg/completion-updates
 + Revert "completion: don't declare 'local words' to make zsh happy"
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-05-08 at 761178c)
 + completion: move private shopt shim for zsh to __git_ namespace
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-05-02 at 0fd443a)
 + completion: don't declare 'local words' to make zsh happy
 (this branch uses fc/completion-zsh.)

This reverts the "local words only on bash" thingy and uses the
workaround blessed by zsh folks instead.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* mg/diff-stat-count (2011-05-03) 2 commits
 - diff-options.txt: describe --stat-{width,name-width,count}
 - diff: introduce --stat-count to limit the stat lines

There was a miscounting spotted.  Need another round.

* jn/gitweb-js (2011-04-28) 13 commits
 - gitweb: Make JavaScript ability to adjust timezones configurable
 - gitweb.js: Add UI for selecting common timezone to display dates
 - gitweb: JavaScript ability to adjust time based on timezone
 - gitweb: Unify the way long timestamp is displayed
 - gitweb: Refactor generating of long dates into format_timestamp_html
 - gitweb.js: Provide getElementsByClassName method (if it not exists)
 - gitweb.js: Introduce code to handle cookies from JavaScript
 - gitweb.js: Extract and improve datetime handling
 - gitweb.js: Provide default values for padding in padLeftStr and padLeft
 - gitweb.js: Update and improve comments in JavaScript files
 - gitweb: Split JavaScript for maintability, combining on build
 - Remove gitweb/gitweb.cgi and other legacy targets from main Makefile
 - git-instaweb: Simplify build dependency on gitweb

Rerolled.  Waiting for comments.

* jn/ctags-more (2011-04-29) 3 commits
 - gitweb: Optional grouping of projects by category
 - gitweb: Modularized git_get_project_description to be more generic
 - gitweb: Split git_project_list_body in two functions

Waiting for comments.

* jc/require-work-tree-exists (2011-05-08) 1 commit
 - require-work-tree wants more than what its name says

Make "git pull" run from a random place work as long as GIT_DIR and
GIT_WORK_TREE are set up correctly.  I am not absolutely sure if that
is a sane use case, though. May drop.

* jc/add-delete-default (2011-04-27) 1 commit
 - git add: notice removal of tracked paths by default

* jk/maint-merge-rename-create (2011-03-25) 3 commits
 - merge: turn on rewrite detection
 - merge: handle renames with replacement content
 - t3030: fix accidental success in symlink rename

Peff wanted to reroll this.

* jc/index-pack (2011-02-27) 5 commits
 - index-pack --verify: read anomalous offsets from v2 idx file
 - write_idx_file: need_large_offset() helper function
 - index-pack: --verify
 - write_idx_file: introduce a struct to hold idx customization options
 - index-pack: group the delta-base array entries also by type

Still a WIP. Need to put histogram output into index-pack --verify to
really kill verify-pack.

* jc/dotdot-is-parent-directory (2011-05-04) 1 commit
 - specifying ranges: we did not mean to make ".." an empty set

Updated documentation, but I do not feel a strong enough annoyance to push
this forward. May drop.

* jk/tag-contains (2010-07-05) 4 commits
 - Why is "git tag --contains" so slow?
 - default core.clockskew variable to one day
 - limit "contains" traversals based on commit timestamp
 - tag: speed up --contains calculation

The idea of the bottom one is probably Ok, except that the use of object
flags needs to be rethought, or at least the helper needs to be moved to
builtin/tag.c to make it clear that it should not be used outside the
current usage context.

* jc/advice-about-to-lose-commit (2011-05-06) 1 commit
 - checkout: honor advice.detachedHead when reattaching to a branch

Needs to tighten the advice to only govern the generic How-to part.

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* jc/replacing (2011-05-15) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-05-16 at 5d0b584)
 + read_sha1_file(): allow selective bypassing of replacement mechanism
 + inline lookup_replace_object() calls
 + read_sha1_file(): get rid of read_sha1_file_repl() madness
 + t6050: make sure we test not just commit replacement
 + Declare lookup_replace_object() in cache.h, not in commit.h
 (this branch is used by jc/streaming.)

Code restructuring without much new feature.
Will merge to "master" by the end of week #4.

* jh/receive-count-limit (2011-05-14) 1 commit
 - receive-pack: Add receive.objectCountLimit to refuse push with too many objects

Being rerolled.

* jl/submodule-conflicted-gitmodules (2011-05-14) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-05-16 at cc6c7e8)
 + Submodules: Don't parse .gitmodules when it contains, merge conflicts
 + test that git status works with merge conflict in, .gitmodules

Will merge to "master" by the end of week #4.

* js/maint-1.6.6-send-pack-stateless-rpc-deadlock-fix (2011-05-16) 1 commit
 + sideband_demux(): fix decl-after-stmt
 (this branch is used by jk/git-connection-deadlock-fix and js/maint-send-pack-stateless-rpc-deadlock-fix.)

Will merge to "master" soonish, to merge further to "maint" later.

* js/maint-send-pack-stateless-rpc-deadlock-fix (2011-05-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-05-16 at ad83470)
 + Merge branch 'js/maint-1.6.6-send-pack-stateless-rpc-deadlock-fix' into js/maint-send-pack-stateless-rpc-deadlock-fix
 (this branch uses js/maint-1.6.6-send-pack-stateless-rpc-deadlock-fix; is tangled with jk/git-connection-deadlock-fix.)

Will merge to "master" soonish, to merge further to "maint" later.

* jc/maint-1.6.6-pathspec-stdin-and-cmdline (2011-05-11) 1 commit
 + setup_revisions(): take pathspec from command line and --stdin correctly
 (this branch is used by jc/magic-pathspec, jc/maint-1.7.4-pathspec-stdin-and-cmdline and jc/maint-pathspec-stdin-and-cmdline.)

Will merge to "master" soonish, to merge further to "maint" later.

* jc/maint-1.7.4-pathspec-stdin-and-cmdline (2011-05-11) 1 commit
 - Merge branch 'jc/maint-1.6.6-pathspec-stdin-and-cmdline'
 (this branch uses jc/maint-1.6.6-pathspec-stdin-and-cmdline; is tangled with jc/magic-pathspec and jc/maint-pathspec-stdin-and-cmdline.)

Will merge to "master" soonish, to merge further to "maint" later.

* jc/maint-pathspec-stdin-and-cmdline (2011-05-11) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-05-15 at b4e3a75)
 + Merge branch 'jc/maint-1.7.4-pathspec-stdin-and-cmdline'
 + Merge branch 'jc/maint-1.6.6-pathspec-stdin-and-cmdline'
 (this branch uses jc/maint-1.6.6-pathspec-stdin-and-cmdline; is tangled with jc/magic-pathspec and jc/maint-1.7.4-pathspec-stdin-and-cmdline.)

These are to fix an ancient bug where feeding "git log --stdin path" with
an input that also has additional pathspec corrupted memory.

Will merge to "master" soonish, to merge further to "maint" later.

* jl/read-tree-m-dry-run (2011-05-11) 1 commit
 - Teach read-tree the -n|--dry-run option

Looked good. We _might_ want to make -n simply ignore -u, though.
Waiting for a reroll.

* jc/streaming (2011-05-16) 12 commits
 - streaming: read loose objects incrementally
 - sha1_file.c: expose helpers to read loose objects
 - streaming: read non-delta incrementally from a pack
 - streaming_write_entry(): support files with holes
 - streaming_write_entry(): use streaming API in write_entry()
 - streaming: a new API to read from the object store
 - write_entry(): separate two helper functions out
 - unpack_object_header(): make it public
 - sha1_object_info_extended(): hint about objects in delta-base cache
 - sha1_object_info_extended(): expose a bit more info
 - packed_object_info_detail(): do not return a string
 - Merge branches 'jc/convert', 'jc/bigfile' and 'jc/replacing' into jc/streaming
 (this branch uses jc/bigfile and jc/replacing.)

I _think_ the "hole" one does a reasonable job to avoid excessible and
pointless seeks (it operates on 10k chunks and coalesces continuous chunks
full of NULs), which was the concern raised in the review.

* jc/bigfile (2011-05-13) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-05-15 at 0ee7144)
 + Bigfile: teach "git add" to send a large file straight to a pack
 + index_fd(): split into two helper functions
 + index_fd(): turn write_object and format_check arguments into one flag
 (this branch is used by jc/streaming.)

This covers the entry point for a big file to the system. Other parts that
need to know about them are the exit point (i.e. write_entry()), packing
and repacking (as long as bigfilethreshold is sane this should work),
diffs and status (avoid slurping large binary in core only to do nothing,
which we already should), and transport (receive-pack/fetch-pack call
either unpack-objects or index-pack, which still want to hold the full
object in-core and need to be fixed).

Will merge to "master" by the middle of week #5.

* jk/blame-line-porcelain (2011-05-09) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-05-15 at 93232b3)
 + blame: add --line-porcelain output format
 + blame: refactor porcelain output
 + add tests for various blame formats

Will merge to "master" by the end of week #4.

* ms/tagname-does-not-begin-with-dash (2011-05-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-05-15 at 7df0461)
 + tag: disallow '-' as tag name

Will merge to "master" by the end of week #4.

* nd/sparse-co-fix (2011-05-10) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-05-15 at 1a85791)
 + sparse checkout: do not eagerly decide the fate for whole directory
 + t1011: fix sparse-checkout initialization and add new file

Will merge to "master" by the end of week #4.
