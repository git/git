What's cooking in git.git (Jan 2019, #01; Mon, 7)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

The 'master' branch now has the first batch of topics (many of which
have been cooking in 'next' during the pre-release freeze).

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

[Graduated to "master"]

* ab/push-dwim-dst (2018-11-14) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-12-28 at d9f618de10)
 + push doc: document the DWYM behavior pushing to unqualified <dst>
 + push: test that <src> doesn't DWYM if <dst> is unqualified
 + push: add an advice on unqualified <dst> push
 + push: move unqualified refname error into a function
 + push: improve the error shown on unqualified <dst> push
 + i18n: remote.c: mark error(...) messages for translation
 + remote.c: add braces in anticipation of a follow-up change

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2018-11-18

 "git push $there $src:$dst" rejects when $dst is not a fully
 qualified refname and not clear what the end user meant.  The
 codepath has been taught to give a clearer error message, and also
 guess where the push should go by taking the type of the pushed
 object into account (e.g. a tag object would want to go under
 refs/tags/).


* en/fast-export-import (2018-11-17) 11 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-12-28 at a1b09cf515)
 + fast-export: add a --show-original-ids option to show original names
 + fast-import: remove unmaintained duplicate documentation
 + fast-export: add --reference-excluded-parents option
 + fast-export: ensure we export requested refs
 + fast-export: when using paths, avoid corrupt stream with non-existent mark
 + fast-export: move commit rewriting logic into a function for reuse

 + fast-export: use value from correct enum
 + git-fast-export.txt: clarify misleading documentation about rev-list args
 + git-fast-import.txt: fix documentation for --quiet option
 + fast-export: convert sha1 to oid

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2018-11-18

 Small fixes and features for fast-export and fast-import, mostly on
 the fast-export side.


* en/merge-path-collision (2018-12-01) 11 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-12-28 at b50d3eee25)
 + t6036: avoid non-portable "cp -a"

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2018-12-01

 Updates for corner cases in merge-recursive.


* fc/http-version (2018-11-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-12-28 at 56bcbb0fa9)
 + http: add support selecting http version

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2018-11-18

 The "http.version" configuration variable can be used with recent
 enough cURL library to force the version of HTTP used to talk when
 fetching and pushing.


* jk/loose-object-cache (2018-11-24) 10 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-12-28 at 5a5faf384e)
 + odb_load_loose_cache: fix strbuf leak
 + fetch-pack: drop custom loose object cache
 + sha1-file: use loose object cache for quick existence check
 + object-store: provide helpers for loose_objects_cache
 + sha1-file: use an object_directory for the main object dir
 + handle alternates paths the same as the main object dir
 + sha1_file_name(): overwrite buffer instead of appending
 + rename "alternate_object_database" to "object_directory"
 + submodule--helper: prefer strip_suffix() to ends_with()
 + fsck: do not reuse child_process structs

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2018-11-24

 Code clean-up with optimization for the codepath that checks
 (non-)existence of loose objects.


* mk/http-backend-kill-children-before-exit (2018-11-26) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-12-28 at 81188d93c3)
 + http-backend: enable cleaning up forked upload/receive-pack on exit

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2018-11-29

 The http-backend CGI process did not correctly clean up the child
 processes it spawns to run upload-pack etc. when it dies itself,
 which has been corrected.


* nd/checkout-dwim-fix (2018-11-14) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-12-28 at 3183c9305b)
 + checkout: disambiguate dwim tracking branches and local files

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2018-11-18

 "git checkout frotz" (without any double-dash) avoids ambiguity by
 making sure 'frotz' cannot be interpreted as a revision and as a
 path at the same time.  This safety has been updated to check also
 a unique remote-tracking branch 'frotz' in a remote, when dwimming
 to create a local branch 'frotz' out of a remote-tracking branch
 'frotz' from a remote.


* nd/i18n (2018-11-12) 16 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-12-28 at 8e2de8338e)

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2018-11-18

 More codepaths become aware of working with in-core repository
 instance other than the default "the_repository".


* sd/stash-wo-user-name (2018-11-19) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-12-28 at 99197ef5a1)
 + stash: tolerate missing user identity
 (this branch is used by ps/stash-in-c.)

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2018-11-19

 A properly configured username/email is required under
 user.useConfigOnly in order to create commits; now "git stash"
 (even though it creates commit objects to represent stash entries)
 command is exempt from the requirement.


* sg/clone-initial-fetch-configuration (2018-11-16) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-12-28 at 82e104f221)
 + Documentation/clone: document ignored configuration variables
 + clone: respect additional configured fetch refspecs during initial fetch
 + clone: use a more appropriate variable name for the default refspec

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2018-11-18

 Refspecs configured with "git -c var=val clone" did not propagate
 to the resulting repository, which has been corrected.

[New Topics]

* ab/proto-v2-fixes (2018-12-14) 5 commits
 - tests: mark tests broken under GIT_TEST_PROTOCOL_VERSION=2
 - builtin/fetch-pack: support protocol version 2
 - tests: mark & fix tests broken under GIT_TEST_PROTOCOL_VERSION=1
 - tests: add a special setup where for protocol.version
 - tests: add a check for unportable env --unset

 This is (just a part of) v2, and I see v3 posted on the list, but
 it seems that v3 needs further updates.
 cf. <20181218124852.GD30471@sigill.intra.peff.net>

 I'll drop the whole thing and wait for an update.


* jn/stripspace-wo-repository (2018-12-26) 1 commit
 - stripspace: allow -s/-c outside git repository

 "git stripspace" should be usable outside a git repository, but
 under the "-s" or "-c" mode, it didn't.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ma/asciidoctor (2018-12-26) 3 commits
 - git-status.txt: render tables correctly under Asciidoctor
 - Documentation: do not nest open blocks
 - git-column.txt: fix section header

 Some of the documentation pages formatted incorrectly with
 Asciidoctor, which have been fixed.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* nd/worktree-remove-with-uninitialized-submodules (2019-01-07) 1 commit
 - worktree: allow to (re)move worktrees with uninitialized submodules

 "git worktree remove" and "git worktree move" refused to work when
 there is a submodule involved.  This has been loosened to ignore
 uninitialized submodules.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sb/submodule-unset-core-worktree-when-worktree-is-lost (2018-12-26) 4 commits
 - submodule deinit: unset core.worktree
 - submodule--helper: fix BUG message in ensure_core_worktree
 - submodule: unset core.worktree if no working tree is present
 - submodule update: add regression test with old style setups

 The core.worktree setting in a submodule repository should not be
 pointing at a directory when the submodule loses its working tree
 (e.g. getting deinit'ed), but the code did not properly maintain
 this invariant.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* so/cherry-pick-always-allow-m1 (2019-01-07) 4 commits
 - t3506: validate '-m 1 -ff' is now accepted for non-merge commits
 - t3502: validate '-m 1' argument is now accepted for non-merge commits
 - cherry-pick: do not error on non-merge commits when '-m 1' is specified
 - t3510: stop using '-m 1' to force failure mid-sequence of cherry-picks

 "git cherry-pick -m1" was forbidden when picking a non-merge
 commit, even though there _is_ parent number 1 for such a commit.
 This was done to avoid mistakes back when "cherry-pick" was about
 picking a single commit, but is no longer useful with "cherry-pick"
 that can pick a range of commits.  Now the "-m$num" option is
 allowed when picking any commit, as long as $num names an existing
 parent of the commit.

 Technically this is a backward incompatible change; hopefully
 nobody is relying on the error-checking behaviour.

* cy/completion-typofix (2019-01-03) 1 commit
 - completion: fix typo in git-completion.bash

 Typofix.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* cy/zsh-completion-SP-in-path (2019-01-03) 2 commits
 - completion: treat results of git ls-tree as file paths
 - zsh: complete unquoted paths with spaces correctly

 With zsh, "git cmd path<TAB>" was completed to "git cmd path name"
 when the completed path has a special character like SP in it,
 without any attempt to keep "path name" a single filename.  This
 has been fixed to complete it to "git cmd path\ name" just like
 Bash completion does.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ds/commit-graph-assert-missing-parents (2019-01-02) 1 commit
 - commit-graph: writing missing parents is a BUG

 Tightening error checking in commit-graph writer.

 The "strncat()" function is now among the banned functions.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/dev-build-format-security (2019-01-07) 1 commit
 - config.mak.dev: add -Wall, primarily for -Wformat, to help autoconf users

 Earlier we added "-Wformat-security" to developer builds, assuming
 that "-Wall" (which includes "-Wformat" which in turn is required
 to use "-Wformat-security") is always in effect.  This is not true
 when config.mak.autogen is in use, unfortunately.  This has been
 fixed by unconditionally adding "-Wall" to developer builds.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jp/author-committer-config (2019-01-02) 2 commits
 - DONTMERGE
 - Add author and committer configuration settings

 Four new configuration variables {author,committer}.{name,email}
 have been introduced to override user.{name,email} in more specific
 cases.

 Expecting a reroll.

* js/rebase-am (2019-01-03) 4 commits
 - built-in rebase: call `git am` directly
 - rebase: teach `reset_head()` to optionally skip the worktree
 - rebase: avoid double reflog entry when switching branches
 - rebase: move `reset_head()` into a better spot

 Instead of going through "git-rebase--am" scriptlet to use the "am"
 backend, the built-in version of "git rebase" learned to drive the
 "am" backend directly.

 Waiting for a review response.
 Looked almost ready.


* ms/packet-err-check (2019-01-02) 2 commits
 - pack-protocol.txt: accept error packets in any context
 - Use packet_reader instead of packet_read_line

 Error checking of data sent over the pack-protocol has been
 revamped so that error packets are always diagnosed properly.


* os/rebase-runs-post-checkout-hook (2019-01-02) 2 commits
 - rebase: run post-checkout hook on checkout
 - t5403: simplify by using a single repository

 "git rebase" internally runs "checkout" to switch between branches,
 and the command used to call the post-checkout hook, but the
 reimplementation stopped doing so, which is getting fixed.


* rb/hpe (2019-01-03) 5 commits
 - compat/regex/regcomp.c: define intptr_t and uintptr_t on NonStop
 - git-compat-util.h: add FLOSS headers for HPE NonStop
 - config.mak.uname: support for modern HPE NonStop config.
 - transport-helper: drop read/write errno checks
 - transport-helper: use xread instead of read

 Portability updates for the HPE NonStop platform.

* sg/test-bash-version-fix (2019-01-03) 2 commits
 - Merge branch 'sg/test-bash-version-fix'
 - test-lib: check Bash version for '-x' without using shell arrays
 (this branch is used by sg/stress-test.)

 The test suite tried to see if it is run under bash, but the check
 itself failed under some other implementations of shell (notably
 under NetBSD).  This has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.

* lt/date-human (2019-01-02) 3 commits
 - t0006-date.sh: add `human` date format tests.
 - Add 'human' date format documentation
 - Add 'human' date format

 A new date format "--date=human" that morphs its output depending
 on how far the time is from the current time has been introduced.
 "--date=auto" can be used to use this new format when the output is
 goint to the pager or to the terminal and otherwise the default
 format.

 The design around "auto" may need to be rethought.
 The tests need to be updated, too.

 Lines that begin with a certain keyword that come over the wire, as
 well as lines that consist only of one of these keywords, ought to
 be painted in color for easier eyeballing, but the latter was
 broken ever since the feature was introduced in 2.19, which has
 been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* js/commit-graph-chunk-table-fix (2018-12-14) 3 commits
 - Makefile: correct example fuzz build
 - commit-graph: fix buffer read-overflow
 - commit-graph, fuzz: add fuzzer for commit-graph

 The codepath to read from the commit-graph file attempted to read
 past the end of it when the file's table-of-contents was corrupt.


* jt/get-reference-with-commit-graph (2018-12-28) 1 commit
 - revision: use commit graph in get_reference()
 (this branch uses sb/more-repo-in-api; is tangled with md/list-objects-filter-by-depth.)

 Micro-optimize the code that prepares commit objects to be walked
 by "git rev-list" when the commit-graph is available.

 Needs to be rebuilt when sb/more-repo-in-api is rewound.

  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-04 at a713ef389c)
 + log -G: ignore binary files

 "git log -G<regex>" looked for a hunk in the "git log -p" patch
 output that contained a string that matches the given pattern.
 Optimize this code to ignore binary files, which by default will
 not show any hunk that would match any pattern (unless textconv or
 the --text option is in effect, that is).

 Will merge to 'master'.


* dl/merge-cleanup-scissors-fix (2018-11-21) 2 commits
 - merge: add scissors line on merge conflict
 - t7600: clean up 'merge --squash c3 with c7' test

 The list of conflicted paths shown in the editor while concluding a
 conflicted merge was shown above the scissors line when the
 clean-up mode is set to "scissors", even though it was commented
 out just like the list of updated paths and other information to
 help the user explain the merge better.

 Kicked out of 'next', to replace with a newer iteration.

 - pretty: allow showing specific trailers
 - pretty: single return path in %(trailers) handling
 - pretty: allow %(trailers) options with explicit value
 - doc: group pretty-format.txt placeholders descriptions

 The %(trailers) formatter in "git log --format=..."  now allows to
 optionally pick trailers selectively by keyword, show only values,
 etc.

 How's the doneness of this one?


* nd/attr-pathspec-in-tree-walk (2018-11-19) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-04 at 6a07e5b905)

 + pathspec.h: clean up "extern" in function declarations
 + tree-walk.c: make tree_entry_interesting() take an index

 The traversal over tree objects has learned to honor
 ":(attr:label)" pathspec match, which has been implemented only for
 enumerating paths on the filesystem.

 Expecting a reroll.


* nd/checkout-noisy (2018-11-20) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-04 at 480172d3d7)
 + t0027: squelch checkout path run outside test_expect_* block
 + checkout: print something when checking out paths

 "git checkout [<tree-ish>] path..." learned to report the number of
 paths that have been checked out of the index or the tree-ish,
 which gives it the same degree of noisy-ness as the case in which
 the command checks out a branch.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* en/rebase-merge-on-sequencer (2019-01-07) 8 commits
 - rebase: implement --merge via the interactive machinery

 - git-legacy-rebase: simplify unnecessary triply-nested if
 - git-rebase, sequencer: extend --quiet option for the interactive machinery
 - am, rebase--merge: do not overlook --skip'ed commits with post-rewrite
 - t5407: add a test demonstrating how interactive handles --skip differently
 - rebase: fix incompatible options error message
 - rebase: make builtin and legacy script error messages the same

 "git rebase --merge" as been reimplemented by reusing the internal
 machinery used for "git rebase -i".


* dl/remote-save-to-push (2018-12-11) 1 commit
 - remote: add --save-to-push option to git remote set-url

 "git remote set-url" learned a new option that moves existing value
 of the URL field to pushURL field of the remote before replacing
 the URL field with a new value.

 I am personally not yet quite convinced if this is worth pursuing.


* js/protocol-advertise-multi (2018-12-28) 1 commit
 - protocol: advertise multiple supported versions

 The transport layer has been updated so that the protocol version
 used can be negotiated between the parties, by the initiator
 listing the protocol versions it is willing to talk, and the other
 side choosing from one of them.


* js/smart-http-detect-remote-error (2019-01-07) 3 commits
 - remote-curl: die on server-side errors
 - remote-curl: tighten "version 2" check for smart-http

 Some errors from the other side coming over smart HTTP transport
 were not noticed, which has been corrected.


* nb/branch-show-other-worktrees-head (2019-01-07) 4 commits
 - branch: add an extra verbose output displaying worktree path for checked out branch
 - branch: mark and color a branch that is checked out in a linked worktree differently
 - SQUASH???
 - ref-filter: add worktreepath atom

 "git branch --list" learned to show branches that are checked out
 in other worktrees connected to the same repository prefixed with
 '+', similar to the way the currently checked out branch is shown
 with '*' in front.
 

* ot/ref-filter-object-info (2018-12-28) 6 commits
 - ref-filter: add docs for new options
 - ref-filter: add tests for deltabase
 - ref-filter: add deltabase option
 - ref-filter: add tests for objectsize:disk
 - ref-filter: add check for negative file size
 - ref-filter: add objectsize:disk option

 The "--format=<placeholder>" option of for-each-ref, branch and tag
 learned to show a few more traits of objects that can be learned by
 the object_info API.

* md/list-lazy-objects-fix (2018-12-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-04 at 93bd38fff9)
 + list-objects.c: don't segfault for missing cmdline objects

 "git rev-list --exclude-promisor-objects" had to take an object
 that does not exist locally (and is lazily available) from the
 command line without barfing, but the code dereferenced NULL.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 - t: add basic tests for our SHA-1 implementation
 - cache: make hashcmp and hasheq work with larger hashes
 - hex: introduce functions to print arbitrary hashes
 - sha1-file: provide functions to look up hash algorithms
 - sha1-file: rename algorithm to "sha1"

 Add sha-256 hash and plug it through the code to allow building Git

* js/vsts-ci (2018-10-16) 13 commits
 . travis: fix skipping tagged releases
 . README: add a build badge (status of the Azure Pipelines build)
 . tests: record more stderr with --write-junit-xml in case of failure
 . tests: include detailed trace logs with --write-junit-xml upon failure

 . tests: optionally write results as JUnit-style .xml
 . test-date: add a subcommand to measure times in shell scripts
 . ci/lib.sh: encapsulate Travis-specific things
 . ci: rename the library of common functions

 Prepare to run test suite on Azure DevOps.

 Ejected out of 'pu', as doing so seems to help other topics get
 tested at TravisCI.

 https://travis-ci.org/git/git/builds/452713184 is a sample of a
 build whose tests on 4 hang (with this series in).  Ejecting it
 gave us https://travis-ci.org/git/git/builds/452778963 which still
 shows breakages from other topics not yet in 'next', but at least
 the tests do not stall.


* du/branch-show-current (2018-10-26) 1 commit
 - branch: introduce --show-current display option

 "git branch" learned a new subcommand "--show-current".

 I am personally not yet quite convinced if this is worth pursuing.


* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2018-10-15) 1 commit
 - zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".


* ag/sequencer-reduce-rewriting-todo (2018-11-12) 16 commits
 . rebase--interactive: move transform_todo_file() to rebase--interactive.c
 . sequencer: fix a call to error() in transform_todo_file()
 . sequencer: use edit_todo_list() in complete_action()
 . rebase-interactive: rewrite edit_todo_list() to handle the initial edit
 . rebase-interactive: append_todo_help() changes
 . rebase-interactive: use todo_list_write_to_file() in edit_todo_list()
 . sequencer: refactor skip_unnecessary_picks() to work on a todo_list
 . sequencer: change complete_action() to use the refactored functions
 . sequencer: make sequencer_make_script() write its script to a strbuf
 . sequencer: refactor rearrange_squash() to work on a todo_list
 . sequencer: refactor sequencer_add_exec_commands() to work on a todo_list
 . sequencer: refactor check_todo_list() to work on a todo_list
 . sequencer: introduce todo_list_write_to_file()
 . sequencer: refactor transform_todos() to work on a todo_list
 . sequencer: make the todo_list structure public
 . sequencer: changes in parse_insn_buffer()

 The scripted version of "git rebase -i" wrote and rewrote the todo
 list many times during a single step of its operation, and the
 recent C-rewrite made a faithful conversion of the logic to C.  The
 implementation has been updated to carry necessary information
 around in-core to avoid rewriting the same file over and over
 unnecessarily.

 With too many topics in-flight that touch sequencer and rebaser,
 this need to wait giving precedence to other topics that fix bugs.

 - add -p: optimize line selection for short hunks
 - add -p: allow line selection to be inverted
 - add -p: select modified lines correctly
 - add -p: select individual hunk lines

 "git add -p" interactive interface learned to let users choose
 individual added/removed lines to be used in the operation, instead
 of accepting or rejecting a whole hunk.

 Will discard.
 No further feedbacks on the topic for quite some time.

 cf. <d622a95b-7302-43d4-4ec9-b2cf3388c653@talktalk.net>

 The original implementation of "git archive --remote" more or less

 well as Git native transport.
