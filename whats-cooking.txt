What's cooking in git.git (Mar 2016, #01; Wed, 2)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

v2.8-rc1 at around the end of this week.

Again, the topics that have not been cooked sufficiently in 'next'
at this point will not be considered for 2.8 final, even though I
might later succumb to the temptation to pick up ones that look
trivially correct.  Those who have their topics merged to 'master'
since v2.7 are expected to focus on responding to regressions and
remaining bugs in their topics in 'master', and strongly encouraged
to actively hunt for regressions and remaining bugs there, not in a
random shiny new feature, during the pre-release period.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches of the
repositories listed at

 + run-command: do not pass child process data into callbacks
 (this branch is used by sb/submodule-init and sb/submodule-parallel-update.)

 Simplify the two callback functions that are triggered when the
 child process terminates to avoid misuse of the child-process
 structure that has already been cleaned up.

 Will merge to 'master' by 2.8-rc1


* ss/exc-flag-is-a-collection-of-bits (2016-03-01) 1 commit
 - dir: store EXC_FLAG_* values in unsigned integers

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jc/bundle (2016-03-02) 4 commits
 - bundle v3: the beginning
 - bundle: keep a copy of bundle file name in the in-core bundle header
 - bundle: plug resource leak
 - bundle doc: 'verify' is not about verifying the bundle

 The beginning of "split bundle", which could be one of the
 ingredients to allow "git clone" traffic off of the core server
 network to CDN.

 Usability fix for annotate-specific "<file> <rev>" syntax with deleted
 files.

 Waiting for review.


* dg/subtree-rebase-test (2016-01-19) 1 commit
 - contrib/subtree: Add a test for subtree rebase that loses commits

 Reviewed up to v5.
 Will be rerolled.
 ($gmane/284426)


* js/am-3-merge-recursive-direct (2015-10-12) 2 commits
 - am: make a direct call to merge_recursive
 - merge_recursive_options: introduce the "gently" flag

 The merge_recursive_generic() function has been made a bit safer to
 call from inside a process.  "git am -3" was taught to make a direct
 call to the function when falling back to three-way merge.

 Being able to make a direct call would be good in general, but as a
 performance thing, the change needs to be backed up by numbers.

 Needs review.

 I haven't gone through the "gently" change with fine toothed comb;
 I can see that the change avoids calling die(), but I haven't made
 sure that the program states (e.g. what's in the in-core index) are
 adjusted sensibly when it returns to the caller instead of dying,
 or the codepaths that used to die() are free of resource leaks.
 The original code certainly did not care the program states at the
 point of dying exactly because it knew it is going to exit, but now
 they have to care, and they need to be audited.


* dk/gc-more-wo-pack (2016-01-13) 4 commits
 - gc: clean garbage .bitmap files from pack dir
 - t5304: ensure non-garbage files are not deleted
 - t5304: test .bitmap garbage files
 - prepare_packed_git(): find more garbage

 Follow-on to dk/gc-idx-wo-pack topic, to clean up stale
 .bitmap and .keep files.

 Waiting for a reroll.
 ($gmane/284368).


* jc/diff-b-m (2015-02-23) 5 commits
 . WIPWIP
 . WIP: diff-b-m
 - diffcore-rename: allow easier debugging
 - diffcore-rename.c: add locate_rename_src()
 - diffcore-break: allow debugging

 "git diff -B -M" produced incorrect patch when the postimage of a
 completely rewritten file is similar to the preimage of a removed
 file; such a resulting file must not be expressed as a rename from
 other place.

 The fix in this patch is broken, unfortunately.
 Will discard.

* jk/credential-clear-config (2016-02-26) 1 commit
 - credential: let empty credential specs reset helper list

 The credential.helper configuration variable is cumulative and
 there is no good way to override it from the command line.  As
 a special case, giving an empty string as its value now serves
 as the signal to clear the values specified in various files.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/submodule-c-credential (2016-03-01) 6 commits
 - git: submodule honor -c credential.* from command line
 - quote: implement sq_quotef()
 - submodule: fix segmentation fault in submodule--helper clone
 - submodule: fix submodule--helper clone usage
 - submodule: check argc count for git submodule--helper clone
 - submodule: don't pass empty string arguments to submodule--helper clone
 (this branch uses mg/httpd-tests-update-for-apache-2.4.)

 "git -c credential.<var>=<value> submodule" can now be used to
 propagate configuration variables related to credential helper
 down to the submodules.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* mg/httpd-tests-update-for-apache-2.4 (2016-02-25) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-03-01 at d2f7e8c)
 + t/lib-httpd: load mod_unixd
 (this branch is used by jk/submodule-c-credential.)

 The way the test scripts configure the Apache web server has been
 updated to work also for Apache 2.4 running on RedHat derived
 distros.

 Will merge to 'master' by 2.8-rc1


* nd/shallow-deepen (2016-02-23) 25 commits
 - fetch, upload-pack: --deepen=N extends shallow boundary by N commits
 - upload-pack: add get_reachable_list()
 - upload-pack: split check_unreachable() in two, prep for get_reachable_list()
 - t5500, t5539: tests for shallow depth excluding a ref
 - clone: define shallow clone boundary with --shallow-exclude
 - fetch: define shallow boundary with --shallow-exclude
 - upload-pack: support define shallow boundary by excluding revisions
 - refs: add expand_ref()
 - t5500, t5539: tests for shallow depth since a specific date
 - clone: define shallow clone boundary based on time with --shallow-since
 - fetch: define shallow boundary with --shallow-since
 - upload-pack: add deepen-since to cut shallow repos based on time
 - shallow.c: implement a generic shallow boundary finder based on rev-list
 - fetch-pack: use a separate flag for fetch in deepening mode
 - fetch-pack: use a common function for verbose printing
 - fetch-pack: use skip_prefix() instead of starts_with()
 - upload-pack: move rev-list code out of check_non_tip()
 - upload-pack: tighten number parsing at "deepen" lines
 - upload-pack: use skip_prefix() instead of starts_with()
 - upload-pack: move "unshallow" sending code out of deepen()
 - upload-pack: remove unused variable "backup"
 - upload-pack: move "shallow" sending code out of deepen()
 - upload-pack: move shallow deepen code out of receive_needs()
 - transport-helper.c: refactor set_helper_option()
 - remote-curl.c: convert fetch_git() to use argv_array

 The existing "git fetch --depth=<n>" option was hard to use
 correctly when making the history of an existing shallow clone
 deeper.  A new option, "--deepen=<n>", has been added to make this
 easier to use.  "git clone" also learned "--shallow-since=<date>"
 and "--shallow-exclude=<tag>" options to make it easier to specify
 "I am interested only in the recent N months worth of history" and
 "Give me only the history since that version".

 Needs review.


* jk/pack-idx-corruption-safety (2016-02-27) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-03-01 at 49e08d3)
 + sha1_file.c: mark strings for translation
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-02-26 at ef0d6de)
 + use_pack: handle signed off_t overflow
 + nth_packed_object_offset: bounds-check extended offset
 + t5313: test bounds-checks of corrupted/malicious pack/idx files

 The code to read the pack data using the offsets stored in the pack
 idx file has been made more carefully check the validity of the
 data in the idx.

 Will merge to 'master' by 2.8-rc1


* mm/diff-renames-default (2016-02-25) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-02-25 at 947c399)
 + diff: activate diff.renames by default
 + log: introduce init_log_defaults()
 + t: add tests for diff.renames (true/false/unset)
 + t4001-diff-rename: wrap file creations in a test
 + Documentation/diff-config: fix description of diff.renames

 The end-user facing Porcelain level commands like "diff" and "log"
 now enables the rename detection by default.

 Will merge to 'master' after 2.8 final


* mp/upload-pack-use-embedded-args (2016-02-25) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-02-26 at f0a54e5)
 + upload-pack: use argv_array for pack_objects

 The embedded args argv-array in the child process is used to build
 the command line to run pack-objects instead of using a separate
 array of strings.

 Will merge to 'master' after 2.8 final


* sb/submodule-init (2016-03-01) 2 commits
 - submodule: port init from shell to C
 - submodule: port resolve_relative_url from shell to C
 (this branch uses sb/submodule-parallel-fetch and sb/submodule-parallel-update.)

 Update of "git submodule" to move pieces of logic to C continues.

 Needs review.


* az/p4-bare-no-rebase (2016-02-19) 1 commit
 - git-p4.py: Don't try to rebase on submit from bare repository

 "git p4 submit" attempts to do a rebase, which would fail if done
 in a bare repository.  Not doing this rebase would paper over the
 failure, which is what this patch does, but it is unclear what the
 side effect of not rebasing is.

 Needs a better explanation.


* cn/deprecate-ssh-git-url (2016-02-15) 1 commit
 - Disown ssh+git and git+ssh

 Needs toning down by replacing the condescendence with an
 explanation and enlightenment.
 ($gmane/286222)


* ss/commit-dry-run-resolve-merge-to-no-op (2016-02-17) 1 commit
 - wt-status.c: set commitable bit if there is a meaningful merge.

 "git commit --dry-run" reported "No, no, you cannot commit." in one
 case where "git commit" would have allowed you to commit, and this
 improves it a little bit ("git commit --dry-run --short" still does
 not give you the correct answer, for example).


* nd/icase (2016-02-15) 12 commits
 - grep.c: reuse "icase" variable
 - diffcore-pickaxe: support case insensitive match on non-ascii
 - diffcore-pickaxe: "share" regex error handling code
 - grep/pcre: support utf-8
 - gettext: add is_utf8_locale()
 - grep/pcre: prepare locale-dependent tables for icase matching
 - grep/icase: avoid kwsset when -F is specified
 - grep/icase: avoid kwsset on literal non-ascii strings
 - test-regex: expose full regcomp() to the command line
 - test-regex: isolate the bug test code
 - grep: break down an "if" stmt in preparation for next changes
 - grep: allow -F -i combination

 "git grep -i" has been taught to fold case in non-ascii locales.

 Needs review.
 ($gmane/286137)


* sb/submodule-parallel-update (2016-03-01) 10 commits
 - clone: allow an explicit argument for parallel submodule clones
 - submodule update: expose parallelism to the user
 - submodule helper: remove double 'fatal: ' prefix
 - git submodule update: have a dedicated helper for cloning
 - run_processes_parallel: rename parameters for the callbacks
 - run_processes_parallel: treat output of children as byte array
 - submodule update: direct error message to stderr
 - fetching submodules: respect `submodule.fetchJobs` config option
 - submodule-config: drop check against NULL
 - submodule-config: keep update strategy around
 (this branch is used by sb/submodule-init; uses sb/submodule-parallel-fetch.)

 A major part of "git submodule update" has been ported to C to take
 advantage of the recently added framework to run download tasks in
 parallel.

 Will merge to 'next'.

* ad/cygwin-wants-rename (2015-08-07) 1 commit
 - config.mak.uname: Cygwin needs OBJECT_CREATION_USES_RENAMES

 Will hold.
 ($gmane/275680).

 - rerere: do use multiple variants
 - t4200: rerere a merge with two identical conflicts
 - rerere: allow multiple variants to exist
 - rerere: delay the recording of preimage
 - rerere: handle leftover rr-cache/$ID directory and postimage files
 - rerere: scan $GIT_DIR/rr-cache/$ID when instantiating a rerere_id
 - rerere: split conflict ID further

 "git rerere" can encounter two or more files with the same conflict
 signature that have to be resolved in different ways, but there was
 no way to record these separate resolutions.

 Needs further work on forget/gc.


* jc/merge-drop-old-syntax (2015-04-29) 1 commit
 - merge: drop 'git merge <message> HEAD <commit>' syntax

 Stop supporting "git merge <message> HEAD <commit>" syntax that has
 been deprecated since October 2007.  It has been reported that
 git-gui still uses the deprecated syntax, which needs to be fixed
 before this final step can proceed.
