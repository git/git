What's cooking in git.git (Jun 2021, #01; Wed, 2)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen' (which collects random set of
topics that are not yet in 'next') while commits prefixed with '+'
are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of the
integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

Hopefully the last release candidate for this cycle, -rc3, has been
tagged.  A big thank-you to those who gave us the last minute fixes.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

Release tarballs are available at:

 "git p4" in Python-2 days used to accept a lot more kinds of data

  (merged to 'next' on 2021-05-16 at 48fd717185)
 + ref-filter: introduce enum atom_type
 + ref-filter: add objectsize to used_atom

 The code to handle the "--format" option in "for-each-ref" and

 format string, which has been corrected by converting them into
 enum when the format string is parsed.

  (merged to 'next' on 2021-05-22 at 755df67f0e)
 + git-send-email: add option to specify sendmail command

 "git send-email" learned the "--sendmail-cmd" command line option
 and the "sendemail.sendmailCmd" configuration variable, which is a
 more sensible approach than the current way of repurposing the
 "smtp-server" that is meant to name the server to instead name the
 command to talk to the server.

  (merged to 'next' on 2021-05-28 at 2733ec2409)
 + diff-merges: let "-m" imply "-p"
 + diff-merges: rename "combined_imply_patch" to "merges_imply_patch"
 + stash list: stop passing "-m" to "git log"
 + git-svn: stop passing "-m" to "git rev-list"
 + diff-merges: move specific diff-index "-m" handling to diff-index
 + t4013: test "git diff-index -m"
 + t4013: test "git diff-tree -m"
 + t4013: test "git log -m --stat"
 + t4013: test "git log -m --raw"
 + t4013: test that "-m" alone has no effect in "git log"

 The "-m" option in "git log -m" that does not specify which format,
 if any, of diff is desired did not have any visible effect; it now
 implies some form of diff (by default "--patch") is produced.

 "git fsck" has been taught to report mismatch between expected and
 actual types of an object better.

 Seems to break tests when merged to 'seen'.
