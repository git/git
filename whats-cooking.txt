What's cooking in git.git (Mar 2009, #03; Wed, 11)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones
marked with '.' do not appear in any of the branches, but I am still
holding onto them.

The topics list the commits in reverse chronological order.  The topics
meant to be merged to the maintenance series have "maint-" in their names.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* db/maint-missing-origin (Wed Mar 11 01:47:20 2009 -0400) 1 commit
 - Give error when no remote is configured

* js/sideband-stderr (Tue Mar 10 22:58:09 2009 +0100) 2 commits
 - winansi: support ESC [ K (erase in line)
 - recv_sideband: Bands #2 and #3 always go to stderr

 - rsync transport: allow local paths, and fix tests

* rs/color-grep (Sun Mar 8 18:22:44 2009 -0700) 6 commits
 + grep: cast printf %.*s "precision" argument explicitly to int
 + grep: add support for coloring with external greps
 + grep: color patterns in output
 + grep: add pmatch and eflags arguments to match_one_pattern()
 + grep: remove grep_opt argument from match_expr_eval()
 + grep: micro-optimize hit collection for AND nodes

 + Support '*' in the middle of a refspec
 + Keep '*' in pattern refspecs
 + Use the matching function to generate the match results
 + Use a single function to match names against patterns
 + Make clone parse the default refspec with the normal code

* db/push-cleanup (Sun Mar 8 21:06:07 2009 -0400) 2 commits
 - Move push matching and reporting logic into transport.c

With the topmost three patches, tonight's 'pu' does not pass the self test
as expected.  I am not sure there is a wide support for changing the
default, either.

suite; this one has them fixed.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Stalled and may need help and prodding to go forward]

* lh/submodule-tree-traversal (Sun Jan 25 01:52:06 2009 +0100) 1 commit
 - archive.c: add support for --submodules[=(all|checkedout)]

Discussion stalled on the submodule selection criteria.

* jc/merge-convert (Mon Jan 26 16:45:01 2009 -0800) 1 commit
 - git-merge-file: allow converting the results for the work tree

This is a feature waiting for a user.

We did not give scripted Porcelains a way to say "this temporary file I am
using for merging is for this path, so use the core.autocrlf and attributes
rules for that final path".  Instead, merge-file simply wrote out the
data in the canonical repository representation.

rerere has the same issue, but it is a lot worse.  It reads the three
files (preimage, postimage and thisimage) from the work tree in the work
tree representation, merges them without converting them to the canonical
representation first but inserts the conflict markers with the canonical
representation and writes the resulting mess out.  It needs to be fixed to
read with convert_to_git(), merge them while they are still in the
canonical representation and possibly add conflict markers, and then write
the results out after convert_to_working_tree().  It also needs to write
in binary mode as well.

* db/foreign-scm (Sun Jan 11 15:12:10 2009 -0500) 3 commits
 - Support fetching from foreign VCSes
 - Add specification of git-vcs helpers
 - Add "vcs" config option in remotes

The "spec" did not seem quite well cooked yet, but in the longer term I
think something like this to allow interoperating with other SCMs as if
the other end is a native git repository is a very worthy goal.

* cc/replace (Mon Feb 2 06:13:06 2009 +0100) 11 commits
 - builtin-replace: use "usage_msg_opt" to give better error messages
 - parse-options: add new function "usage_msg_opt"
 - builtin-replace: teach "git replace" to actually replace
 - Add new "git replace" command
 - environment: add global variable to disable replacement
 - mktag: call "check_sha1_signature" with the replacement sha1
 - replace_object: add a test case
 - object: call "check_sha1_signature" with the replacement sha1
 - sha1_file: add a "read_sha1_file_repl" function
 - replace_object: add mechanism to replace objects found in
   "refs/replace/"
 - refs: add a "for_each_replace_ref" function

I think the code is much cleaner than the first round, but I am not
convinced it is doing the right thing in the connectivity traverser.
Independent review sorely needed.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Discarded]

* sc/gitweb-category (Fri Dec 12 00:45:12 2008 +0100) 3 commits
 . gitweb: Optional grouping of projects by category
 . gitweb: Split git_project_list_body in two functions
 . gitweb: Modularized git_get_project_description to be more generic

Design discussion between Jakub and Sebastien seems to have stalled, but
Jakub seems to be taking this over.

* jc/push-to-create (Mon Mar 2 22:36:16 2009 -0800) 1 commit
 . Push to create

This was a failed weatherbaloon patch to allow creation of a new
repository from the remote side.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Actively cooking]

Yet more tests without fixing anything...

* jc/clone-branch-rebase (Tue Mar 10 01:20:42 2009 -0700) 2 commits
 + Improve "git branch --tracking" output

This is a rewrite of a patch from Pat Notz.

* kb/tracking-count-no-merges (Wed Mar 4 18:47:39 2009 +0100) 1 commit
 + stat_tracking_info(): only count real commits

This gives the merge commits zero weight when talking about how many
commits you have ahead (or behind) of the branch you are tracking.  Even
though I agree that they should carry much less weight than the "real"
commits, because your repeated merge from the other branch does not really
add any real value to the end result, giving them absolute zero weight
somehow feels wrong. At least it shows that your have been _active_ on the
branch.  But I do not feel very strongly about it.

* js/rebase-i-opt (Tue Mar 3 10:55:31 2009 +0100) 1 commit

 + lstat_cache(): swap func(length, string) into func(string, length)
 + lstat_cache(): generalise longest_match_lstat_cache()
 + lstat_cache(): small cleanup and optimisation

* mv/parseopt-ls-files (Sat Mar 7 20:27:22 2009 -0500) 4 commits
 + ls-files: fix broken --no-empty-directory
 + t3000: use test_cmp instead of diff

   push

These are for 1.7.0, but the messages when they trigger together may need
to be rethought.

 - git commit: pathspec without -i/-o implies -i semantics during a

This was only meant as a weatherballoon to help facilitate discussion.
Will be discarded.
