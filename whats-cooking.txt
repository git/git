What's cooking in git.git (Mar 2010, #03; Wed, 10)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones
marked with '.' do not appear in any of the integration branches, but I am
still holding onto them.

Let's start quieting things down on 'next' front.

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* sh/am-keep-cr (2010-02-27) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-03-02 at ffe3c5e)
 + git-am: Add tests for `--keep-cr`, `--no-keep-cr` and `am.keepcr`
 + git-am: Add am.keepcr and --no-keep-cr to override it
 + git-am: Add command line parameter `--keep-cr` passing it to git-mailsplit
 + documentation: 'git-mailsplit --keep-cr' is not hidden anymore

* sd/init-template (2010-03-02) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-03-02 at 2d87e3f)
 + wrap-for-bin: do not export an empty GIT_TEMPLATE_DIR
 + t/t0001-init.sh: add test for 'init with init.templatedir set'
 + init: having keywords without value is not a global error.
 + Add a "TEMPLATE DIRECTORY" section to git-init[1].
 + Add `init.templatedir` configuration variable.

* lt/deepen-builtin-source (2010-02-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-02-25 at 320aa74)
 + Move 'builtin-*' into a 'builtin/' subdirectory
 (this branch is used by nd/setup.)

* cp/add-u-pathspec (2010-02-09) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-02-24 at 2f3f2bc)
 + test for add with non-existent pathspec
 + git add -u: die on unmatched pathspec

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* js/rebase-origin-x (2010-02-05) 1 commit
 - [RFC w/o test and incomplete] rebase: add -x option to record original commit name

I retract my objection against the idea of -x; needs polishing before
moving forward.

* sd/log-decorate (2010-02-17) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-03-08 at 58a6fba)
 + log.decorate: usability fixes
 + Add `log.decorate' configuration variable.
 + git_config_maybe_bool()

Needs squelching the configuration setting when "--pretty=raw" is given,
at least, or possibly when any "--pretty" is explicitly given.

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* pb/log-first-parent-p-m (2010-03-09) 5 commits
 - show --first-parent/-m: do not default to --cc
 - show -c: show patch text

  (merged to 'next' on 2010-02-17 at 2f8e5ae)
 + git log -p -m: document -m and honor --first-parent

I said 'We might want to teach "-m trumps implicit --cc" to "git show"',
and that is what I did near the tip.  Comments?

* jl/submodule-diff-dirtiness (2010-03-08) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-03-08 at 33f7a57)
 + git status: Show detailed dirty status of submodules in long format
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-03-04 at 58b2645)

 + Documentation: describe new cherry-pick --ff option

* js/async-thread (2010-03-09) 7 commits
 - Enable threaded async procedures whenever pthreads is available

 - Windows: more pthreads functions
 - Fix signature of fcntl() compatibility dummy
 - Make report() from usage.c public as vreportf() and use it.
 - Modernize t5530-upload-pack-error.

The last one is probably unsafe for 'next' until somebody goes and vets
the callees that are invoked via this interface (any possible breakages
are already inflicted on Windows people, though).

 - index-pack: use RUN_SETUP_GENTLY

* jc/maint-add-ignored-dir (2010-02-28) 3 commits

 + builtin-add: fix exclude handling
 + tests for "git add ignored-dir/file" without -f
 + t0050: mark non-working test as such

Jeff came up with a simpler fix than the one at the tip, and we may want
to replace it with his, and possibly teach globbing to the logic later.

 - git submodule summary: Handle HEAD as argument when on an unborn branch
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-03-08 at 0697bf4)

There are still more fix-ups comming?

 . test-lib.sh: Add explicit license detail, with change from GPLv2 to GPLv2+.

it from there without my keeping an eye on it.
