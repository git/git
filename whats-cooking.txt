What's cooking in git.git (Oct 2011, #05; Fri, 14)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.

The second and third wave of topics have graduated to 'master'.

Here are the repositories that have my integration branches:

With maint, master, next, pu, todo, html and man:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git
	https://code.google.com/p/git-core/
	https://github.com/git/git

With only maint, master, html and man:

	git://git.sourceforge.jp/gitroot/git-core/git.git
	git://git-core.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/git-core/git-core

With all the topics and integration branches but not todo, html or man:

[New Topics]

* jk/config-test-cleanup (2011-10-12) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-10-12 at 7c857dd)
 + t1300: test mixed-case variable retrieval
 + t1300: put git invocations inside test function

Will merge to 'master' in the fourth wave.

* jm/maint-apply-detects-corrupt-patch-header (2011-10-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-10-12 at 80d9503)
 + fix "git apply --index ..." not to deref NULL

Will merge to 'master' in the fifth wave.

* mh/ref-api (2011-10-12) 7 commits
 - clear_cached_refs(): inline function
 - write_ref_sha1(): only invalidate the loose ref cache
 - clear_cached_refs(): extract two new functions
 - clear_cached_refs(): rename parameter
 - invalidate_ref_cache(): expose this function in refs API
 - invalidate_ref_cache(): take the submodule as parameter
 - invalidate_ref_cache(): rename function from invalidate_cached_refs()

The first rename felt somewhat inconsistent in that it reworded the object
of one particular verb "invalidate" to "ref_cache" but otherwise that
entity is left as "cached_refs" throughout the codebase.

The updated series looked almost all trivial and sensible but they would
depend on this renaming, so I haven't queued them here yet. Personally I
think we should either not rename just the function name (i.e. drop the
first patch in this series) or rename both the function and what it
operates on (i.e. enhance the first patch in this series).

* bk/submodule-in-recursive-merge (2011-10-13) 2 commits

Re-roll expected.

* jc/unseekable-bundle (2011-10-13) 2 commits
 - bundle: add parse_bundle_header() helper function

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* hv/submodule-merge-search (2011-10-13) 4 commits
 - submodule.c: make two functions static
 - allow multiple calls to submodule merge search for the same path
 - push: Don't push a repository with unpushed submodules
 - push: teach --recurse-submodules the on-demand option

What the topic aims to achieve may make sense, but the implementation
looked somewhat suboptimal.

The fix-up at the tip queued on fg/submodule-auto-push topic has been
moved to this topic.

* sr/transport-helper-fix-rfc (2011-07-19) 2 commits
 - t5800: point out that deleting branches does not work
 - t5800: document inability to push new branch with old content

Perhaps 281eee4 (revision: keep track of the end-user input from the
command line, 2011-08-25) would help.

* cn/fetch-prune (2011-10-07) 4 commits
 - fetch: treat --tags like refs/tags/*:refs/tags/* when pruning
 - fetch: honor the user-provided refspecs when pruning refs
 - t5510: add tests for fetch --prune
 - fetch: free all the additional refspecs

Probably needs a little bit more polish to reduce code duplication between
existing remote_find_tracking() and new find_in_refs().

* jn/gitweb-manpages (2011-10-10) 6 commits
 . gitweb: Add gitweb manpages to 'gitweb' package in git.spec
 . Documentation: Add gitweb config variables to git-config(1)
 . Documentation: Link to gitweb(1) and gitweb.conf(5) in other manpages
 . gitweb: Add manpage for gitweb
 . gitweb: Add manpage for gitweb configuration files
 . Documentation: Preparation for gitweb manpages

A re-roll already being discussed.

* rr/revert-cherry-pick (2011-10-12) 7 commits
 - revert: further simplify parsing of a line in insn sheet
 - revert: Simplify passing command-line arguments around
 - revert: Allow mixed pick and revert instructions
 - revert: Make commit descriptions in insn sheet optional
 - revert: Fix buffer overflow in insn sheet parser
 - revert: Simplify getting commit subject
 - revert: Free memory after get_message call

Probably needs a little bit more polish, e.g. squashing the tip fixup into
an earlier one in the series.

* jc/signed-commit (2011-10-05) 4 commits
 - commit: teach --gpg-sign option
 - Split GPG interface into its own helper library
 - rename "match_refs()" to "match_push_refs()"
 - send-pack: typofix error message

This is to replace the earlier "signed push" experiments. "verify-tag"
equivalent needs to be written before this can proceed. I suspect that
teaching "verify-tag" to notice and also handle signed commits would be
the easiest, but "git tag --verify $commit" might look slightly funny
from the UI POV. I dunno.

* jc/lookup-object-hash (2011-08-11) 6 commits
 - object hash: replace linear probing with 4-way cuckoo hashing
 - object hash: we know the table size is a power of two
 - object hash: next_size() helper for readability
 - pack-objects --count-only
 - object.c: remove duplicated code for object hashing
 - object.c: code movement for readability

I do not think there is anything fundamentally wrong with this series, but
the risk of breakage far outweighs observed performance gain in one
particular workload.

 - Restrict ref-like names immediately below $GIT_DIR
 - refs.c: move dwim_ref()/dwim_log() from sha1_name.c

An attempt to fix-up unfortunate side effect of mh/check-ref-format-3
topic. "git show -s config" is never meant to refer to $GIT_DIR/config
and treat it as a file that records an object name.
