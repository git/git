What's cooking in git.git (Apr 2010, #05; Wed, 14)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones
marked with '.' do not appear in any of the integration branches, but I am
still holding onto them.

We are at 1.7.1-rc1; please test 'master', report & fix regressions.
Hopefully we can do another rc during the next week and release the final
one next weekend.

[Graduated to "master"]

* jc/doc-submit-gmail (2010-04-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-10 at cd4e8cf)
 + SubmittingPatches: update GMail section

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

 - reflog: ignore expire-unreachable for "HEAD" reflog
 - more war on "sleep" in tests

* cw/maint-exec-defpath (2010-04-13) 1 commit
 - exec_cmd.c: replace hard-coded path list with one from <paths.h>

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* rr/remote-helper-doc (2010-04-07) 3 commits

* js/rebase-origin-x (2010-02-05) 1 commit
 - [RFC w/o test and incomplete] rebase: add -x option to record original commit name

I retract my objection against the idea of -x; needs polishing before
moving forward.

* js/grep-open (2010-03-26) 2 commits
 - grep -O: allow optional argument specifying the pager (or editor)
 - grep: Add the option '--open-files-in-pager'
 (this branch is used by jp/hold-string-list-sanity.)

Probably needs to support --no-index mode as well.

* jp/hold-string-list-sanity (2010-04-06) 9 commits
 . string_list: Fix argument order for string_list_append
 . Merge branch 'sr/remote-helper-export' into HEAD
 . Merge branch 'js/grep-open' into HEAD
 . Merge branch 'sb/fmt-merge-msg' into HEAD
 . string_list: Fix argument order for string_list_lookup
 . string_list: Fix argument order for string_list_insert_at_index

 . string_list: Fix argument order for for_each_string_list
 . string_list: Fix argument order for print_string_list
 (this branch uses js/grep-open and sr/remote-helper-export.)

Building this on top of slushy codebase is not a very promising endeavor.
Good thing to do, but bad timing.

[Cooking]

* tr/word-diff (2010-04-14) 1 commit
 - diff: add --word-diff option that generalizes --color-words

There are gitk patches that go with this series.

* sp/maint-describe-tiebreak-with-tagger-date (2010-04-12) 5 commits
 - describe: Break annotated tag ties by tagger date
 - tag.c: Parse tagger date (if present)
 - tag.c: Refactor parse_tag_buffer to be saner to program
 - tag.h: Remove unused signature field

  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-14 at a393c0b)
 + apply: Allow blank *trailing* context lines to match beyond EOF

* bg/send-email-smtpdomain (2010-04-10) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-14 at 88fff99)
 + send-email: Cleanup smtp-domain and add config
 + Document send-email --smtp-domain
 + send-email: Don't use FQDNs without a '.'

* rc/ls-remote-default (2010-04-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-14 at d5081bd)
 + ls-remote: fall-back to default remotes when no remote specified

* rc/maint-curl-helper (2010-04-08) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-14 at 2eb9177)
 + remote-curl: ensure that URLs have a trailing slash
 + http: make end_url_with_slash() public
 + t5541-http-push: add test for URLs with trailing slash

* hg/maint-attr-fix (2010-04-06) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-14 at a27c7d7)
 + attr: Expand macros immediately when encountered.
 + attr: Allow multiple changes to an attribute on the same line.
 + attr: Fixed debug output for macro expansion.

* jc/status-show-ignored (2010-04-10) 5 commits
 - status: --ignored option shows ignored files
 - wt-status: rename and restructure status-print-untracked
 - wt-status: collect ignored files
 - wt-status: plug memory leak while collecting untracked files
 - wt-status: remove unused workdir_untracked member

This is merely an illustration patch.  I am negative about conflating the
JSON output to the mix at this point.  If we are going to add JSON option
to everywhere we would generate "machine readable" output with the -z
and/or --porcelain options, that is fine, but let's stabilize "status"
with the existing --porcelain/-z option first.

* eb/unpretty-b-format (2010-03-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-07 at 7f5c112)
 + Add `%B' in format strings for raw commit body in `git log' and friends

  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-07 at 701e863)
 + Add option to git-commit to allow empty log messages

* jc/test-sleepless (2010-04-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-07 at 8ccf40a)
 + war on "sleep" in tests

* jc/maint-reflog-expire-unreachable (2010-04-07) 1 commit
 - reflog --expire-unreachable: avoid merge-base computation
 (this branch is used by jc/maint-no-reflog-expire-unreach-for-head.)

* np/malloc-threading (2010-04-08) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-10 at e1730fb)
 + Thread-safe xmalloc and xrealloc needs a recursive mutex
 + Make xmalloc and xrealloc thread-safe

The fix should eventually go to 'maint' and 'master'.  This queues the one
from J6t for Windows compatibility.

* js/async-thread (2010-03-09) 7 commits
 - Enable threaded async procedures whenever pthreads is available
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-03-20 at 9939243)
 + Dying in an async procedure should only exit the thread, not the process.
 + Reimplement async procedures using pthreads
 + Windows: more pthreads functions
 + Fix signature of fcntl() compatibility dummy
 + Make report() from usage.c public as vreportf() and use it.

Been waiting for resolution of locking issues in malloc-threading.

  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-06 at 992c9ad)

 + log.decorate: usability fixes
 + Add `log.decorate' configuration variable.
 + git_config_maybe_bool()

* mh/status-optionally-refresh (2010-04-03) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-05 at 0e64aac)
 + t7508: add a test for "git status" in a read-only repository
 + git status: refresh the index if possible
 + t7508: add test for "git status" refreshing the index

* cw/ws-indent-with-tab (2010-04-03) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-05 at 5b5e579)
 + whitespace: tests for git-apply --whitespace=fix with tab-in-indent
 + whitespace: add tab-in-indent support for --whitespace=fix
 + whitespace: replumb ws_fix_copy to take a strbuf *dst instead of char *dst

 + remote-helpers: allow requesing the path to the .git directory
 + fast-import: always create marks_file directories
 + clone: also configure url for bare clones
 + clone: pass the remote name to remote_get
 (this branch is used by jp/hold-string-list-sanity.)

* cc/revert-strategy (2010-03-31) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-05 at 50909c1)
 + revert: add "--strategy" option to choose merge strategy
 + merge: make function try_merge_command non static
 + merge: refactor code that calls "git merge-STRATEGY"
 + revert: refactor merge recursive code into its own function
 + revert: use strbuf to refactor the code that writes the merge message

This is more about debugging and we are not in a great hurry.

* sc/http-late-auth (2010-04-01) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-02 at c991acf)
 + Prompt for a username when an HTTP request 401s

 + diff: avoid useless filespec population
 + diff: cache textconv output
 + textconv: refactor calls to run_textconv
 + introduce notes-cache interface
 + make commit_tree a library function

The small leak fixes in the beginning of the series has been merged to
'master' after a minor fixup.

* ld/discovery-limit-to-fs (2010-04-04) 6 commits
 - write-index: check and warn when worktree crosses a filesystem boundary
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-07 at 11ea09a)
 + Rename ONE_FILESYSTEM to DISCOVERY_ACROSS_FILESYSTEM
 + GIT_ONE_FILESYSTEM: flip the default to stop at filesystem boundaries
 + Add support for GIT_ONE_FILESYSTEM
 + truncate cwd string before printing error message
 + config.c: remove static keyword from git_env_bool()

The tip one is a bit iffy; the whole series changes behaviour in a corner
case, and is not a 1.7.1 material.

* pc/remove-warn (2010-03-26) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-02 at 52fc00d)
 + Remove a redundant errno test in a usage of remove_path
 + Introduce remove_or_warn function
 + Implement the rmdir_or_warn function
 + Generalise the unlink_or_warn function

I cherry-picked only obviously sensible bits.

* em/checkout-orphan (2010-03-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-03-28 at 86b6a4f)
 + git checkout: create unparented branch by --orphan

Perhaps needs a bit of documentation updates, describing the "going open
source" scenario.

* ar/config-from-command-line (2010-03-26) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-07 at e50fd3a)
 + Use strbufs instead of open-coded string manipulation
 + Allow passing of configuration parameters in the command line

* ne/rev-cache (2010-04-05) 7 commits
 . graft awareness
 . object name support
 . integration into revision walker
 . administrative api and tools
 . support for non-commit objects
 . basic api and porcelain
 . man page and technical docs

For some reason this was extremely hard to read, partly because it had too
many distracting style violations and too many long lines.

This duplicates quite a similar traversal logic and hijacks the control
from sideways in a very core part of the revision walker, making it a
maintenance nightmare.  After I noticed that it still writes/reads
structures with bitfields directly on-disk, which I pointed out number of
times is a no-no during the initial review, I decided to eject this round
for now.

Jonathan Nieder is disecting this series into more easily digestible
chunks; in the meantime I'll get out of the way not to step on the toes of
his effort.
