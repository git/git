What's cooking in git.git (Feb 2024, #04; Thu, 8)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and
aren't considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL
to a message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity (of course they can be resubmit when new interests
arise).

The preview release Git 2.44-rc0 has been tagged.  Let's see how
well this pre-release period goes; unlike previous cycles, I planned
only for one release candidate in the middle of next week until the
final release around the 20th.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/

* kn/for-all-refs (2024-01-29) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2024-01-30 at e7a9234a8b)
 + for-each-ref: avoid filtering on empty pattern
 + refs: introduce `refs_for_each_all_refs()`
 + refs: extract out `loose_fill_ref_dir_regular_file()`
 + refs: introduce `is_pseudoref()` and `is_headref()`

 "git for-each-ref" filters its output with prefixes given from the
 command line, but it did not honor an empty string to mean "pass
 everything", which has been corrected.

 Reverted out of 'next' to revamp its UI.
