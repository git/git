What's cooking in git.git (May 2011, #11; Tue, 24)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.

The main part of this cycle is expected to run thru May, aiming for a
feature freeze in early June.

We are at the beginning of week #5 of this cycle. Let's plan to tag -rc0
with what is in 'master' at the end of the month.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* jc/fix-config-environment-passing (2011-05-24) 1 commit
 - Allow built-ins to also use -c var=val via alias

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* jl/read-tree-m-dry-run (2011-05-11) 1 commit
 - Teach read-tree the -n|--dry-run option

Waiting for a reroll.

* mg/diff-stat-count (2011-05-03) 2 commits
 - diff-options.txt: describe --stat-{width,name-width,count}
 - diff: introduce --stat-count to limit the stat lines

There was a miscounting spotted.  Need another round.

* jk/maint-merge-rename-create (2011-03-25) 3 commits
 - merge: turn on rewrite detection
 - merge: handle renames with replacement content
 - t3030: fix accidental success in symlink rename

Peff wanted to reroll this.

* jc/index-pack (2011-02-27) 5 commits
 - index-pack --verify: read anomalous offsets from v2 idx file
 - write_idx_file: need_large_offset() helper function
 - index-pack: --verify
 - write_idx_file: introduce a struct to hold idx customization options
 - index-pack: group the delta-base array entries also by type

Still a WIP. Need to put histogram output into index-pack --verify to
really kill verify-pack.

* jk/tag-contains (2010-07-05) 4 commits
 - Why is "git tag --contains" so slow?
 - default core.clockskew variable to one day
 - limit "contains" traversals based on commit timestamp
 - tag: speed up --contains calculation

The idea of the bottom one is probably Ok, except that the use of object
flags needs to be rethought, or at least the helper needs to be moved to
builtin/tag.c to make it clear that it should not be used outside the
current usage context.

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* da/git-prefix-everywhere (2011-05-23) 3 commits
 - git-mergetool--lib: Make vimdiff retain the current directory
 - git: Remove handling for GIT_PREFIX
 - setup: Provide GIT_PREFIX to built-ins

Is everybody happy with this?
Will merge to "next".

* jh/receive-count-limit (2011-05-23) 10 commits
 - receive-pack: Allow server to refuse pushes with too many objects
 - pack-objects: Estimate pack size; abort early if pack size limit is exceeded
 - send-pack/receive-pack: Allow server to refuse pushing too large packs
 - pack-objects: Allow --max-pack-size to be used together with --stdout
 - send-pack/receive-pack: Allow server to refuse pushes with too many commits
 - pack-objects: Teach new option --max-commit-count, limiting #commits in pack
 - receive-pack: Prepare for addition of the new 'limit-*' family of capabilities
 - Tighten rules for matching server capabilities in server_supports()
 - send-pack: Attempt to retrieve remote status even if pack-objects fails
 - Update technical docs to reflect side-band-64k capability in receive-pack

Would need another round to separate per-pack and per-session limits.

* jc/require-work-tree-exists (2011-05-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-05-24 at 6dbbf00)
 + require-work-tree wants more than what its name says

Rerolled _without_ any in-tree users, just to make sure that we can easily
adapt scripts when necessary in the future.

Will merge to "master" by the end of week #5.

* jn/gitweb-js (2011-05-24) 11 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-05-24 at c385b9d)
 + gitweb: Make JavaScript ability to adjust timezones configurable
 + gitweb.js: Add UI for selecting common timezone to display dates
 + gitweb: JavaScript ability to adjust time based on timezone
 + gitweb: Unify the way long timestamp is displayed
 + gitweb: Refactor generating of long dates into format_timestamp_html
 + gitweb.js: Provide getElementsByClassName method (if it not exists)
 + gitweb.js: Introduce code to handle cookies from JavaScript
 + gitweb.js: Extract and improve datetime handling
 + gitweb.js: Provide default values for padding in padLeftStr and padLeft
 + gitweb.js: Update and improve comments in JavaScript files
 + gitweb: Split JavaScript for maintability, combining on build

Rebased on top of a more recent "master" that already has the two bottom
commits in the previous round of series.

Will merge to "master" by the end of week #5.

* jn/ctags-more (2011-04-29) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-05-24 at 41b50be)
 + gitweb: Optional grouping of projects by category
 + gitweb: Modularized git_get_project_description to be more generic
 + gitweb: Split git_project_list_body in two functions

As nobody seems to be helping gitweb maintenance, I'll merge the above two
series to "master" and see if anybody screams. That seems to be the only
way to make any progress.

Will merge to "master" by the end of week #5.

* jc/notes-batch-removal (2011-05-19) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-05-23 at 5bd78a6)
 + show: --ignore-missing
 + notes remove: --stdin reads from the standard input
 + notes remove: --ignore-missing
 + notes remove: allow removing more than one

Will merge to "master" by the end of week #5.

* jk/fetch-mark-complete-optimization (2011-05-19) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-05-23 at b56fb81)
 + fetch: avoid repeated commits in mark_complete

Trivially correct.
Will merge to "master" by the end of week #5.

* jk/haves-from-alternate-odb (2011-05-19) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-05-23 at 53b4735)
 + receive-pack: eliminate duplicate .have refs
 + bisect: refactor sha1_array into a generic sha1 list
 + refactor refs_from_alternate_cb to allow passing extra data

Will merge to "master" by the end of week #5.

* rg/no-gecos-in-pwent (2011-05-19) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-05-23 at d2c4c33)
 + ident: add NO_GECOS_IN_PWENT for systems without pw_gecos in struct passwd

Trivially correct and not intrusive, but the real value unknown.
Will merge to "master" by the end of week #5.

* jc/streaming-filter (2011-05-21) 6 commits
 - streaming: filter cascading
 - streaming filter: ident filter
 - Add LF-to-CRLF streaming conversion
 - stream filter: add "no more input" to the filters
 - Add streaming filter API
 - convert.h: move declarations for conversion from cache.h
 (this branch uses jc/bigfile, jc/streaming and jc/streaming.)

Trivial lf-to-crlf and ident conversions can be performed without reading
everything in-core first. Cascading is probably still broken.  Will not
merge before 1.7.6.

* jn/userdiff-perl-updates (2011-05-23) 8 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-05-23 at 2595ae1)
 + userdiff/perl: tighten BEGIN/END block pattern to reject here-doc delimiters
 + tests: make test_expect_code quieter on success
 + userdiff/perl: catch sub with brace on second line
 + userdiff/perl: match full line of POD headers
 + userdiff/perl: anchor "sub" and "package" patterns on the left
 + t4018 (funcname patterns): minor cleanups
 + t4018 (funcname patterns): make configuration easier to track
 + t4018 (funcname patterns): make .gitattributes state easier to track

Will merge to "master" by the end of week #5.

* jc/git-handle-options-miscount (2011-05-24) 1 commit
 - handle_options(): do not miscount how many arguments were used

Updated with a trivial test, which turned out to uncover an unrelated bug
(see jc/fix-config-environment-passing topic).

* jk/combine-diff-binary-etc (2011-05-24) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-05-24 at 07cf180)
 + combine-diff: respect textconv attributes
 + refactor get_textconv to not require diff_filespec
 + combine-diff: handle binary files as binary
 + combine-diff: calculate mode_differs earlier
 + combine-diff: split header printing into its own function

Will merge to "master" by the end of month.

* jc/advice-about-to-lose-commit (2011-05-24) 1 commit
 - checkout: make advice when reattaching the HEAD less loud

Re-rolled and resurrected from "Stalled" status.
Will merge to "next".

* js/log-abbrev-commit-config (2011-05-18) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-05-23 at 4e7e932)
 + Add log.abbrevCommit config variable
 + "git log -h": typofix misspelled 'suppress'

Should be fine after several rounds of reviews.
Will merge to "master" by the middle of week #5.

* jc/streaming (2011-05-20) 13 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-05-23 at 7fd0b52)
 + streaming: read loose objects incrementally
 + sha1_file.c: expose helpers to read loose objects
 + streaming: read non-delta incrementally from a pack
 + streaming_write_entry(): support files with holes
 + convert: CRLF_INPUT is a no-op in the output codepath
 + streaming_write_entry(): use streaming API in write_entry()
 + streaming: a new API to read from the object store
 + write_entry(): separate two helper functions out
 + unpack_object_header(): make it public
 + sha1_object_info_extended(): hint about objects in delta-base cache
 + sha1_object_info_extended(): expose a bit more info
 + packed_object_info_detail(): do not return a string
 + Merge branches 'jc/convert', 'jc/bigfile' and 'jc/replacing' into jc/streaming
 (this branch is used by jc/streaming-filter and jc/streaming-filter; uses jc/bigfile.)

* jc/bigfile (2011-05-13) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-05-15 at 0ee7144)
 + Bigfile: teach "git add" to send a large file straight to a pack
 + index_fd(): split into two helper functions
 + index_fd(): turn write_object and format_check arguments into one flag
 (this branch is used by jc/streaming and jc/streaming-filter.)

This covers the entry point for a big file to the system. Other parts that
need to know about them are the exit point (i.e. write_entry()), packing
and repacking (as long as bigfilethreshold is sane this should work),
diffs and status (avoid slurping large binary in core only to do nothing,
which we already should), and transport (receive-pack/fetch-pack call
either unpack-objects or index-pack, which still want to hold the full
object in-core and need to be fixed).

Will merge to "master" by the middle of week #5.

 + Documentation: Add --line-number to git-grep synopsis

Will merge to "master" by the middle of week #5.

[Discarded]

* hg/add-i-qq (2011-05-17) 1 commit
 . add-interactive: add 'Quit' shortcut to add hunk and quit

The question "why is y+q any more deserving for a short-cut than d+q" was
raised late in the discussion, and I think it a very valid concern.

* jc/add-delete-default (2011-04-27) 1 commit
 . git add: notice removal of tracked paths by default

This is ill-thought out. When the user does want to say "take all changes
into account, not just addition", they can easily say "add -u" (update).

* jc/dotdot-is-parent-directory (2011-05-04) 1 commit
 . specifying ranges: we did not mean to make ".." an empty set

Updated documentation, but I do not feel a strong enough annoyance to push
this forward.
