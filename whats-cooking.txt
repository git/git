What's cooking in git.git (Apr 2010, #01; Fri, 02)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones
marked with '.' do not appear in any of the integration branches, but I am
still holding onto them.

Topics not in 'next' will have to wait until post 1.7.1 cycle.  I expect
that the changes still under discussion will be ready by the time the post
1.7.1 cycle begins, and we will hopefully have a cycle for 1.7.2 that is
shorter than usual to include them.

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* sb/notes-parse-opt (2010-02-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-03-24 at 82eebc1)
 + notes: rework subcommands and parse options

* cc/cherry-pick-ff (2010-03-20) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-03-20 at a1ae16b)
 + revert: fix tiny memory leak in cherry-pick --ff
 + rebase -i: use new --ff cherry-pick option
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-03-07 at 5589b26)
 + Documentation: describe new cherry-pick --ff option
 + cherry-pick: add tests for new --ff option
 + revert: add --ff option to allow fast forward when cherry-picking

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* cw/ws-indent-with-tab (2010-04-01) 2 commits
 - whitespace: we cannot "catch all errors known to git" anymore
 - Add tab-in-indent whitespace error class

Not quite ready until "apply --whitespace=fix" gets a matching change.

* ic/bash-completion-rpm (2010-03-26) 1 commit
 - RPM spec: include bash completion support

This is needed in 'master' by -rc1 at the latest.  Soon in 'next'.

* js/grep-open (2010-03-26) 2 commits
 - grep -O: allow optional argument specifying the pager (or editor)
 - grep: Add the option '--open-files-in-pager'

Probably needs to support --no-index mode as well.

* mg/notes-reflog (2010-03-29) 2 commits
 - refs.c: Write reflogs for notes just like for branch heads
 - t3301-notes: Test the creation of reflog entries

Implementation is trivially correct; I am unsure if "notes" tree wants
reflog in the first place, though.  Please convince me and I'll move it
to 'next' soon, aiming for -rc0 or -rc1 at the latest.

* rr/remote-helper-doc (2010-03-28) 2 commits
 - Documentation/remote-helpers: Fix some typos
 - Documentation/remote-helpers: Rewrite description

Although I lost track of this series with too rapid succession of
updates, intermixed with some documentation updates in the related
areas, my impression is that area experts haven't Acked them yet.

* sr/remote-helper-export (2010-03-29) 7 commits
 - remote-helpers: add tests for testgit helper
 - remote-helpers: add testgit helper
 - remote-helpers: add support for an export command
 - remote-helpers: allow requesing the path to the .git directory
 - fast-import: always create marks_file directories
 - clone: also configure url for bare clones
 - clone: pass the remote name to remote_get

May merge to 'next', but I would prefer waiting til 1.7.2 to have
this with a confidence than fast-tracking it.

* cc/revert-strategy (2010-03-31) 5 commits
 - revert: add "--strategy" option to choose merge strategy
 - merge: make function try_merge_command non static
 - merge: refactor code that calls "git merge-STRATEGY"
 - revert: refactor merge recursive code into its own function
 - revert: use strbuf to refactor the code that writes the merge message
 (this branch uses jn/merge-diff3-label.)

May merge to 'next' soon, but this is more about debugging and we are not
in a great hurry.

* mr/gitweb-jsmin (2010-04-01) 6 commits
 - gitweb: update INSTALL to use shorter make target
 - gitweb: add documentation to INSTALL regarding gitweb.js
 - instaweb: add minification awareness
 - Gitweb: add autoconfigure support for minifiers

Soon in 'next' when minor rewording replacement patches come; otherwise
felt solid.

* sc/http-late-auth (2010-04-01) 1 commit
 - Prompt for a username when an HTTP request 401s

May merge to 'next', but I would prefer waiting til 1.7.2 to have

May merge to 'next', but I would prefer waiting til 1.7.2 to have
this with a confidence than fast-tracking it.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* cw/test-lib-relicense (2010-02-22) 1 commit
 . test-lib.sh: Add explicit license detail, with change from GPLv2 to GPLv2+.

Ack-collection stopped at the last three names.  I am hoping Carl can take
it from there without my keeping an eye on it.

* js/rebase-origin-x (2010-02-05) 1 commit
 - [RFC w/o test and incomplete] rebase: add -x option to record original commit name

I retract my objection against the idea of -x; needs polishing before
moving forward.

  (merged to 'next' on 2010-03-08 at 58a6fba)

 - Make xmalloc and xrealloc thread-safe

Still has locking issues?

 + Reimplement async procedures using pthreads
 + Windows: more pthreads functions
 + Fix signature of fcntl() compatibility dummy
 + Make report() from usage.c public as vreportf() and use it.

Linus made a good point of making this a default, and Erick Mattos
confirmed that it won't be a problem even on Windows.

Will move to 'next' after such a "default on" change, keep it there until
1.7.1 ships, warn about it in the release notes as an upcoming backward
incompatibility, and then move to 'master' after 1.7.1.
