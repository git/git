What's cooking in git.git (May 2013, #03; Thu, 9)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.

I'll tag 1.8.3-rc2 by the end of the week, and hopefully we can have
a solid final release late next week.  One embarrassing regression
was found and had to be fixed today.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* fc/sha1-name-at-home (2013-05-07) 14 commits
 - sha1_name: compare variable with constant, not constant with variable
 - Add new @ shortcut for HEAD
 - sha1_name: refactor reinterpret()
 - sha1_name: check @{-N} errors sooner
 - sha1_name: reorganize get_sha1_basic()
 - sha1_name: don't waste cycles in the @-parsing loop
 - sha1_name: remove unnecessary braces
 - sha1_name: remove no-op
 - tests: at-combinations: @{N} versus HEAD@{N}
 - tests: at-combinations: increase coverage
 - tests: at-combinations: improve nonsense()
 - SQUASH??? style fixups
 - tests: at-combinations: check ref names directly
 - tests: at-combinations: simplify setup

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* jh/shorten-refname (2013-05-07) 4 commits
 - t1514: refname shortening is done after dereferencing symbolic refs
 - shorten_unambiguous_ref(): Fix shortening refs/remotes/origin/HEAD to origin
 - t1514: Demonstrate failure to correctly shorten "refs/remotes/origin/HEAD"
 - t1514: Add tests of shortening refnames in strict/loose mode

 When remotes/origin/HEAD is not a symbolic ref, "rev-parse
 --abbrev-ref remotes/origin/HEAD" ought to show "origin", not
 "origin/HEAD", which is fixed with this series (if it is a symbolic
 ref that points at remotes/origin/something, then it should show
 "origin/something" and it already does).


* nd/clone-local-with-colon (2013-05-07) 1 commit
 - clone: allow cloning local paths with colons in them

 "git clone foo/bar:baz" cannot be a request to clone from a remote
 over git-over-ssh specified in the scp style.  Detect this case and
 clone from a local repository at "foo/bar:baz".


* nd/warn-ambiguous-object-name (2013-05-07) 1 commit
 - get_sha1: improve ambiguity warning regarding SHA-1 and ref names

 "git cmd <name>", when <name> happens to be a 40-hex string,
 directly uses the 40-hex string as an object name, even if a ref
 "refs/<some hierarchy>/<name>" exists.  This disambiguation order
 is unlikely to change, but we should warn about the ambiguity just
 like we warn when more than one refs/ hierachies share the same
 name.

 The message needs to be fixed up, as this is not "refname is
 ambiguous".


* fc/zsh-leftover-bits (2013-05-08) 2 commits
 - completion: synchronize zsh wrapper
 - completion: cleanup zsh wrapper


* rs/empty-archive (2013-05-09) 2 commits
 - t5004: resurrect original empty tar archive test
 - t5004: avoid using tar for checking emptiness of archive

 Fixes tests added in 1.8.2 era that are broken on BSDs,
 but it is not all that urgent.


* vv/help-unknown-ref (2013-05-08) 2 commits
 - merge: use help_unknown_ref()
 - help: add help_unknown_ref()

 Detect "git merge foo" that might have meant "git merge origin/foo"
 and give an error message that is more specific than "foo is not
 something we can merge".

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* mg/more-textconv (2013-04-23) 7 commits
 - git grep: honor textconv by default
 - grep: honor --textconv for the case rev:path
 - grep: allow to use textconv filters
 - t7008: demonstrate behavior of grep with textconv
 - cat-file: do not die on --textconv without textconv filters
 - show: honor --textconv for blobs
 - t4030: demonstrate behavior of show with textconv

 Rerolled. I am not sure if I like "show <blob>" and "grep" that use
 textconv by default, though.


* mh/multimail (2013-04-21) 1 commit
 - git-multimail: a replacement for post-receive-email

 Waiting for the initial history to pull from.
 $gmane/223564


* jc/format-patch (2013-04-22) 2 commits
 - format-patch: --inline-single
 - format-patch: rename "no_inline" field

 A new option to send a single patch to the standard output to be
 appended at the bottom of a message.  I personally have no need for
 this, but it was easy enough to cobble together.  Tests, docs and
 stripping out more MIMEy stuff are left as exercises to interested
 parties.

 Not ready for inclusion.


* jk/gitweb-utf8 (2013-04-08) 4 commits
 - gitweb: Fix broken blob action parameters on blob/commitdiff pages
 - gitweb: Don't append ';js=(0|1)' to external links
 - gitweb: Make feed title valid utf8
 - gitweb: Fix utf8 encoding for blob_plain, blobdiff_plain, commitdiff_plain, and patch

 Various fixes to gitweb.

 Waiting for a reroll after a review.


* jk/commit-info-slab (2013-04-19) 3 commits
 - commit-slab: introduce a macro to define a slab for new type
 - commit-slab: avoid large realloc
 - commit: allow associating auxiliary info on-demand
 (this branch is used by jc/show-branch.)

 Technology demonstration to show a way we could use unbound number
 of flag bits on commit objects.


* jn/config-ignore-inaccessible (2013-04-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-05-07 at 4f09e24)
 + config: allow inaccessible configuration under $HOME

 When $HOME is misconfigured to point at an unreadable directory, we
 used to complain and die. This loosens the check.

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* fc/fast-export-persistent-marks (2013-05-07) 3 commits
 - fast-{import,export}: use get_sha1_hex() to read from marks file
 - fast-export: don't parse commits while reading marks file
 - fast-export: do not parse non-commit objects while reading marks file

 Optimization for fast-export by avoiding unnecessarily resolving
 arbitrary object name and parsing object when only presence and
 type information is necessary, etc.


* jc/core-checkstat-2.0 (2013-05-06) 2 commits
 - core.statinfo: remove as promised in Git 2.0
 - deprecate core.statinfo at Git 2.0 boundary

 The bottom one is a fix for a breakage of a new feature in 1.8.2
 but it is not all that urgent.


* jk/packed-refs-race (2013-05-06) 4 commits
 - for_each_ref: load all loose refs before packed refs
 - get_packed_refs: reload packed-refs file when it changes
 - add a stat_validity struct
 - resolve_ref: close race condition for packed refs


* fc/at-head (2013-05-08) 13 commits
 - sha1_name: compare variable with constant, not constant with variable
 - Add new @ shortcut for HEAD
 - sha1_name: refactor reinterpret()
 - sha1_name: check @{-N} errors sooner
 - sha1_name: reorganize get_sha1_basic()
 - sha1_name: don't waste cycles in the @-parsing loop
 - sha1_name: remove unnecessary braces
 - sha1_name: remove no-op
 - tests: at-combinations: @{N} versus HEAD@{N}
 - tests: at-combinations: increase coverage
 - tests: at-combinations: improve nonsense()
 - tests: at-combinations: check ref names directly
 - tests: at-combinations: simplify setup

 Instead of typing four capital letters "HEAD", you can say "@"
 instead.


* jk/lookup-object-prefer-latest (2013-05-02) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-05-06 at cc59dcc)
 + lookup_object: prioritize recently found objects

 Optimizes object lookup when the object hashtable starts to become
 crowded.


* jk/subtree-do-not-push-if-split-fails (2013-05-01) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-05-06 at 81bdf37)
 + contrib/subtree: don't delete remote branches if split fails

 "git subtree" (in contrib/) had one codepath with loose error
 checks to lose data at the remote side.


* fc/completion (2013-04-27) 9 commits
 - completion: remove __git_index_file_list_filter()
 - completion: add space after completed filename
 - completion: add hack to enable file mode in bash < 4
 - completion: refactor __git_complete_index_file()
 - completion: refactor diff_index wrappers
 - completion: use __gitcompadd for __gitcomp_file
 - completion; remove unuseful comments
 - completion: document tilde expansion failure in tests
 - completion: add file completion tests

 I saw this discussed somewhat. Is everybody happy with this
 version?  This is its v2, in the $gmane/222682 thread.


* jk/test-output (2013-05-06) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-05-06 at 7c03af3)
 + t/Makefile: don't define TEST_RESULTS_DIRECTORY recursively
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-05-01 at 63827c9)
 + test output: respect $TEST_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
 + t/Makefile: fix result handling with TEST_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY

 When TEST_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY setting is used, it was handled somewhat
 inconsistently between the test framework and t/Makefile, and logic
 to summarize the results looked at a wrong place.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* rj/mingw-cygwin (2013-05-08) 2 commits
 - cygwin: Remove the CYGWIN_V15_WIN32API build variable
 - mingw: rename WIN32 cpp macro to GIT_WINDOWS_NATIVE

 Update build for Cygwin 1.[57].  There seems to be an ongoing
 discussion on the list.


* rj/sparse (2013-04-28) 10 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-05-01 at 649e16c)

 Will cook in 'next'.


* js/transport-helper-error-reporting-fix (2013-04-28) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-29 at 8cc4bb8)
 + git-remote-testgit: build it to run under $SHELL_PATH
 + git-remote-testgit: further remove some bashisms
 + git-remote-testgit: avoid process substitution
 (this branch uses fc/transport-helper-error-reporting.)

 Finishing touches to fc/transport-helper-error-reporting topic.
 Will cook in 'next'.


* mh/fetch-into-shallow (2013-05-02) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-05-03 at 3fadc61)
 + t5500: add test for fetching with an unknown 'shallow'
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-29 at a167d3e)
 + upload-pack: ignore 'shallow' lines with unknown obj-ids

 Will cook in 'next'.


* kb/full-history-compute-treesame-carefully (2013-05-06) 11 commits
 - revision.c: treat A...B merge bases as if manually specified
 - revision.c: discount side branches when computing TREESAME
 - simplify-merges: drop merge from irrelevant side branch
 - simplify-merges: never remove all TREESAME parents
 - t6012: update test for tweaked full-history traversal
 - revision.c: Make --full-history consider more merges
 - rev-list-options.txt: correct TREESAME for P
 - t6111: allow checking the parents as well
 - t6111: new TREESAME test set
 - t6019: test file dropped in -s ours merge
 - decorate.c: compact table when growing

 Major update to a very core part of the system to improve culling
 of irrelevant parents while traversing a mergy history.

 Will not be a 1.8.3 material, but is an important topic.


* jh/checkout-auto-tracking (2013-04-21) 8 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-22 at 2356700)
 + glossary: Update and rephrase the definition of a remote-tracking branch
 + branch.c: Validate tracking branches with refspecs instead of refs/remotes/*
 + t9114.2: Don't use --track option against "svn-remote"-tracking branches
 + t7201.24: Add refspec to keep --track working
 + t3200.39: tracking setup should fail if there is no matching refspec.
 + checkout: Use remote refspecs when DWIMming tracking branches
 + t2024: Show failure to use refspec when DWIMming remote branch names
 + t2024: Add tests verifying current DWIM behavior of 'git checkout <branch>'

 Updates "git checkout foo" that DWIMs the intended "upstream" and
 turns it into "git checkout -t -b foo remotes/origin/foo" to
 correctly take existing remote definitions into account.  The
 remote "origin" may be what uniquely map its own branch to
 remotes/some/where/foo but that some/where may not be "origin".

 Will cook in 'next'.


* jc/prune-all (2013-04-25) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-26 at 97a7387)
 + prune: introduce OPT_EXPIRY_DATE() and use it
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-22 at b00ccf6)
 + api-parse-options.txt: document "no-" for non-boolean options
 + git-gc.txt, git-reflog.txt: document new expiry options
 + date.c: add parse_expiry_date()
 (this branch is used by mh/packed-refs-various.)

 We used the approxidate() parser for "--expire=<timestamp>" options
 of various commands, but it is better to treat --expire=all and
 --expire=now a bit more specially than using the current timestamp.
 Update "git gc" and "git reflog" with a new parsing function for
 expiry dates.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* as/check-ignore (2013-04-29) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-30 at 646931f)
 + t0008: use named pipe (FIFO) to test check-ignore streaming
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-21 at 7515aa8)
 + Documentation: add caveats about I/O buffering for check-{attr,ignore}
 + check-ignore: allow incremental streaming of queries via --stdin
 + check-ignore: move setup into cmd_check_ignore()
 + check-ignore: add -n / --non-matching option
 + t0008: remove duplicated test fixture data

 Enhance "check-ignore" (1.8.2 update) to work more like "check-attr"
 over bidi-pipes.

 Will cook in 'next'.

 (this branch is used by js/transport-helper-error-reporting-fix.)

 Update transport helper to report errors and maintain ref hierarchy
 used to keep track of remote helper state better.

 Will cook in 'next', but may be 1.8.3 material depending on how things go.

  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-19 at 45ae3c9)
 + rm: delete .gitmodules entry of submodules removed from the work tree
 + Teach mv to update the path entry in .gitmodules for moved submodules
 + Teach mv to move submodules using a gitfile
 + Teach mv to move submodules together with their work trees

 inclusing relocating its working tree and adjusting the paths in
 the .gitmodules file.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* jn/add-2.0-u-A-sans-pathspec (2013-04-26) 1 commit
