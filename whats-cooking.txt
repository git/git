What's cooking in git.git (Dec 2019, #05; Thu, 26)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

The early preview for the upcoming Git 2.25 has been tagged.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* am/pathspec-f-f-checkout (2019-12-04) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-12-10 at 6b018bd997)
 + checkout, restore: support the --pathspec-from-file option
 + doc: restore: synchronize <pathspec> description
 + doc: checkout: synchronize <pathspec> description
 + doc: checkout: fix broken text reference
 + doc: checkout: remove duplicate synopsis
 + add: support the --pathspec-from-file option
 + cmd_add: prepare for next patch

 A few more commands learned the "--pathspec-from-file" command line
 option.


* am/pathspec-from-file (2019-12-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-12-19 at e250cc9b88)
 + commit: forbid --pathspec-from-file --all

 An earlier series to teach "--pathspec-from-file" to "git commit"
 forgot to make the option incompatible with "--all", which has been
 corrected.


* dl/format-patch-notes-config-fixup (2019-12-18) 8 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-12-19 at 1abc6941e0)
 + notes.h: fix typos in comment
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-12-16 at e4da5b93bb)
 + notes: break set_display_notes() into smaller functions
 + config/format.txt: clarify behavior of multiple format.notes
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-12-10 at 2d8830090f)

 + format-patch: use --notes behavior for format.notes
 + notes: extract logic into set_display_notes()
 + notes: create init_display_notes() helper
 + notes: rename to load_display_notes()

 "git format-patch" can take a set of configured format.notes values
 to specify which notes refs to use in the log message part of the
 output.  The behaviour of this was not consistent with multiple
 --notes command line options, which has been corrected.


* ds/sparse-cone (2019-12-20) 21 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-12-20 at 4f33a10613)

 + sparse-checkout: add '--stdin' option to set subcommand
 + sparse-checkout: 'set' subcommand
 + clone: add --sparse mode
 + sparse-checkout: create 'init' subcommand

 Management of sparsely checked-out working tree has gained a
 dedicated "sparse-checkout" command.

 - rebase: make sure to pass along the quiet flag to the sequencer
 - rebase, sequencer: remove the broken GIT_QUIET handling
 - t3406: simplify an already simple test

 "git rebase" has learned to use the sequencer backend by default,
 while allowing "--am" option to go back to the traditional "am"
 backend.

 Preparation of test scripts for the day when the object names will
 use SHA-256 continues.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* js/mingw-reserved-filenames (2019-12-21) 2 commits
 - mingw: refuse paths containing reserved names
 - mingw: short-circuit the conversion of `/dev/null` to UTF-16

 Forbid pathnames that the platform's filesystem cannot represent on
 MinGW.

 Will merge to 'next' and then to 'master'.


* bk/p4-exception-cleanup (2019-12-16) 2 commits
 - git-p4: failure because of RCS keywords should show help
 - git-p4: wrap patchRCSKeywords test to revert changes on failure
 (this branch uses bk/p4-misc-usability.)


* ew/packfile-syscall-optim (2019-12-26) 2 commits
 - packfile: replace lseek+read with pread
 - packfile: remove redundant fcntl F_GETFD/F_SETFD

 Code cleanup.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jn/test-lint-one-shot-export-to-shell-function (2019-12-26) 2 commits
 - t/check-non-portable-shell: detect "FOO= shell_func", too
 - fetch test: avoid use of "VAR= cmd" with a shell function
 (this branch is used by jn/promote-proto2-to-default.)

 The test-lint machinery knew to check "VAR=VAL shell_function"
 construct, but did not check "VAR= shell_funciton", which has been
 corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* js/add-p-leftover-bits (2019-12-24) 9 commits
 - ci: include the built-in `git add -i` in the `linux-gcc` job
 - built-in add -p: handle Escape sequences more efficiently
 - built-in add -p: handle Escape sequences in interactive.singlekey mode

 (this branch uses js/patch-mode-in-others-in-c.)


* js/mingw-loosen-overstrict-tree-entry-checks (2019-12-26) 1 commit
 - mingw: only test index entries for backslashes, not tree entries

 An earlier update to Git for Windows declared that a tree object is
 invalid if it has a path component with backslash in it, which was
 overly strict, which has been corrected.  The only protection the
 Windows users need is to prevent such path (or any path that their
 filesystem cannot check out) from entering the index.



* pb/clarify-line-log-doc (2019-12-26) 2 commits
 - doc: log, gitk: line-log arguments must exist in starting revision
 - doc: log, gitk: document accepted line-log diff formats

 Doc update.

 Will merge to 'next'.

[Stalled]

* ag/edit-todo-drop-check (2019-12-06) 2 commits
 - rebase-interactive: warn if commit is dropped with `rebase --edit-todo'
 - sequencer: move check_todo_list_from_file() to rebase-interactive.c

 Allow the rebase.missingCommitsCheck configuration to kick in when
 "rebase --edit-todo" and "rebase --continue" restarts the procedure.

 Broken.

* es/pathspec-f-f-grep (2019-12-13) 1 commit
 - grep: support the --pathspec-from-file option

 "git grep" learned the "--pathspec-from-file" command line
 option.

 Waiting for review responses.

* at/rebase-fork-point-regression-fix (2019-12-09) 1 commit
 - rebase: fix --fork-point with short refname

 The "--fork-point" mode of "git rebase" regressed when the command
 was rewritten in C back in 2.20 era, which has been corrected.

 Was waiting for discussion to settle.

 - builtin/config: die if "value_regex" doesn't canonicalize as boolean
 - builtin/config: warn if "value_regex" doesn't canonicalize as boolean
 - builtin/config: canonicalize "value_regex" with `--type=bool-or-int`
 - builtin/config: canonicalize "value_regex" with `--type=bool`
 - builtin/config: collect "value_regexp" data in a struct
 - builtin/config: extract `handle_value_regex()` from `get_value()`
 - t1300: modernize part of script
 - config: make `git_parse_maybe_bool_text()` public

 "git config" can be told to affect the existing entries that
 "match" the given value via its value_regex argument.  It learned
 to normalize the value set in the configuration and the value given
 from the command line before computing they "match", e.g. "true" in
 the configuration file can now match with "yes" given from the
 command line.

 Needs a bit more work?

* mt/threaded-grep-in-object-store (2019-10-02) 11 commits
 - grep: move driver pre-load out of critical section
 - grep: re-enable threads in non-worktree case
 - grep: protect packed_git [re-]initialization
 - grep: allow submodule functions to run in parallel
 - submodule-config: add skip_if_read option to repo_read_gitmodules()

 - object-store: allow threaded access to object reading
 - replace-object: make replace operations thread-safe
 - grep: fix racy calls in grep_objects()
 - grep: fix race conditions at grep_submodule()
 - grep: fix race conditions on userdiff calls

 Traditionally, we avoided threaded grep while searching in objects
 (as opposed to files in the working tree) as accesses to the object
 layer is not thread-safe.  This limitation is getting lifted.

 Expecting a reroll.

* vn/reset-deleted-ita (2019-07-26) 1 commit
 - reset: unstage empty deleted ita files

 "git reset HEAD [<pathspec>]" did not reset an empty file that was
 added with the intent-to-add bit.

 Expecting a reroll.


* jn/unknown-index-extensions (2018-11-21) 2 commits
 - index: offer advice for unknown index extensions
 - index: do not warn about unrecognized extensions

 A bit too alarming warning given when unknown index extensions
 exist is getting revamped.

 Expecting a reroll.


* jc/format-patch-delay-message-id (2019-04-05) 1 commit
 - format-patch: move message-id and related headers to the end

 The location "git format-patch --thread" adds the Message-Id:
 header in the series of header fields has been moved down, which
 may help working around a suspected bug in GMail MSA, reported at
 <CAHk-=whP1stFZNAaJiMi5eZ9rj0MRt20Y_yHVczZPH+O01d+sA@mail.gmail.com>

 Waiting for feedback to see if it truly helps.
 Needs tests.


* js/protocol-advertise-multi (2018-12-28) 1 commit
 - protocol: advertise multiple supported versions

 The transport layer has been updated so that the protocol version
 used can be negotiated between the parties, by the initiator
 listing the protocol versions it is willing to talk, and the other
 side choosing from one of them.

 Expecting a reroll.

* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2018-10-15) 1 commit
 - zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

* pw/advise-rebase-skip (2019-12-06) 9 commits
 - rebase -i: leave CHERRY_PICK_HEAD when there are conflicts
 - rebase: fix advice when a fixup creates an empty commit
 - commit: give correct advice for empty commit during a rebase
 - commit: encapsulate determine_whence() for sequencer
 - commit: use enum value for multiple cherry-picks
 - sequencer: write CHERRY_PICK_HEAD for reword and edit
 - cherry-pick: check commit error messages
 - cherry-pick: add test for `--skip` advice in `git commit`
 - t3404: use test_cmp_rev

 The mechanism to prevent "git commit" from making an empty commit
 or amending during an interrupted cherry-pick was broken during the
 rewrite of "git rebase" in C, which has been corrected.

 Needs review.
 The tip two are still RFC.

 + pack-objects: improve partial packfile reuse
 + builtin/pack-objects: introduce obj_is_packed()

* js/advise-rebase-skip (2019-10-23) 3 commits
 . commit: give correct advice for empty commit during a rebase
 . sequencer: export the function to get the path of `.git/rebase-merge/`
 . cherry-pick: add test for `--skip` advice in `git commit`

 The logic used in "git commit" to give hints and errors depending
 on what operation was in progress learned to distinguish rebase and
 cherry-pick better.

 Superseded by pw/advise-rebase-skip
