Subject: What's cooking in git.git (Oct 2018, #05; Fri, 26)
X-master-at: c670b1f876521c9f7cd40184bf7ed05aad843433

What's cooking in git.git (Oct 2018, #05; Fri, 26)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

Quite a few topics have graduated to 'master'.  At sixth batch,
'master' now has 450+ patches since v2.19 and 'next' has additional
170+ patches pending.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* ab/gc-doc-update (2018-10-11) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-19 at 84347d36a7)
 + gc doc: mention the commit-graph in the intro

 The documentation of "git gc" has been updated to mention that it
 is no longer limited to "pruning away crufts" but also updates
 ancillary files like commit-graph as a part of repository
 optimization.


* bc/editorconfig (2018-10-09) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-16 at 81461ae0fd)
 + editorconfig: indicate settings should be kept in sync
 + editorconfig: provide editor settings for Git developers

 To help developers, an EditorConfig file that attempts to follow
 the project convention has been added.


* ds/coverage-diff (2018-10-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-16 at c12b7279d9)
 + contrib: add coverage-diff script

 The result of coverage test can be combined with "git blame" to
 check the test coverage of code introduced recently with a new
 'coverage-diff' tool (in contrib/).


* du/cherry-is-plumbing (2018-10-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-19 at ffe6c5449e)
 + doc: move git-cherry to plumbing

 Doc update to mark "git cherry" as a plumbing command.

  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-16 at 23e7f018cd)
 + doc: move git-get-tar-commit-id to plumbing

 Doc update to mark "git get-tar-commit-id" as a plumbing command.


* du/rev-parse-is-plumbing (2018-10-11) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-16 at 50aca759e2)
 + doc: move git-rev-parse from porcelain to plumbing

 Doc update.


* js/fuzzer (2018-10-15) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-19 at 649a2bf1fb)
 + fuzz: add fuzz testing for packfile indices.
 + fuzz: add basic fuzz testing target.

 An experiment to fuzz test a few areas, hopefully we can gain more
 coverage to various areas.


* js/mingw-default-ident (2018-10-16) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-19 at 2f710c811b)
 + mingw: use domain information for default email
 + getpwuid(mingw): provide a better default for the user name
 + getpwuid(mingw): initialize the structure only once

 The logic to select the default user name and e-mail on Windows has
 been improved.


* ld/p4-unshelve (2018-10-16) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-19 at 35339798f9)
 + git-p4: fully support unshelving changelists
 + git-p4: unshelve into refs/remotes/p4-unshelved, not refs/remotes/p4/unshelved
 + git-p4: do not fail in verbose mode for missing 'fileSize' key

 "git p4 unshelve" improvements.


* ma/t7005-bash-workaround (2018-09-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-16 at 543e1e6574)
 + t7005-editor: quote filename to fix whitespace-issue

 Test fix.


* mm/doc-no-dashed-git (2018-10-11) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-16 at c26bcd740b)
 + doc: fix a typo and clarify a sentence

 Doc update.


* np/log-graph-octopus-fix (2018-10-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-16 at aa00813683)
 + log: fix coloring of certain octopus merge shapes

 "git log --graph" showing an octopus merge sometimes miscounted the
 number of display columns it is consuming to show the merge and its
 parent commits, which has been corrected.


* rs/subtree-fixes (2018-10-12) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-16 at be23c9343c)
 + subtree: performance improvement for finding unexpected parent commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-12 at 2b47258e04)
 + subtree: improve decision on merges kept in split
 + subtree: use commits before rejoins for splits
 + subtree: make --ignore-joins pay attention to adds
 + subtree: refactor split of a commit into standalone method

 Various subtree fixes.
 Unless somebody objects, that is.


* rv/alias-help (2018-10-11) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-19 at f16bbfb3ef)
 + git-help.txt: document "git help cmd" vs "git cmd --help" for aliases
 + git.c: handle_alias: prepend alias info when first argument is -h
 + help: redirect to aliased commands for "git cmd --help"

 "git cmd --help" when "cmd" is aliased used to only say "cmd is
 aliased to ...".  Now it shows that to the standard error stream
 and runs "git $cmd --help" where $cmd is the first word of the
 alias expansion.

 This could be misleading for those who alias a command with options
 (e.g. with "[alias] cpn = cherry-pick -n", "git cpn --help" would
 show the manual of "cherry-pick", and the reader would not be told
 to pay close attention to the part that describes the "--no-commit"
 option until closing the pager that showed the contents of the
 manual, if the pager is configured to restore the original screen,
 or would not be told at all, if the pager simply makes the message
 on the standard error scroll away.


* sb/diff-emit-line-ws-markup-cleanup (2018-10-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-16 at a68a6f0003)
 + diff.c: pass sign_index to emit_line_ws_markup

 Code clean-up.


* sg/split-index-racefix (2018-10-12) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-16 at c1d6563c51)
 + split-index: BUG() when cache entry refers to non-existing shared entry
 + split-index: smudge and add racily clean cache entries to split index
 + split-index: don't compare cached data of entries already marked for split index
 + split-index: count the number of deleted entries
 + t1700-split-index: date back files to avoid racy situations
 + split-index: add tests to demonstrate the racy split index problem
 + t1700-split-index: document why FSMONITOR is disabled in this test script

 The codepath to support the experimental split-index mode had
 remaining "racily clean" issues fixed.

* nd/per-worktree-config (2018-10-22) 2 commits
 - worktree: add per-worktree config files
 - t1300: extract and use test_cmp_config()

 A fourth class of configuration files (in addition to the
 traditional "system wide", "per user in the $HOME directory" and
 "per repository in the $GIT_DIR/config") has been introduced so
 that different worktrees that share the same repository (hence the
 same $GIT_DIR/config file) can use different customization.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* nd/submodule-unused-vars (2018-10-22) 1 commit
 - submodule.c: remove some of the_repository references

 Code clean-up.

* bp/reset-quiet (2018-10-24) 3 commits
 - reset: warn when refresh_index() takes more than 2 seconds
 - reset: add new reset.quiet config setting
 - reset: don't compute unstaged changes after reset when --quiet

 "git reset --quiet" no longer runs "update-index --refresh"
 internally, which shifts the refresh cost away from the command.

 Will merge to 'next'.

  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-26 at f31abc8d8f)
 + mingw: fix getcwd when the parent directory cannot be queried
 + mingw: ensure `getcwd()` reports the correct case

 The way the Windows port figures out the current directory has been
 improved.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* js/mingw-load-sys-dll (2018-10-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-26 at 1f458a7e04)
 + mingw: load system libraries the recommended way

 The way DLLs are loaded on the Windows port has been improved.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* js/rebase-autostash-fix (2018-10-24) 5 commits
 - rebase --autostash: fix issue with dirty submodules
 - rebase --autostash: demonstrate a problem with dirty submodules
 - rebase (autostash): use an explicit OID to apply the stash
 - rebase (autostash): store the full OID in <state-dir>/autostash
 - rebase (autostash): avoid duplicate call to state_dir_path()
 (this branch uses ag/rebase-i-in-c, js/rebase-in-c-5.5-work-with-rebase-i-in-c, pk/rebase-in-c, pk/rebase-in-c-2-basic, pk/rebase-in-c-3-acts, pk/rebase-in-c-4-opts, pk/rebase-in-c-5-test and pk/rebase-in-c-6-final; is tangled with ag/sequencer-reduce-rewriting-todo, jc/rebase-in-c-5-test-typofix, js/rebase-i-break and js/rebase-i-shortopt.)

 "git rebase" that has recently been rewritten in C had a few issues
 in its "--autstash" feature, which have been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* js/remote-archive-dwimfix (2018-10-26) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-26 at f5bf6946bd)
 + archive: initialize archivers earlier

 The logic to determine the archive type "git archive" uses did not
 correctly kick in for "git archive --remote", which has been
 corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* js/shallow-and-fetch-prune (2018-10-25) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-26 at 93b7196560)
 + repack -ad: prune the list of shallow commits
 + shallow: offer to prune only non-existing entries
 + repack: point out a bug handling stale shallow info

 "git repack" in a shallow clone did not correctly update the
 shallow points in the repository, leading to a repository that
 does not pass fsck.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jw/send-email-no-auth (2018-10-23) 1 commit
 - send-email: explicitly disable authentication

 "git send-email" learned to disable SMTP authentication via the
 "--smtp-auth=none" option, even when the smtp username is given
 (which turns the authentication on by default).

 Will merge to 'next'.


* md/exclude-promisor-objects-fix (2018-10-23) 2 commits
 - exclude-promisor-objects: declare when option is allowed
 - Documentation/git-log.txt: do not show --exclude-promisor-objects

 Operations on promisor objects make sense in the context of only a
 small subset of the commands that internally use the revisions
 machinery, but the "--exclude-promisor-objects" option were taken
 and led to nonsense results by commands like "log", to which it
 didn't make much sense.  This has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* mg/gpg-fingerprint (2018-10-23) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-26 at 1e219cb754)
 + gpg-interface.c: obtain primary key fingerprint as well
 + gpg-interface.c: support getting key fingerprint via %GF format
 + gpg-interface.c: use flags to determine key/signer info presence
 (this branch uses mg/gpg-parse-tighten; is tangled with jc/gpg-cocci-preincr.)

 New "--pretty=format:" placeholders %GF and %GP that show the GPG
 key fingerprints have been invented.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 "--date=auto" can be used to use this new format when the output is
 goint to the pager or to the terminal and otherwise the default
 format.

 + diff: don't attempt to strip prefix from absolute Windows paths

 Under certain circumstances, "git diff D:/a/b/c D:/a/b/d" on
 Windows would strip initial parts from the paths because they
 were not recognized as absolute, which has been corrected.

 + send-email: also pick up cc addresses from -by trailers
 + send-email: only consider lines containing @ or <> for automatic Cc'ing
 + Documentation/git-send-email.txt: style fixes

 "git send-email" learned to grab address-looking string on any
 trailer whose name ends with "-by"; --suppress-cc=misc-by on the
 command line, or setting sendemail.suppresscc configuration
 variable to "misc-by", can be used to disable this behaviour.

 This is a backward-incompatible change that may surprise existing
 users.

 + rebase -i: clarify what happens on a failed `exec`
 (this branch is used by js/rebase-i-shortopt; uses ag/rebase-i-in-c; is tangled with ag/sequencer-reduce-rewriting-todo, js/rebase-autostash-fix, js/rebase-in-c-5.5-work-with-rebase-i-in-c and pk/rebase-in-c-6-final.)

 "git rebase -i" learned a new insn, 'break', that the user can
 insert in the to-do list.  Upon hitting it, the command returns
 control back to the user.

 Will merge to 'master' after 'pk/rebase-in-c-6-final'.

 + archive: allow archive over HTTP(S) with proto v2
 + archive: implement protocol v2 archive command
 + archive: use packet_reader for communications
 + archive: follow test standards around assertions

 The original implementation of "git archive --remote" more or less
 bypassed the transport layer and did not work over http(s).  The
 version 2 of the protocol is defined to allow going over http(s) as
 well as Git native transport.

 Will hold.

 - sequencer: make the todo_list structure public
 - sequencer: clear the number of items of a todo_list before parsing
 - Merge branch 'ag/rebase-i-in-c' into ag/sequencer-reduce-rewriting-todo
 (this branch uses ag/rebase-i-in-c; is tangled with js/rebase-autostash-fix, js/rebase-i-break, js/rebase-i-shortopt, js/rebase-in-c-5.5-work-with-rebase-i-in-c and pk/rebase-in-c-6-final.)

 The scripted version of "git rebase -i" wrote and rewrote the todo
 list many times during a single step of its operation, and the
 recent C-rewrite made a faithful conversion of the logic to C.  The
 implementation has been updated to carry necessary information
 around in-core to avoid rewriting the same file over and over
 unnecessarily.

 Will hold, waiting for the "rebase-in-c" and "rebase-i-in-c" topics.

 + rebase: default to using the builtin rebase
 (this branch is used by js/rebase-autostash-fix; uses ag/rebase-i-in-c, js/rebase-in-c-5.5-work-with-rebase-i-in-c, pk/rebase-in-c, pk/rebase-in-c-2-basic, pk/rebase-in-c-3-acts, pk/rebase-in-c-4-opts and pk/rebase-in-c-5-test; is tangled with ag/sequencer-reduce-rewriting-todo, jc/rebase-in-c-5-test-typofix, js/rebase-i-break and js/rebase-i-shortopt.)

 The final step of rewriting "rebase -i" in C.

 Will merge to 'master'.

* pw/add-p-select (2018-07-26) 4 commits
 - add -p: optimize line selection for short hunks
 - add -p: allow line selection to be inverted
 - add -p: select modified lines correctly
 - add -p: select individual hunk lines

 "git add -p" interactive interface learned to let users choose
 individual added/removed lines to be used in the operation, instead
 of accepting or rejecting a whole hunk.

 Will discard.
 No further feedbacks on the topic for quite some time.

 I found the feature to be hard to explain, and may result in more
 end-user complaints, but let's see.
