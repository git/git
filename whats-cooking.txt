What's cooking in git.git (May 2020, #03; Fri, 8)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

I have been a bit more aggressive than usual in merging topics down
to 'next' and 'master' this week, in preparation for -rc0, scheduled
on the 14th.  We may need to apply last-minute fixes to some of
these topics but let's hope that we can keep them to the minimum.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

[Graduated to "master"]

* ah/userdiff-markdown (2020-05-02) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-05-05 at b8e64b75d0)
 + userdiff: support Markdown

 The userdiff patterns for Markdown documents have been added.


* bc/doc-credential-helper-value (2020-05-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-05-07 at de685cea7b)
 + docs: document credential.helper allowed values

 Doc update.


* cb/avoid-colliding-with-netbsd-hmac (2020-05-05) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-05-06 at 5cccb0e1a8)
 + builtin/receive-pack: avoid generic function name hmac()

 The <stdlib.h> header on NetBSD brings in its own definition of
 hmac() function (eek), which conflicts with our own and unrelated
 function with the same name.  Our function has been renamed to work
 around the issue.


* cb/credential-store-ignore-bogus-lines (2020-05-02) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-05-05 at 5b919ec5d6)
 + credential-store: ignore bogus lines from store file
 + credential-store: document the file format a bit more

 With the recent tightening of the code that is used to parse
 various parts of a URL for use in the credential subsystem, a
 hand-edited credential-store file causes the credential helper to
 die, which is a bit too harsh to the users.  Demote the error
 behaviour to just ignore and keep using well-formed lines instead.


* cb/t0000-use-the-configured-shell (2020-05-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-05-07 at c5db4882c4)
 + t/t0000-basic: make sure subtests also use TEST_SHELL_PATH

 The basic test did not honor $TEST_SHELL_PATH setting, which has
 been corrected.


* cb/test-bash-lineno-fix (2020-05-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-05-07 at 8c07e52d2f)
 + t/test_lib: avoid naked bash arrays in file_lineno

 Recent change to show files and line numbers of a breakage during
 test (only available when running the tests with bash) were hurting
 other shells with syntax errors, which has been corrected.


* dl/doc-stash-remove-mention-of-reflog (2020-05-05) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-05-06 at 8b570b7722)
 + Doc: reference the "stash list" in autostash docs

 Doc update.


* dl/switch-c-option-in-error-message (2020-04-30) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-05-05 at 472db48735)
 + switch: fix errors and comments related to -c and -C

 In error messages that "git switch" mentions its option to create a
 new branch, "-b/-B" options were shown, where "-c/-C" options
 should be, which has been corrected.


* ds/sparse-allow-empty-working-tree (2020-05-04) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-05-06 at de7b38aee5)
 + sparse-checkout: stop blocking empty workdirs

 The sparse-checkout patterns have been forbidden from excluding all
 paths, leaving an empty working tree, for a long time.  This
 limitation has been lifted.


* es/restore-staged-from-head-by-default (2020-05-05) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-05-06 at c4abf9b5df)
 + restore: default to HEAD when combining --staged and --worktree

 "git restore --staged --worktree" now defaults to take the contents
 out of "HEAD", instead of erring out.


* jk/arith-expansion-coding-guidelines (2020-05-04) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-05-06 at 2325148249)
 + CodingGuidelines: drop arithmetic expansion advice to use "$x"

 The coding guideline for shell scripts instructed to refer to a
 variable with dollar-sign inside arithmetic expansion to work
 around a bug in old versions of dash, which is a thing of the past.
 Now we are not forbidden from writing $((var+1)).


* jk/credential-sample-update (2020-05-01) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-05-06 at c72ed30ee5)
 + gitcredentials(7): make shell-snippet example more realistic
 + gitcredentials(7): clarify quoting of helper examples

 The samples in the credential documentation has been updated to
 make it clear that we depict what would appear in the .git/config
 file, by adding appropriate quotes as needed..


* jk/for-each-ref-multi-key-sort-fix (2020-05-04) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-05-06 at f4e4ca3cb4)
 + ref-filter: apply fallback refname sort only after all user sorts
 + ref-filter: apply --ignore-case to all sorting keys

 "git branch" and other "for-each-ref" variants accepted multiple
 --sort=<key> options in the increasing order of precedence, but it
 had a few breakages around "--ignore-case" handling, and tie-breaking
 with the refname, which have been fixed.


* jt/commit-graph-plug-memleak (2020-05-04) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-05-06 at 0f80a2b561)
 + commit-graph: avoid memory leaks

 Fix a leak noticed by fuzzer.

 Random bits of FAQ.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ss/faq-fetch-pull (2020-05-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-05-07 at d57224374e)

 Random bits of FAQ.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/auto-gc-quiet (2020-05-07) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-05-07 at 6cc69513c3)
 + auto-gc: pass --quiet down from am, commit, merge and rebase
 + auto-gc: extract a reusable helper from "git fetch"

 Teach "am", "commit", "merge" and "rebase", when they are run with
 the "--quiet" option, to pass "--quiet" down to "gc --auto".

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jt/t5500-unflake (2020-05-06) 1 commit
 - t5500: count objects through stderr, not trace

 Test fix for a topic already in 'master' and meant for 'maint'.

 Expecting an update to clarify the log message.
 Otherwise the change itself looked good.


* jk/ci-only-on-selected-branches (2020-05-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-05-07 at f3227dd3d3)
 + ci: allow per-branch config for GitHub Actions

 Instead of always building all branches at GitHub via Actions,
 users can specify which branches to build.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* cc/upload-pack-v2-fetch-fix (2020-05-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-05-08 at d26b87d06d)
 + upload-pack: clear filter_options for each v2 fetch command

 Serving a "git fetch" client over "git://" and "ssh://" protocols
 using the on-wire protocol version 2 was buggy on the server end
 when the client needs to make a follow-up request to
 e.g. auto-follow tags.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* cw/bisect-replay-with-dos (2020-05-08) 1 commit
 - bisect: allow CRLF line endings in "git bisect replay" input

 "git bisect replay" had trouble with input files when they used
 CRLF line ending, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* dd/bloom-sparse-fix (2020-05-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-05-08 at 1067403c01)
 + bloom: fix `make sparse` warning

 Code clean-up.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ds/sparse-updates-oob-access-fix (2020-05-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-05-08 at fd007758ea)
 + unpack-trees: avoid array out-of-bounds error

 The code to skip unmerged paths in the index when sparse checkout
 is in use would have made out-of-bound access of the in-core index
 when the last path was unmerged, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* hn/refs-cleanup (2020-05-08) 4 commits
 - t: use update-ref and show-ref to reading/writing refs
 - refs: document how ref_iterator_advance_fn should handle symrefs
 - Iterate over the "refs/" namespace in for_each_[raw]ref
 - refs.h: clarify reflog iteration order
 (this branch is used by hn/reftable.)

 Preliminary clean-ups around refs API.

 Needs minor rework but otherwise looks ready.
 I splitted these out of the hn/reftable topic, hoping that these
 should be easier to polish and merge quickly than the rest of the
 series.


* jc/codingstyle-compare-with-null (2020-05-08) 1 commit
 - CodingGuidelines: do not ==/!= compare with 0 or '\0' or NULL

 Doc update.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 Rewriting various parts of "git submodule" in C continues.

 Will merge to 'master'.

* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2018-10-15) 1 commit
 - zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

* js/rebase-autosquash-double-fixup-fix (2020-05-05) 1 commit
 - rebase --autosquash: fix a potential segfault

 "rebase -i" segfaulted when rearranging a sequence that has a
 fix-up that applies another fix-up (which may or may not be a
 fix-up of yet another step).

 Expecting a bit more explanation in the log message.

 + pack-bitmap.c: support 'tree:0' filtering
 + pack-bitmap.c: make object filtering functions generic

* dr/push-remoteref-fix (2020-04-23) 1 commit
 - remote.c: fix handling of %(push:remoteref)

 The "%(push:remoteref)" placeholder in the "--format=" argument of
 "git format-patch" (and friends) only showed what got explicitly
 configured, not what ref at the receiving end would be updated when
 "git push" was used, as it ignored the default behaviour (e.g. update
 the same ref as the source).

 Expecting a reroll.
 cf. <20200416152145.wp2zeibxmuyas6y6@feanor>


* pw/rebase-i-more-options (2020-04-29) 5 commits

 "git receive-pack" that accepts requests by "git push" learned to
 outsource most of the ref updates to the new "proc-receive" hook.

 Needs review.

 - Add some reftable testing infrastructure
 - vcxproj: adjust for the reftable changes

 A new refs backend "reftable" to replace the traditional
 combination of packed-refs files and one-file-per-ref loose refs
 has been implemented and integrated for improved performance and
 atomicity.

 Needs review.

 . credential-store: document the file format a bit more

 Now has become a part of Carlo's credential-store fix patches.


* js/ci-skip-on-github-workflow (2020-05-02) 1 commit
 . ci: respect the [skip ci] convention in our GitHub workflow "CI/PR"

 Allow contributors to mark a branch/push that it does not have to
 be built via GitHub actions, in a way similar to how Travis lets
 them mark the commits with an embedded "[skip ci]" string.

 Superseded by dd/ci-only-on-selective-branches topic.


* dd/ci-only-on-selective-branches (2020-05-05) 2 commits
 - CI: limit GitHub Actions to designated branches
 - SubmittingPatches: advertise GitHub Actions CI

 Instead of always building all branches of all forks of our project
 at GitHub via GitHub Actions, only build when branches with known
 and specific names are updated, and also a pull request.
