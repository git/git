Subject: What's cooking in git.git (Apr 2019, #02; Wed, 10)
X-master-at: e35b8cb8e212e3557efc565157ceb5cbaaf0d87f

What's cooking in git.git (Apr 2019, #02; Wed, 10)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

Sorry for keeping a rather huge backlog for the past few weeks.  As
the result, tonight's pushout is a rather large one, merging 30+
topics to 'next' and a dozen or so to 'master'.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

* ar/t4150-remove-cruft (2019-03-13) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-03-20 at a0106a8d5c)
 + t4150: remove unused variable

 Test cleanup.


* dl/ignore-docs (2019-03-08) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-03-20 at f1f50c07ef)
 + docs: move core.excludesFile from git-add to gitignore
 + git-clean.txt: clarify ignore pattern files

 Doc update.


* dl/reset-doc-no-wrt-abbrev (2019-03-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-03-20 at 984b4586c7)
 + git-reset.txt: clarify documentation

 Doc update.


* ja/dir-rename-doc-markup-fix (2019-03-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-03-20 at f3238df381)
 + Doc: fix misleading asciidoc formating

 Doc update.


* jh/resize-convert-scratch-buffer (2019-03-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-03-20 at 92a24b29ed)
 + convert: avoid malloc of original file size

 When the "clean" filter can reduce the size of a huge file in the
 working tree down to a small "token" (a la Git LFS), there is no
 point in allocating a huge scratch area upfront, but the buffer is
 sized based on the original file size.  The convert mechanism now
 allocates very minimum and reallocates as it receives the output
 from the clean filter process.


* jk/line-log-with-patch (2019-03-11) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-03-20 at 21afea908c)
 + line-log: detect unsupported formats
 + line-log: suppress diff output with "-s"

 "git log -L<from>,<to>:<path>" with "-s" did not suppress the patch
 output as it should.  This has been corrected.


* jk/promote-ggg (2019-03-13) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-03-20 at 3db7d2566d)
 + point pull requesters to GitGitGadget

 Suggest GitGitGadget instead of submitGit as a way to submit
 patches based on GitHub PR to us.


* jk/sha1dc (2019-03-13) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-03-20 at 969280e8e5)
 + Makefile: fix unaligned loads in sha1dc with UBSan

 Build update for SHA-1 with collision detection.


* js/rebase-deprecate-preserve-merges (2019-03-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-03-20 at 32baac3acd)
 + rebase: deprecate --preserve-merges

 "git rebase --rebase-merges" replaces its old "--preserve-merges"
 option; the latter is now marked as deprecated.


* jt/submodule-fetch-errmsg (2019-03-14) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-03-20 at a6b0efa76f)
 + submodule: explain first attempt failure clearly

 Error message update.
 cf. <20190313175738.252961-1-jonathantanmy@google.com> (v2)


* ms/worktree-add-atomic-mkdir (2019-03-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-03-20 at ded442ed02)
 + worktree: fix worktree add race

 "git worktree add" used to do a "find an available name with stat
 and then mkdir", which is race-prone.  This has been fixed by using
 mkdir and reacting to EEXIST in a loop.


* nd/rewritten-ref-is-per-worktree (2019-03-08) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-03-20 at 5369a2e1f6)
 + Make sure refs/rewritten/ is per-worktree
 + files-backend.c: reduce duplication in add_per_worktree_entries_to_dir()
 + files-backend.c: factor out per-worktree code in loose_fill_ref_dir()

 "git rebase" uses the refs/rewritten/ hierarchy to store its
 intermediate states, which inherently makes the hierarchy per
 worktree, but it didn't quite work well.


* ra/t3600-test-path-funcs (2019-03-08) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-03-20 at 404110d291)
 + t3600: use helpers to replace test -d/f/e/s <path>
 + t3600: modernize style
 + test functions: add function `test_file_not_empty`

[New Topics]

* bs/sendemail-tighten-anything-by (2019-04-04) 1 commit
 - send-email: don't cc *-by lines with '-' prefix

 The recently added feature to add addresses that are on
 anything-by: trailers in 'git send-email' was found to be way too
 eager and considered nonsense strings as if they can be legitimate
 beginning of *-by: trailer.  This has been tightened.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* da/smerge (2019-04-04) 2 commits
 - contrib/completion: add smerge to the mergetool completion candidates
 - mergetools: add support for smerge (Sublime Merge)

 "git mergetool" learned to offer Sublime Merge (smerge) as one of
 its backends.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* dl/flex-str-cocci (2019-04-04) 2 commits
 - cocci: FLEX_ALLOC_MEM to FLEX_ALLOC_STR
 - midx.c: convert FLEX_ALLOC_MEM to FLEX_ALLOC_STR

 Code clean-up.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* dl/warn-tagging-a-tag (2019-04-09) 2 commits
 - tag: advise on nested tags
 - tag: fix formatting

 "git tag" learned to give an advice suggesting it might be a
 mistake when creating an annotated or signed tag that points at
 another tag.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jc/format-patch-delay-message-id (2019-04-05) 1 commit
 - format-patch: move message-id and related headers to the end

 The location "git format-patch --thread" adds the Message-Id:
 header in the series of header fields has been moved down, which
 may help working around a suspected bug in GMail MSA, reported at
 <CAHk-=whP1stFZNAaJiMi5eZ9rj0MRt20Y_yHVczZPH+O01d+sA@mail.gmail.com>

 Waiting for feedback to see if it truly helps.
 Needs tests.


* jk/revision-rewritten-parents-in-prio-queue (2019-04-04) 1 commit
 - revision: use a prio_queue to hold rewritten parents

 Performance fix for "rev-list --parents -- pathspec".

 Will merge to 'next'.


* tb/unexpected (2019-04-05) 7 commits
 - rev-list: detect broken root trees
 - rev-list: let traversal die when --missing is not in use
 - get_commit_tree(): return NULL for broken tree
 - list-objects.c: handle unexpected non-tree entries
 - list-objects.c: handle unexpected non-blob entries
 - t: introduce tests for unexpected object types
 - t: move 'hex2oct' into test-lib-functions.sh

 Code tightening against a "wrong" object appearing where an object
 of a different type is expected, instead of blindly assuming that
 the connection between objects are correctly made.

 Waiting for a reroll.

* en/merge-directory-renames (2019-04-08) 15 commits
 - merge-recursive: switch directory rename detection default
 - merge-recursive: give callers of handle_content_merge() access to contents
 - merge-recursive: track information associated with directory renames
 - t6043: fix copied test description to match its purpose
 - merge-recursive: switch from (oid,mode) pairs to a diff_filespec
 - merge-recursive: cleanup handle_rename_* function signatures
 - merge-recursive: track branch where rename occurred in rename struct
 - merge-recursive: remove ren[12]_other fields from rename_conflict_info
 - merge-recursive: shrink rename_conflict_info
 - merge-recursive: move some struct declarations together
 - merge-recursive: use 'ci' for rename_conflict_info variable name
 - merge-recursive: rename locals 'o' and 'a' to 'obuf' and 'abuf'
 - merge-recursive: rename diff_filespec 'one' to 'o'
 - merge-recursive: rename merge_options argument from 'o' to 'opt'
 - Use 'unsigned short' for mode, like diff_filespec does

 "git merge-recursive" backend recently learned a new heuristics to
 infer file movement based on how other files in the same directory
 moved.  As this is inherently less robust heuristics than the one
 based on the content similarity of the file itself (rather than
 based on what its neighbours are doing), it sometimes gives an
 outcome unexpected by the end users.  This has been toned down to
 leave the renamed paths in higher/conflicted stages in the index so
 that the user can examine and confirm the result.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 Code clean-up around a much-less-important-than-it-used-to-be
 update_server_info() funtion.

 Will merge to 'next' after squashing the SQUASH?? in.


* js/rev-list-exclude-promisor-objects (2019-04-09) 1 commit
 - rev-list: exclude promisor objects at walk time

 "git rev-list --exclude-promisor-objects" learned not to bother
 enumerating all promisor objects, and instead filter these objects
 at walk time for performance.

 Docfix.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sg/blame-in-bare-start-at-head (2019-04-08) 1 commit
 - blame: default to HEAD in a bare repo when no start commit is given

 "git blame -- path" in a non-bare repository starts blaming from
 the working tree, and the same command in a bare repository errors
 out because there is no working tree by definition.  The command
 has been taught to instead start blaming from the commit at HEAD,
 which is more useful.

* ss/msvc-path-utils-fix (2019-04-09) 1 commit
 - MSVC: include compat/win32/path-utils.h for MSVC, too, for real_path()

 An earlier update for MinGW and Cygwin accidentally broke MSVC build,
 which has been fixed.

 Waiting for the final version.


* js/add-i-coalesce-after-editing-hunk (2018-08-28) 1 commit

 coalesce small pack files that are still in use.

 Comments?


* js/protocol-advertise-multi (2018-12-28) 1 commit
 - protocol: advertise multiple supported versions

 The transport layer has been updated so that the protocol version
 used can be negotiated between the parties, by the initiator
 listing the protocol versions it is willing to talk, and the other
 side choosing from one of them.

 Expecting a reroll.

 - zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".


* dl/remote-save-to-push (2018-12-11) 1 commit
 - remote: add --save-to-push option to git remote set-url

 "git remote set-url" learned a new option that moves existing value
 of the URL field to pushURL field of the remote before replacing
 the URL field with a new value.

 Anybody who wants to champion this topic?
 I am personally not yet quite convinced if this is worth pursuing.

* cc/replace-graft-peel-tags (2019-04-01) 4 commits
 - replace: fix --graft when passing a tag first
 - replace: fix --graft when passing a tag as parent
 - t6050: redirect expected error output to a file
 - t6050: use test_line_count instead of wc -l

 When given a tag that points at a commit-ish, "git replace --graft"
 failed to peel the tag before writing a replace ref, which did not
 make sense because the old graft mechanism the feature wants to
 mimick only allowed to replace one commit object with another.
 This has been fixed.

 The title of the top two commits are fairly useless and does not
 say how the issue was fixed, but the fix is to peel the given tag
 ourselves down to the underlying commit object.

 - tests (status): spell out the `--find-renames` option in full
 - tests (push): do not abbreviate the `--follow-tags` option

 - tests (rebase): spell out the `--force-rebase` option
 - tests (rebase): spell out the `--keep-empty` option
 (this branch is tangled with dl/rebase-i-keep-base.)

 The tests have been updated not to rely on the abbreviated option
 names the parse-options API offers, to protect us from an
 abbreviated form of an option that used to be unique within the
 command getting non-unique when a new option that share the same
 prefix is added.

 - dir: do not traverse repositories with no commits
 - t3009: test that ls-files -o traverses bogus repo
 - t3000: move non-submodule repo test to separate file
 - submodule: refuse to add repository with no commits

 Running "git add" on a repository created inside the current
 repository is an explicit indication that the user wants to add it
 as a submodule, but when the HEAD of the inner repository is on an
 unborn branch, it cannot be added as a submodule.  Worse, the files
 in its working tree can be added as if they are a part of the outer
 repository, which is not what the user wants.  These problems are
 being addressed.

 Expecting a reroll.

 "git checkout -m <other>" was about carrying the differences

 + curl: anonymize URLs in error messages and warnings
 (this branch is used by js/remote-curl-i18n.)

 remote-http transport did not anonymize URLs reported in its error
 messages at places.

 Will merge to 'master'.

* nd/worktree-name-sanitization (2019-03-20) 2 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - worktree add: sanitize worktree names

 In recent versions of Git, per-worktree refs are exposed in
 refs/worktrees/<wtname>/ hierarchy, which means that worktree names
 must be a valid refname component.  The code now sanitizes the names
 given to worktrees, to make sure these refs are well-formed.


* bp/post-index-change-hook (2019-02-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-03-11 at cb96d1d7c4)
 + read-cache: add post-index-change hook

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2019-02-23

 A new hook "post-index-change" is called when the on-disk index
 file changes, which can help e.g. a virtualized working tree
 implementation.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* jc/format-patch-error-check (2019-02-22) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-10 at 6ca358b7ef)
 + format-patch: notice failure to open cover letter for writing
 + builtin/log: downcase the beginning of error messages
 (this branch is used by jc/format-patch-noclobber.)

 "git format-patch" used overwrite an existing patch/cover-letter
 file.  A new "--no-clobber" option stops it.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* dl/submodule-set-branch (2019-02-08) 3 commits
 - submodule: teach set-branch subcommand
 - submodule--helper: teach config subcommand --unset
 - git-submodule.txt: "--branch <branch>" option defaults to 'master'

 "git submodule" learns "set-branch" subcommand that allows the
 submodule.*.branch settings to be modified.

 Needs sign-off on the tip commit; other than that it seems OK to be in 'next'.


* dm/some-stdio-functions-are-macro-on-freebsd (2019-02-01) 1 commit
 - http: cast result to FILE *

 Variants of BSD define fileno(fh) as a macro, breaking a program
 that passes a "void *" to it.

 Expecting a reroll.

 - Merge branch 'bc/sha-256' into ds/commit-graph-format-v2

 Introduce version 2 of the commit-graph format to correct
 deficiency in the initial version.

 Needs update before merging to 'next'.


* br/blame-ignore (2019-04-04) 6 commits

 - blame: add the ability to ignore commits and their changes
 - blame: optionally track the line starts during fill_blame_origin()
 - blame: use a helper function in blame_chunk()
 - Move init_skiplist() outside of fsck

 "git blame" learned to "ignore" commits in the history, whose
 effects (as well as their presence) get ignored.

 Expecting a reroll.

 - commit: extract cleanup_mode functions to sequencer
 - t7502: clean up style
 - t7604: clean up style
 - t3507: clean up style
 - t7600: clean up style

 The list of conflicted paths shown in the editor while concluding a
 conflicted merge was shown above the scissors line when the
 clean-up mode is set to "scissors", even though it was commented
 out just like the list of updated paths and other information to
 help the user explain the merge better.

 Needs review.

* jn/unknown-index-extensions (2018-11-21) 2 commits
 - index: offer advice for unknown index extensions
 - index: do not warn about unrecognized extensions

 A bit too alarming warning given when unknown index extensions
 exist is getting revamped.

 Expecting a reroll.


* ag/sequencer-reduce-rewriting-todo (2019-03-07) 18 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-10 at 7eab7c7800)

 + sequencer: refactor transform_todos() to work on a todo_list
 + sequencer: remove the 'arg' field from todo_item
 + sequencer: make the todo_list structure public
 + sequencer: changes in parse_insn_buffer()
 (this branch is used by pw/rebase-i-internal-rfc.)

 The scripted version of "git rebase -i" wrote and rewrote the todo
 list many times during a single step of its operation, and the
 recent C-rewrite made a faithful conversion of the logic to C.  The
 implementation has been updated to carry necessary information
 around in-core to avoid rewriting the same file over and over
 unnecessarily.

 Will merge to 'master'.
