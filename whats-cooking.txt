What's cooking in git.git (Dec 2011, #04; Tue, 13)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with '+' are in
'next'.

Here are the repositories that have my integration branches:

With maint, master, next, pu, todo:

        git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git
        git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git
        https://code.google.com/p/git-core/
        https://github.com/git/git

With only maint and master:

        git://git.sourceforge.jp/gitroot/git-core/git.git
        git://git-core.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/git-core/git-core

With all the topics and integration branches:

        https://github.com/gitster/git

The preformatted documentation in HTML and man format are found in:

        git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-{htmldocs,manpages}.git/
        git://repo.or.cz/git-{htmldocs,manpages}.git/

Not ready. At least pack-objects and fsck need to learn the new encoding
for the series to be usable locally, and then index-pack/unpack-objects
needs to learn it to be used remotely.

 + Merge branch 'nd/maint-ignore-exclude' into nd/ignore-might-be-precious

Will merge to 'master'.

* jk/upload-archive-use-start-command (2011-11-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-12-09 at 88cb83a)

  (merged to 'next' on 2011-12-09 at d0fd605)

 + finish_tmp_packfile(): a helper function
 + create_tmp_packfile(): a helper function
 + write_pack_header(): a helper function
 (this branch is used by jc/split-blob.)

Teaches "git add" to send large-ish blob data straight to a packfile.
This is a continuation to the "large file support" topic. The codepath to
move data from worktree to repository is made aware of streaming, just
like the checkout codepath that goes the other way, which was done in the
previous "large file support" topic in the 1.7.7 cycle.

Replaces a series from Kato Kazuyoshi on the same topic.

Will merge to 'master'.
