What's cooking in git.git (Aug 2023, #03; Tue, 8)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and
aren't considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL
to a message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity (of course they can be resubmit when new interests
arise).

There are some last-minute fixes that update or add messages that
are marked for i18n, and they may have to be fast-tracked to -rc1,
which we may want to delay by one day for that reason.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

Release tarballs are available at:

* am/doc-sha256 (2023-07-31) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2023-08-01 at d7419bf527)
 + doc: sha256 is no longer experimental

 Tone down the warning on SHA-256 repositories being an experimental
 curiosity.  We do not have support for them to interoperate with
 traditional SHA-1 repositories, but at this point, we do not plan
 to make breaking changes to SHA-256 repositories and there is no
 longer need for such a strongly phrased warning.

 a branch that is checked out and protect it.  Rephrase the message
 to say that the branch is in use.
