What's cooking in git.git (Nov 2020, #02; Mon, 9)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'seen' (formerly 'pu'---proposed updates) while commits prefixed
with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

The third and fourth batches of topics in this cycle are in 'master' now,
including some microprojects by candidates for the Outreachy
program.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into.  Some repositories have
only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

Release tarballs are available at:

 of the fsmonitor data when available.


* pb/ref-filter-with-crlf (2020-10-29) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-10-30 at 8be77584c5)
 + log, show: add tests for messages containing CRLF
 + ref-filter: handle CRLF at end-of-line more gracefully

 A commit and tag object may have CR at the end of each and
 every line (you can create such an object with hash-object or
 using --cleanup=verbatim to decline the default clean-up
 action), but it would make it impossible to have a blank line
 to separate the title from the body of the message.  Be lenient
 and accept a line with lone CR on it as a blank line, too.

 "git format-patch" (and friends) only showed what got explicitly
 configured, not what ref at the receiving end would be updated when
 "git push" was used, as it ignored the default behaviour (e.g. update
 the same ref as the source).

 Discard for now.

* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2018-10-15) 1 commit
 - zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

 + sequencer: tolerate abbreviated stopped-sha file

 Recently the format of an internal state file "rebase -i" uses has
 been tightened up for consistency, which would hurt those who start
 "rebase -i" with old git and then continue with new git.  Loosen
 the reader side a bit (which we may want to tighten again in a year
 or so).

* sj/untracked-files-in-submodule-directory-is-not-dirty (2020-10-26) 1 commit
 - diff: do not show submodule with untracked files as "-dirty"

 "git diff" showed a submodule working tree with untracked cruft as
 "Submodule commit <objectname>-dirty", but a natural expectation is
 that the "-dirty" indicator would align with "git describe --dirty",
 which does not consider having untracked files in the working tree
 as source of dirtiness.  The inconsistency has been fixed.

 Needs doc update and also adjusting "git status".

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2020-10-23

 "git fsck" and the corresponding check done during the transport
 learned to ensure that in-tree files like `.gitignore` and
 `.gitattributes` are not symbolic links.

 It seems that there are real projects with .gitignore recorded as
 symlinks, which may need to loosen the fsck setting.  Do we need
 to introduce a class that is separate from symlinked .gitmodules
 that probably is with potential consequences that is more grave?
