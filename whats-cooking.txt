What's cooking in git.git (May 2013, #05; Mon, 20)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.

The final version of 1.8.3 is expected to be tagged late this week.
While applying a few regression hot-fix patches, a couple of benign
doc updates have also been merged to 'master'.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* dw/asciidoc-sources-are-dot-txt-files (2013-05-10) 1 commit
 - CodingGuidelines: Documentation/*.txt are the sources


* fc/doc-style (2013-05-09) 1 commit

 - remote-bzr: trivial cleanups
 - remote-bzr: change global repo
 - remote-bzr: delay cloning/pulling
 - remote-bzr: simplify get_remote_branch()
 - remote-bzr: fix for files with spaces
 - remote-bzr: recover from failed clones

 The ones near the tip conflicted with the hotfix for 1.8.3 so I
 discarded them for now.

 - test: add t7301 for git-clean--interactive
 - git-clean: add documentation for interactive git-clean

 - git-clean: show items of del_list in columns
 - git-clean: add support for -i/--interactive
 - git-clean: refactor git-clean into two phases

* tr/test-v-and-v-subtest-only (2013-05-16) 6 commits
 - test-lib: support running tests under valgrind in parallel

 Allows N instances of tests run in parallel, each running 1/N parts
 of the test suite under Valgrind, to speed things up.

 The tip one may be useful in practice but is a tad ugly ;-)
 

* rh/merge-options-doc-fix (2013-05-16) 1 commit
 - Documentation/merge-options.txt: restore `-e` option

 Even though it is not all that urgent, this can be merged to
 'master' before the final,

[Stalled]

* mh/multimail (2013-04-21) 1 commit
 - git-multimail: a replacement for post-receive-email

 Waiting for the initial history to pull from.
 $gmane/223564


* jc/format-patch (2013-04-22) 2 commits
 - format-patch: --inline-single
 - format-patch: rename "no_inline" field

 A new option to send a single patch to the standard output to be
 appended at the bottom of a message.  I personally have no need for
 this, but it was easy enough to cobble together.  Tests, docs and
 stripping out more MIMEy stuff are left as exercises to interested
 parties.

 Not ready for inclusion.


* jk/gitweb-utf8 (2013-04-08) 4 commits
 - gitweb: Fix broken blob action parameters on blob/commitdiff pages
 - gitweb: Don't append ';js=(0|1)' to external links
 - gitweb: Make feed title valid utf8
 - gitweb: Fix utf8 encoding for blob_plain, blobdiff_plain, commitdiff_plain, and patch

 Various fixes to gitweb.

 Waiting for a reroll after a review.


* jk/commit-info-slab (2013-04-19) 3 commits
 - commit-slab: introduce a macro to define a slab for new type
 - commit-slab: avoid large realloc
 - commit: allow associating auxiliary info on-demand
 (this branch is used by jc/show-branch.)

 Technology demonstration to show a way we could use unbound number
 of flag bits on commit objects.


* jn/config-ignore-inaccessible (2013-04-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-05-07 at 4f09e24)
 + config: allow inaccessible configuration under $HOME

 When $HOME is misconfigured to point at an unreadable directory, we
 used to complain and die. This loosens the check.

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

 - imap-send: eliminate HMAC deprecation warnings on Mac OS X
 - cache.h: eliminate SHA-1 deprecation warnings on Mac OS X
 - Makefile: add support for Apple CommonCrypto facility

 I think this is ready for 'next'; not that it matters during the
 prerelease feature freeze.


* fc/macos-x-clipped-write (2013-05-17) 1 commit
 - compate/clipped-write.c: large write(2) fails on Mac OS X/XNU

* hv/config-from-blob (2013-05-12) 5 commits
 - do not die when error in config parsing of buf occurs
 - teach config --blob option to parse config from database
 - config: make parsing stack struct independent from actual data source
 - config: drop cf validity check in get_next_char()
 - config: factor out config file stack management


* jc/t5551-posix-sed-bre (2013-05-12) 1 commit
 - t5551: do not use unportable sed '\+'

 I think this is ready for 'next'; not that it matters during the
 prerelease feature freeze.


* jk/fetch-always-update-tracking (2013-05-12) 4 commits
 - fetch: opportunistically update tracking refs
 - refactor "ref->merge" flag
 - fetch/pull doc: untangle meaning of bare <ref>
 - t5510: start tracking-ref tests from a known state

 "git fetch origin master" unlike "git fetch origin" or "git fetch"
 does not update "refs/remotes/origin/master" and it was an early
 design decision to keep the update of remote tracking branches
 predictable, but in practice it turns out that people find it more
 convenient to opportunisticly update them whenever we have a
 chance, and we have been updating them when we run "git push" which
 already breaks the original "predictability" anyway.

 I think this is ready for 'next'; not that it matters during the
 prerelease feature freeze.


* nd/clone-connectivity-shortcut (2013-05-11) 4 commits
 - clone: open a shortcut for connectivity check
 - index-pack: remove dead code (it should never happen)
 - fetch-pack: prepare updated shallow file before fetching the pack
 - clone: let the user know when check_everything_connected is run


* rr/rebase-autostash (2013-05-12) 7 commits
 - rebase: implement --[no-]autostash and rebase.autostash
 - rebase --merge: return control to caller, for housekeeping
 - rebase -i: return control to caller, for housekeeping
 - am: return control to caller, for housekeeping
 - rebase: prepare to do generic housekeeping
 - rebase -i: don't error out if $state_dir already exists
 - am: tighten a conditional that checks for $dotest


* kb/ancestry-path-threedots (2013-05-16) 2 commits
 - revision.c: treat A...B merge bases as if manually specified
 - t6019: demonstrate --ancestry-path A...B breakage
 (this branch is used by kb/full-history-compute-treesame-carefully-2.)

 I think this is ready for 'next'; not that it matters during the
 prerelease feature freeze.


* kb/full-history-compute-treesame-carefully-2 (2013-05-16) 15 commits
 - revision.c: make default history consider bottom commits
 - revision.c: don't show all merges for --parents
 - revision.c: discount side branches when computing TREESAME
 - revision.c: add BOTTOM flag for commits
 - simplify-merges: drop merge from irrelevant side branch

 - revision.c: Make --full-history consider more merges
 - Documentation: avoid "uninteresting"
 - rev-list-options.txt: correct TREESAME for P
 - t6111: add parents to tests
 - t6111: allow checking the parents as well
 - t6111: new TREESAME test set
 - t6019: test file dropped in -s ours merge
 - decorate.c: compact table when growing
 (this branch uses kb/ancestry-path-threedots.)

 Major update to a very core part of the system to improve culling
 of irrelevant parents while traversing a mergy history.

 Will not be a 1.8.3 material, but is an important topic.


* jc/strbuf-branchname-fix (2013-05-16) 1 commit
 - strbuf_branchname(): do not double-expand @{-1}~22

 "git merge @{-1}~22" was rewritten to "git merge frotz@{1}~22"
 incorrectly when your previous branch was "frotz" (it should be
 rewritten to "git merge frotz~22" instead).


* mk/combine-diff-context-horizon-fix (2013-05-15) 1 commit
 - combine-diff.c: Fix output when changes are exactly 3 lines apart

 "git diff -c -p" was not showing a deleted line from a hunk when
 another hunk immediately begins where the earlier one ends.

 I think this is ready for 'next'; not that it matters during the
 prerelease feature freeze.


* mm/color-auto-default (2013-05-15) 2 commits
 - make color.ui default to 'auto'
 - config: refactor management of color.ui's default value

 Flip the default for color.ui to 'auto', which is what many
 tutorials recommend new users to do.

 I think this is ready for 'next', but we may want to audit
 tutorials to see if we need to adjust them if they suggest to set
 color.ui as the first thing to do when they meet Git.


* tr/coverage (2013-05-13) 4 commits
 - coverage: build coverage-untested-functions by default
 - coverage: set DEFAULT_TEST_TARGET to avoid using prove
 - coverage: do not delete .gcno files before building
 - coverage: split build target into compile and test

 Update the test coverage support that was left to bitrot for some
 time.

 I think this is ready for 'next'; not that it matters during the
 prerelease feature freeze.


* mg/more-textconv (2013-05-10) 7 commits
 - grep: honor --textconv for the case rev:path
 - grep: allow to use textconv filters
 - t7008: demonstrate behavior of grep with textconv
 - cat-file: do not die on --textconv without textconv filters
 - show: honor --textconv for blobs
 - diff_opt: track whether flags have been set explicitly
 - t4030: demonstrate behavior of show with textconv

 I think this is ready for 'next'; not that it matters during the
 prerelease feature freeze.


* jh/shorten-refname (2013-05-07) 4 commits
 - t1514: refname shortening is done after dereferencing symbolic refs
 - shorten_unambiguous_ref(): Fix shortening refs/remotes/origin/HEAD to origin
 - t1514: Demonstrate failure to correctly shorten "refs/remotes/origin/HEAD"
 - t1514: Add tests of shortening refnames in strict/loose mode

 When remotes/origin/HEAD is not a symbolic ref, "rev-parse
 --abbrev-ref remotes/origin/HEAD" ought to show "origin", not
 "origin/HEAD", which is fixed with this series (if it is a symbolic
 ref that points at remotes/origin/something, then it should show
 "origin/something" and it already does).

 I think this is being rerolled using strbuf_expand().


* nd/clone-local-with-colon (2013-05-07) 1 commit
 - clone: allow cloning local paths with colons in them

 "git clone foo/bar:baz" cannot be a request to clone from a remote
 over git-over-ssh specified in the scp style.  Detect this case and
 clone from a local repository at "foo/bar:baz".

 I think this is ready for 'next'; not that it matters during the
 prerelease feature freeze.


* nd/warn-ambiguous-object-name (2013-05-07) 1 commit
 - get_sha1: improve ambiguity warning regarding SHA-1 and ref names

 "git cmd <name>", when <name> happens to be a 40-hex string,
 directly uses the 40-hex string as an object name, even if a ref
 "refs/<some hierarchy>/<name>" exists.  This disambiguation order
 is unlikely to change, but we should warn about the ambiguity just
 like we warn when more than one refs/ hierachies share the same
 name.

 The message needs to be fixed up, as this is not "refname is
 ambiguous".


* fc/zsh-leftover-bits (2013-05-08) 2 commits
 - completion: synchronize zsh wrapper
 - completion: cleanup zsh wrapper

 I think this is ready for 'next'; not that it matters during the
 prerelease feature freeze.


* rs/empty-archive (2013-05-09) 2 commits
 - t5004: resurrect original empty tar archive test
 - t5004: avoid using tar for checking emptiness of archive

 Fixes tests added in 1.8.2 era that are broken on BSDs,
 but it is not all that urgent.

 I think this is ready for 'next'; not that it matters during the
 prerelease feature freeze.


* vv/help-unknown-ref (2013-05-08) 2 commits
 - merge: use help_unknown_ref()
 - help: add help_unknown_ref()

 Detect "git merge foo" that might have meant "git merge origin/foo"
 and give an error message that is more specific than "foo is not
 something we can merge".

 I think this is ready for 'next'; not that it matters during the
 prerelease feature freeze.


* fc/fast-export-persistent-marks (2013-05-07) 3 commits
 - fast-{import,export}: use get_sha1_hex() to read from marks file
 - fast-export: don't parse commits while reading marks file
 - fast-export: do not parse non-commit objects while reading marks file

 Optimization for fast-export by avoiding unnecessarily resolving
 arbitrary object name and parsing object when only presence and
 type information is necessary, etc.

 I think this is ready for 'next'; not that it matters during the
 prerelease feature freeze.


* jc/core-checkstat-2.0 (2013-05-06) 2 commits
 - core.statinfo: remove as promised in Git 2.0
 - deprecate core.statinfo at Git 2.0 boundary

 The bottom one is a fix for a breakage of a new feature in 1.8.2
 but it is not all that urgent.


* jk/packed-refs-race (2013-05-06) 4 commits
 - for_each_ref: load all loose refs before packed refs
 - get_packed_refs: reload packed-refs file when it changes
 - add a stat_validity struct
 - resolve_ref: close race condition for packed refs


* fc/at-head (2013-05-08) 13 commits
 - sha1_name: compare variable with constant, not constant with variable
 - Add new @ shortcut for HEAD
 - sha1_name: refactor reinterpret()
 - sha1_name: check @{-N} errors sooner
 - sha1_name: reorganize get_sha1_basic()
 - sha1_name: don't waste cycles in the @-parsing loop
 - sha1_name: remove unnecessary braces
 - sha1_name: remove no-op
 - tests: at-combinations: @{N} versus HEAD@{N}
 - tests: at-combinations: increase coverage
 - tests: at-combinations: improve nonsense()
 - tests: at-combinations: check ref names directly
 - tests: at-combinations: simplify setup

 Instead of typing four capital letters "HEAD", you can say "@"
 instead.


* jk/lookup-object-prefer-latest (2013-05-02) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-05-06 at cc59dcc)
 + lookup_object: prioritize recently found objects

 Optimizes object lookup when the object hashtable starts to become
 crowded.


* jk/subtree-do-not-push-if-split-fails (2013-05-01) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-05-06 at 81bdf37)
 + contrib/subtree: don't delete remote branches if split fails

 "git subtree" (in contrib/) had one codepath with loose error
 checks to lose data at the remote side.


* fc/completion (2013-04-27) 9 commits
 - completion: remove __git_index_file_list_filter()
 - completion: add space after completed filename
 - completion: add hack to enable file mode in bash < 4
 - completion: refactor __git_complete_index_file()
 - completion: refactor diff_index wrappers
 - completion: use __gitcompadd for __gitcomp_file
 - completion; remove unuseful comments
 - completion: document tilde expansion failure in tests
 - completion: add file completion tests

 I think this is ready for 'next'; not that it matters during the
 prerelease feature freeze.


* jk/test-output (2013-05-06) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-05-06 at 7c03af3)
 + t/Makefile: don't define TEST_RESULTS_DIRECTORY recursively
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-05-01 at 63827c9)
 + test output: respect $TEST_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
 + t/Makefile: fix result handling with TEST_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY

 When TEST_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY setting is used, it was handled somewhat
 inconsistently between the test framework and t/Makefile, and logic
 to summarize the results looked at a wrong place.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* rj/mingw-cygwin (2013-05-08) 2 commits
 - cygwin: Remove the CYGWIN_V15_WIN32API build variable
 - mingw: rename WIN32 cpp macro to GIT_WINDOWS_NATIVE

 Update build for Cygwin 1.[57].  There seems to be an ongoing
 discussion on the list.


* rj/sparse (2013-04-28) 10 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-05-01 at 649e16c)

 + compat/regex/regexec.c: Fix some sparse warnings

 Will cook in 'next'.


* js/transport-helper-error-reporting-fix (2013-04-28) 13 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-29 at 8cc4bb8)
 + git-remote-testgit: build it to run under $SHELL_PATH
 + git-remote-testgit: further remove some bashisms
 + git-remote-testgit: avoid process substitution
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-25 at 3358f1a)
 + t5801: "VAR=VAL shell_func args" is forbidden
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-22 at 5ba6467)
 + transport-helper: update remote helper namespace
 + transport-helper: trivial code shuffle
 + transport-helper: warn when refspec is not used
 + transport-helper: clarify pushing without refspecs
 + transport-helper: update refspec documentation
 + transport-helper: clarify *:* refspec
 + transport-helper: improve push messages
 + transport-helper: mention helper name when it dies
 + transport-helper: report errors properly
 (this branch is tangled with fc/transport-helper-error-reporting.)

 Finishing touches to fc/transport-helper-error-reporting topic.
 Will cook in 'next'.


* mh/fetch-into-shallow (2013-05-02) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-05-03 at 3fadc61)
 + t5500: add test for fetching with an unknown 'shallow'
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-29 at a167d3e)
 + upload-pack: ignore 'shallow' lines with unknown obj-ids

 Will cook in 'next'.


* jh/checkout-auto-tracking (2013-04-21) 8 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-22 at 2356700)
 + glossary: Update and rephrase the definition of a remote-tracking branch
 + branch.c: Validate tracking branches with refspecs instead of refs/remotes/*
 + t9114.2: Don't use --track option against "svn-remote"-tracking branches
 + t7201.24: Add refspec to keep --track working
 + t3200.39: tracking setup should fail if there is no matching refspec.
 + checkout: Use remote refspecs when DWIMming tracking branches
 + t2024: Show failure to use refspec when DWIMming remote branch names
 + t2024: Add tests verifying current DWIM behavior of 'git checkout <branch>'

 Updates "git checkout foo" that DWIMs the intended "upstream" and
 turns it into "git checkout -t -b foo remotes/origin/foo" to
 correctly take existing remote definitions into account.  The
 remote "origin" may be what uniquely map its own branch to
 remotes/some/where/foo but that some/where may not be "origin".

 Will cook in 'next'.


* jc/prune-all (2013-04-25) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-26 at 97a7387)
 + prune: introduce OPT_EXPIRY_DATE() and use it
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-22 at b00ccf6)
 + api-parse-options.txt: document "no-" for non-boolean options
 + git-gc.txt, git-reflog.txt: document new expiry options
 + date.c: add parse_expiry_date()
 (this branch is used by mh/packed-refs-various.)

 We used the approxidate() parser for "--expire=<timestamp>" options
 of various commands, but it is better to treat --expire=all and
 --expire=now a bit more specially than using the current timestamp.
 Update "git gc" and "git reflog" with a new parsing function for
 expiry dates.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* as/check-ignore (2013-04-29) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-30 at 646931f)
 + t0008: use named pipe (FIFO) to test check-ignore streaming
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-21 at 7515aa8)
 + Documentation: add caveats about I/O buffering for check-{attr,ignore}
 + check-ignore: allow incremental streaming of queries via --stdin
 + check-ignore: move setup into cmd_check_ignore()
 + check-ignore: add -n / --non-matching option
 + t0008: remove duplicated test fixture data

 Enhance "check-ignore" (1.8.2 update) to work more like "check-attr"
 over bidi-pipes.

 Will cook in 'next'.
