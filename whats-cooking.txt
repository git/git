What's cooking in git.git (Apr 2010, #06; Sat, 17)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones
marked with '.' do not appear in any of the integration branches, but I am
still holding onto them.

I'll soon be tagging 1.7.1-rc2; please test 'master', report & fix
regressions.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* jc/doc-submit-gmail (2010-04-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-10 at cd4e8cf)
 + SubmittingPatches: update GMail section

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* rr/remote-helper-doc (2010-04-07) 3 commits
 - Documentation/remote-helpers: Add invocation section
 - Documentation/urls: Rewrite to accomodate <transport>::<address>
 - Documentation/remote-helpers: Rewrite description

I'd like acks or rewrites from transport people on this topic.

* js/rebase-origin-x (2010-02-05) 1 commit
 - [RFC w/o test and incomplete] rebase: add -x option to record original commit name

I retract my objection against the idea of -x; needs polishing before
moving forward.

* js/grep-open (2010-03-26) 2 commits
 - grep -O: allow optional argument specifying the pager (or editor)
 - grep: Add the option '--open-files-in-pager'
 (this branch is used by jp/hold-string-list-sanity.)

Probably needs to support --no-index mode as well.

* jp/hold-string-list-sanity (2010-04-06) 9 commits
 . string_list: Fix argument order for string_list_append
 . Merge branch 'sr/remote-helper-export' into HEAD
 . Merge branch 'js/grep-open' into HEAD
 . Merge branch 'sb/fmt-merge-msg' into HEAD
 . string_list: Fix argument order for string_list_lookup
 . string_list: Fix argument order for string_list_insert_at_index
 . string_list: Fix argument order for string_list_insert
 . string_list: Fix argument order for for_each_string_list
 . string_list: Fix argument order for print_string_list
 (this branch uses js/grep-open and sr/remote-helper-export.)

Building this on top of slushy codebase is not a very promising endeavor.
Good thing to do, but bad timing.

 - am -3: recover the diagnostic messages for corrupt patches

* jc/maint-no-reflog-expire-unreach-for-head (2010-04-09) 3 commits
 - reflog --expire-unreachable: special case entries in "HEAD" reflog
 - more war on "sleep" in tests
 - Document gc.<pattern>.reflogexpire variables
 (this branch uses jc/maint-reflog-expire-unreachable.)

Rerolled; instead of ignoring the configuration like the previous round
did, this one prunes stale entries that are unreachable from any ref from
the reflog of HEAD.

* cw/maint-exec-defpath (2010-04-15) 2 commits
 - autoconf: Check if <paths.h> exists and set HAVE_PATHS_H
 - exec_cmd.c: replace hard-coded path list with one from <paths.h>

There are gitk patches that go with this series.

 - describe: Break annotated tag ties by tagger date
 - tag.c: Parse tagger date (if present)
 - tag.c: Refactor parse_tag_buffer to be saner to program

  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-14 at a393c0b)
 + apply: Allow blank *trailing* context lines to match beyond EOF

* bg/send-email-smtpdomain (2010-04-10) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-14 at 88fff99)

 + Document send-email --smtp-domain
 + send-email: Don't use FQDNs without a '.'
 + send-email: Cleanup { style

* rc/ls-remote-default (2010-04-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-14 at d5081bd)
 + ls-remote: fall-back to default remotes when no remote specified

* rc/maint-curl-helper (2010-04-08) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-14 at 2eb9177)

* hg/maint-attr-fix (2010-04-06) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-14 at a27c7d7)
 + attr: Expand macros immediately when encountered.

 - status: --ignored option shows ignored files
 - wt-status: rename and restructure status-print-untracked
 - wt-status: collect ignored files
 - wt-status: plug memory leak while collecting untracked files
 - wt-status: remove unused workdir_untracked member

This is merely an illustration patch.  I am negative about conflating the
JSON output to the mix at this point.  If we are going to add JSON option
to everywhere we would generate "machine readable" output with the -z
and/or --porcelain options, that is fine, but let's stabilize "status"
with the existing --porcelain/-z option first.

* eb/unpretty-b-format (2010-03-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-07 at 7f5c112)
 + Add `%B' in format strings for raw commit body in `git log' and friends

  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-07 at 701e863)

  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-07 at 8ccf40a)
 + war on "sleep" in tests

 (this branch is used by jc/maint-no-reflog-expire-unreach-for-head.)

* np/malloc-threading (2010-04-08) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-10 at e1730fb)
 + Thread-safe xmalloc and xrealloc needs a recursive mutex
 + Make xmalloc and xrealloc thread-safe

The fix should eventually go to 'maint' and 'master'.  This queues the one
from J6t for Windows compatibility.

* js/async-thread (2010-03-09) 7 commits
 - Enable threaded async procedures whenever pthreads is available
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-03-20 at 9939243)
 + Dying in an async procedure should only exit the thread, not the process.
 + Reimplement async procedures using pthreads
 + Windows: more pthreads functions
 + Fix signature of fcntl() compatibility dummy
 + Make report() from usage.c public as vreportf() and use it.
 + Modernize t5530-upload-pack-error.

Been waiting for resolution of locking issues in malloc-threading.

* sd/log-decorate (2010-04-08) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-08 at 68fee56)

  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-06 at 992c9ad)

 + Add `log.decorate' configuration variable.
 + git_config_maybe_bool()

  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-05 at 0e64aac)
 + t7508: add a test for "git status" in a read-only repository
 + git status: refresh the index if possible
 + t7508: add test for "git status" refreshing the index

* cw/ws-indent-with-tab (2010-04-03) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-05 at 5b5e579)
 + whitespace: tests for git-apply --whitespace=fix with tab-in-indent

 + whitespace: replumb ws_fix_copy to take a strbuf *dst instead of char *dst
 + whitespace: tests for git-diff --check with tab-in-indent error class

 (this branch is used by jp/hold-string-list-sanity.)

* cc/revert-strategy (2010-03-31) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-05 at 50909c1)
 + revert: add "--strategy" option to choose merge strategy
 + merge: make function try_merge_command non static
 + merge: refactor code that calls "git merge-STRATEGY"
 + revert: refactor merge recursive code into its own function
 + revert: use strbuf to refactor the code that writes the merge message

This is more about debugging and we are not in a great hurry.

* sc/http-late-auth (2010-04-01) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-02 at c991acf)
 + Prompt for a username when an HTTP request 401s

 + make commit_tree a library function

The small leak fixes in the beginning of the series has been merged to
'master' after a minor fixup.

* ld/discovery-limit-to-fs (2010-04-04) 6 commits
 - write-index: check and warn when worktree crosses a filesystem boundary
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-07 at 11ea09a)

 + GIT_ONE_FILESYSTEM: flip the default to stop at filesystem boundaries
 + Add support for GIT_ONE_FILESYSTEM
 + truncate cwd string before printing error message
 + config.c: remove static keyword from git_env_bool()

The tip one is a bit iffy; the whole series changes behaviour in a corner
case, and is not a 1.7.1 material.

* pc/remove-warn (2010-03-26) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-02 at 52fc00d)
 + Remove a redundant errno test in a usage of remove_path
 + Introduce remove_or_warn function
 + Implement the rmdir_or_warn function
 + Generalise the unlink_or_warn function

I cherry-picked only obviously sensible bits.

* em/checkout-orphan (2010-03-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-03-28 at 86b6a4f)
 + git checkout: create unparented branch by --orphan

Perhaps needs a bit of documentation updates, describing the "going open
source" scenario.

  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-07 at e50fd3a)
