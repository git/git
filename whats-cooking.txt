What's cooking in git.git (Aug 2018, #05; Mon, 20)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

An early preview of the upcoming 2.19 release of Git has been tagged
as v2.19.0-rc0; before -rc1, I plan to merge three more topics to
'master' from 'next'.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

  (merged to 'next' on 2018-08-15 at c6a740d828)
 + t7406: avoid using test_must_fail for commands other than git
 + t7406: prefer test_* helper functions to test -[feds]
 + t7406: avoid having git commands upstream of a pipe
 + t7406: simplify by using diff --name-only instead of diff --raw
 + t7406: fix call that was failing for the wrong reason

 Test fixes.


* en/update-index-doc (2018-08-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-08-15 at 3ee0ae14dc)
 + git-update-index.txt: reword possibly confusing example

 Doc update.


* es/chain-lint-more (2018-08-13) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-08-15 at bb5150ee96)
 + chainlint: add test of pathological case which triggered false positive

 + chainlint: let here-doc and multi-line string commence on same line
 + chainlint: recognize multi-line $(...) when command cuddled with "$("
 + chainlint: match 'quoted' here-doc tags
 + chainlint: match arbitrary here-docs tags rather than hard-coded names

 Improve built-in facility to catch broken &&-chain in the tests.


* hn/highlight-sideband-keywords (2018-08-18) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-08-20 at ec6f953f8c)
 + sideband: do not read beyond the end of input
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-08-15 at f8945f3be5)
 + sideband: highlight keywords in remote sideband output

 The sideband code learned to optionally paint selected keywords at
 the beginning of incoming lines on the receiving end.


* jc/gpg-status (2018-08-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-08-15 at 824781761a)
 + gpg-interface: propagate exit status from gpg back to the callers

 "git verify-tag" and "git verify-commit" have been taught to use
 the exit status of underlying "gpg --verify" to signal bad or
 untrusted signature they found.


* jc/update-index-doc (2018-08-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-08-15 at 055994ccca)
 + update-index: there no longer is `apply --index-info`

 Doc update.


* jh/partial-clone-doc (2018-08-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-08-15 at cf09e8be6a)
 + partial-clone: render design doc using asciidoc

 Doc updates.


* jk/for-each-object-iteration (2018-08-14) 11 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-08-15 at e2558810ff)
 + for_each_*_object: move declarations to object-store.h
 + cat-file: use a single strbuf for all output
 + cat-file: split batch "buf" into two variables
 + cat-file: use oidset check-and-insert
 + cat-file: support "unordered" output for --batch-all-objects
 + cat-file: rename batch_{loose,packed}_object callbacks
 + t1006: test cat-file --batch-all-objects with duplicates
 + for_each_packed_object: support iterating in pack-order
 + for_each_*_object: give more comprehensive docstrings
 + for_each_*_object: take flag arguments as enum
 + for_each_*_object: store flag definitions in a single location

 The API to iterate over all objects learned to optionally list
 objects in the order they appear in packfiles, which helps locality
 of access if the caller accesses these objects while as objects are
 enumerated.


* js/chain-lint-attrfix (2018-08-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-08-15 at e9ad19a848)
 + chainlint: fix for core.autocrlf=true

 Test fix.


* js/mingw-o-append (2018-08-13) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-08-15 at 284527a0fb)
 + mingw: enable atomic O_APPEND

 Among the three codepaths we use O_APPEND to open a file for
 appending, one used for writing GIT_TRACE output requires O_APPEND
 implementation that behaves sensibly when multiple processes are
 writing to the same file.  POSIX emulation used in the Windows port
 has been updated to improve in this area.


* js/range-diff (2018-08-13) 21 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-08-15 at 8d56067806)
 + range-diff: use dim/bold cues to improve dual color mode
 + range-diff: make --dual-color the default mode
 + range-diff: left-pad patch numbers
 + completion: support `git range-diff`
 + range-diff: populate the man page
 + range-diff --dual-color: skip white-space warnings
 + range-diff: offer to dual-color the diffs
 + diff: add an internal option to dual-color diffs of diffs
 + color: add the meta color GIT_COLOR_REVERSE
 + range-diff: use color for the commit pairs
 + range-diff: add tests
 + range-diff: do not show "function names" in hunk headers
 + range-diff: adjust the output of the commit pairs
 + range-diff: suppress the diff headers
 + range-diff: indent the diffs just like tbdiff
 + range-diff: right-trim commit messages
 + range-diff: also show the diff between patches
 + range-diff: improve the order of the shown commits
 + range-diff: first rudimentary implementation
 + Introduce `range-diff` to compare iterations of a topic branch
 + linear-assignment: a function to solve least-cost assignment problems
 (this branch is used by es/format-patch-rangediff and sb/range-diff-colors.)

 "git tbdiff" that lets us compare individual patches in two
 iterations of a topic has been rewritten and made into a built-in
 command.


* js/rebase-merges-exec-fix (2018-08-09) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-08-15 at 9de975d92d)
 + rebase --exec: make it work with --rebase-merges
 + t3430: demonstrate what -r, --autosquash & --exec should do

 The "--exec" option to "git rebase --rebase-merges" placed the exec
 commands at wrong places, which has been corrected.


* js/typofixes (2018-08-08) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-08-15 at ce3932254a)
 + remote-curl: remove spurious period
 + git-compat-util.h: fix typo

 Comment update.


* jt/commit-graph-per-object-store (2018-08-13) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-08-15 at 5d6db738d8)
 + t5318: avoid unnecessary command substitutions

 Test update.


* jt/fetch-negotiator-skipping (2018-08-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-08-15 at 3cf8fa32f5)
 + t5552: suppress upload-pack trace output

 Test fix.


* jt/repack-promisor-packs (2018-08-09) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-08-17 at 6869b53a69)
 + repack: repack promisor objects if -a or -A is set
 + repack: refactor setup of pack-objects cmd

 After a partial clone, repeated fetches from promisor remote would
 have accumulated many packfiles marked with .promisor bit without
 getting them coalesced into fewer packfiles, hurting performance.
 "git repack" now learned to repack them.


* nd/cherry-pick-quit-fix (2018-08-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-08-17 at b270179855)
 + cherry-pick: fix --quit not deleting CHERRY_PICK_HEAD

 "git cherry-pick --quit" failed to remove CHERRY_PICK_HEAD even
 though we won't be in a cherry-pick session after it returns, which
 has been corrected.


* nd/no-the-index (2018-08-13) 24 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-08-15 at 41e53dc53b)
 + blame.c: remove implicit dependency on the_index
 + apply.c: remove implicit dependency on the_index
 + apply.c: make init_apply_state() take a struct repository
 + apply.c: pass struct apply_state to more functions
 + resolve-undo.c: use the right index instead of the_index
 + archive-*.c: use the right repository
 + archive.c: avoid access to the_index
 + grep: use the right index instead of the_index
 + attr: remove index from git_attr_set_direction()
 + entry.c: use the right index instead of the_index
 + submodule.c: use the right index instead of the_index
 + pathspec.c: use the right index instead of the_index
 + unpack-trees: avoid the_index in verify_absent()
 + unpack-trees: convert clear_ce_flags* to avoid the_index
 + unpack-trees: don't shadow global var the_index
 + unpack-trees: add a note about path invalidation
 + unpack-trees: remove 'extern' on function declaration
 + ls-files: correct index argument to get_convert_attr_ascii()
 + preload-index.c: use the right index instead of the_index
 + dir.c: remove an implicit dependency on the_index in pathspec code
 + convert.c: remove an implicit dependency on the_index
 + attr: remove an implicit dependency on the_index
 + cache-tree: wrap the_index based wrappers with #ifdef
 + diff.c: move read_index() code back to the caller

 The more library-ish parts of the codebase learned to work on the
 in-core index-state instance that is passed in by their callers,
 instead of always working on the singleton "the_index" instance.


* ng/mergetool-lose-final-prompt (2018-08-13) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-08-15 at f8f7ac365b)
 + mergetool: don't suggest to continue after last file

 "git mergetool" stopped and gave an extra prompt to continue after
 the last path has been handled, which did not make much sense.


* pw/rebase-i-merge-segv-fix (2018-08-16) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-08-17 at c8823e4511)
 + rebase -i: fix SIGSEGV when 'merge <branch>' fails
 + t3430: add conflicting commit

 "git rebase -i", when a 'merge <branch>' insn in its todo list
 fails, segfaulted, which has been (minimally) corrected.


* pw/rebase-i-squash-number-fix (2018-08-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-08-17 at ac54dfa51a)
 + rebase -i: fix numbering in squash message

 When "git rebase -i" is told to squash two or more commits into
 one, it labeled the log message for each commit with its number.
 It correctly called the first one "1st commit", but the next one
 was "commit #1", which was off-by-one.  This has been corrected.


* sb/config-write-fix (2018-08-08) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-08-17 at 7d9c7ce81f)
 + git-config: document accidental multi-line setting in deprecated syntax
 + config: fix case sensitive subsection names on writing
 + t1300: document current behavior of setting options

 Recent update to "git config" broke updating variable in a
 subsection, which has been corrected.


* sb/pull-rebase-submodule (2018-08-14) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-08-15 at 07c7b55cc9)
 + git-submodule.sh: accept verbose flag in cmd_update to be non-quiet

 "git pull --rebase -v" in a repository with a submodule barfed as
 an intermediate process did not understand what "-v(erbose)" flag
 meant, which has been fixed.


* sb/submodule-cleanup (2018-08-16) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-08-17 at ca9d8aaef4)
 + builtin/submodule--helper: remove stray new line
 + t7410: update to new style

 A few preliminary minor clean-ups in the area around submodules.


* sg/t5310-empty-input-fix (2018-08-14) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-08-15 at c3c03973a0)
 + t5310-pack-bitmaps: fix bogus 'pack-objects to file can use bitmap' test

 Test fix.


* sk/instaweb-rh-update (2018-08-08) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-08-15 at ce5f1115e9)
 + git-instaweb: fix apache2 config with apache >= 2.4
 + git-instaweb: support Fedora/Red Hat apache module path

 "git instaweb" has been adjusted to run better with newer Apache on
 RedHat based distros.


* wc/make-funnynames-shared-lazy-prereq (2018-08-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-08-17 at b932a0894b)
 + t: factor out FUNNYNAMES as shared lazy prereq

 A test prerequisite defined by various test scripts with slightly
 different semantics has been consolidated into a single copy and
 made into a lazily defined one.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* sl/commit-dry-run-with-short-output-fix (2018-07-30) 4 commits
 . commit: fix exit code when doing a dry run
 . wt-status: teach wt_status_collect about merges in progress
 . wt-status: rename commitable to committable
 . t7501: add coverage for flags which imply dry runs

 "git commit --dry-run" gave a correct exit status even during a
 conflict resolution toward a merge, but it did not with the
 "--short" option, which has been corrected.

 Seems to break 7512, 3404 and 7060 in 'pu'.


* ma/wrapped-info (2018-05-28) 2 commits
 - usage: prefix all lines in `vreportf()`, not just the first
 - usage: extract `prefix_suffix_lines()` from `advise()`

 An attempt to help making multi-line messages fed to warning(),
 error(), and friends more easily translatable.

 Will discard and wait for a cleaned-up rewrite.
 cf. <20180529213957.GF7964@sigill.intra.peff.net>


* hn/bisect-first-parent (2018-04-21) 1 commit
 - bisect: create 'bisect_flags' parameter in find_bisection()

 Preliminary code update to allow passing more flags down the
 bisection codepath in the future.

 We do not add random code that does not have real users to our
 codebase, so let's have it wait until such a real code materializes
 before too long.


* av/fsmonitor-updates (2018-01-04) 6 commits
 - fsmonitor: use fsmonitor data in `git diff`
 - fsmonitor: remove debugging lines from t/t7519-status-fsmonitor.sh
 - fsmonitor: make output of test-dump-fsmonitor more concise
 - fsmonitor: update helper tool, now that flags are filled later
 - fsmonitor: stop inline'ing mark_fsmonitor_valid / _invalid
 - dir.c: update comments to match argument name

 Code clean-up on fsmonitor integration, plus optional utilization
 of the fsmonitor data in diff-files.

 Waiting for an update.
 cf. <alpine.DEB.2.21.1.1801042335130.32@MININT-6BKU6QN.europe.corp.microsoft.com>


* pb/bisect-helper-2 (2018-07-23) 8 commits
 - t6030: make various test to pass GETTEXT_POISON tests
 - bisect--helper: `bisect_start` shell function partially in C
 - bisect--helper: `get_terms` & `bisect_terms` shell function in C
 - bisect--helper: `bisect_next_check` shell function in C
 - bisect--helper: `check_and_set_terms` shell function in C
 - wrapper: move is_empty_file() and rename it as is_empty_or_missing_file()
 - bisect--helper: `bisect_write` shell function in C
 - bisect--helper: `bisect_reset` shell function in C

 Expecting a reroll.
 cf. <0102015f5e5ee171-f30f4868-886f-47a1-a4e4-b4936afc545d-000000@eu-west-1.amazonses.com>

 I just rebased the topic to a newer base as it did not build
 standalone with the base I originally queued the topic on, but
 otherwise there is no update to address any of the review comments
 in the thread above---we are still waiting for a reroll.


* jk/drop-ancient-curl (2017-08-09) 5 commits
 - http: #error on too-old curl
 - curl: remove ifdef'd code never used with curl >=7.19.4
 - http: drop support for curl < 7.19.4
 - http: drop support for curl < 7.16.0
 - http: drop support for curl < 7.11.1

 Some code in http.c that has bitrot is being removed.

 Expecting a reroll.


* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2017-08-10) 1 commit
 . zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

 Needs resurrecting by making sure the fix is good and still applies
 (or adjusted to today's codebase).

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* ep/worktree-quiet-option (2018-08-17) 1 commit
 - worktree: add --quiet option

 "git worktree" command learned "--quiet" option to make it less
 verbose.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* nd/config-core-checkstat-doc (2018-08-17) 1 commit
 - config.txt: clarify core.checkStat

 The meaning of the possible values the "core.checkStat"
 configuration variable can take were not adequately documented,
 which has been fixed.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sm/branch-sort-config (2018-08-16) 1 commit
 - branch: support configuring --sort via .gitconfig

 "git branch --list" learned to take the default sort order from the
 'branch.sort' configuration variable, just like "git tag --list"
 pays attention to 'tag.sort'.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ab/unconditional-free-and-null (2018-08-17) 1 commit
 - refactor various if (x) FREE_AND_NULL(x) to just FREE_AND_NULL(x)

 Code clean-up.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* bp/checkout-new-branch-optim (2018-08-16) 1 commit
 - checkout: optimize "git checkout -b <new_branch>"

 "git checkout -b newbranch [HEAD]" should not have to do as much as
 checking out a commit different from HEAD.  An attempt is made to
 optimize this special case.

 So... what is the status of this thing?  Is the other "optimize
 unpack-trees" effort turning out to be a safer and less hacky way
 to achieve similar gain and this no longer is needed?


* ao/submodule-wo-gitmodules-checked-out (2018-08-14) 7 commits
 - submodule: support reading .gitmodules even when it's not checked out
 - t7506: clean up .gitmodules properly before setting up new scenario
 - submodule: use the 'submodule--helper config' command
 - submodule--helper: add a new 'config' subcommand
 - t7411: be nicer to future tests and really clean things up
 - submodule: factor out a config_set_in_gitmodules_file_gently function
 - submodule: add a print_config_from_gitmodules() helper

 The submodule support has been updated to read from the blob at
 HEAD:.gitmodules when the .gitmodules file is missing from the
 working tree.

 I find the design a bit iffy in that our usual "missing in the
 working tree?  let's use the latest blob" fallback is to take it
 from the index, not from the HEAD.


* bw/submodule-name-to-dir (2018-08-10) 2 commits
 - submodule: munge paths to submodule git directories
 - submodule: create helper to build paths to submodule gitdirs

 In modern repository layout, the real body of a cloned submodule
 repository is held in .git/modules/ of the superproject, indexed by
 the submodule name.  URLencode the submodule name before computing
 the name of the directory to make sure they form a flat namespace.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* cc/delta-islands (2018-08-16) 7 commits
 - pack-objects: move 'layer' into 'struct packing_data'
 - pack-objects: move tree_depth into 'struct packing_data'
 - t5320: tests for delta islands
 - repack: add delta-islands support
 - pack-objects: add delta-islands support
 - pack-objects: refactor code into compute_layer_order()
 - Add delta-islands.{c,h}

 Lift code from GitHub to restrict delta computation so that an
 object that exists in one fork is not made into a delta against
 another object that does not appear in the same forked repository.

 What's the doneness of this topic?


* md/filter-trees (2018-08-16) 6 commits
 - list-objects-filter: implement filter tree:0
 - revision: mark non-user-given objects instead
 - rev-list: handle missing tree objects properly
 - list-objects: always parse trees gently
 - list-objects: refactor to process_tree_contents
 - list-objects: store common func args in struct

 The "rev-list --filter" feature learned to exclude all trees via
 "tree:0" filter.


* ng/status-i-short-for-ignored (2018-08-09) 1 commit
 - status: -i shorthand for --ignored command line option


* pk/rebase-in-c-2-basic (2018-08-10) 11 commits

 With "rebase -i" machinery being rewritten to C, with a different
 interface between "rebase" proper and its backends, this and the
 other topics need a bit more work to play with each other better.

* nd/clone-case-smashing-warning (2018-08-17) 1 commit
 - clone: report duplicate entries on case-insensitive filesystems

 Running "git clone" against a project that contain two files with
 pathnames that differ only in cases on a case insensitive
 filesystem would result in one of the files lost because the
 underlying filesystem is incapable of holding both at the same
 time.  An attempt is made to detect such a case and warn.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* nd/unpack-trees-with-cache-tree (2018-08-18) 7 commits
 - cache-tree: verify valid cache-tree in the test suite
 - unpack-trees: add missing cache invalidation
 - unpack-trees: reuse (still valid) cache-tree from src_index
 - unpack-trees: reduce malloc in cache-tree walk
 - unpack-trees: optimize walking same trees with cache-tree
 - unpack-trees: add performance tracing
 - trace.h: support nested performance tracing

 The unpack_trees() API used in checking out a branch and merging
 walks one or more trees along with the index.  When the cache-tree
 in the index tells us that we are walking a tree whose flattened
 contents is known (i.e. matches a span in the index), as linearly
 scanning a span in the index is much more efficient than having to
 open tree objects recursively and listing their entries, the walk
 can be optimized, which is done in this topic.

 Will merge to and cook in 'next'.


* sb/range-diff-colors (2018-08-14) 8 commits

 - test_decode_color: understand FAINT and ITALIC

 The color output support for recently introduced "range-diff"
 command got tweaked a bit.

 An attempt to unflake a test a bit.


* pw/rebase-i-author-script-fix (2018-08-07) 2 commits
 - sequencer: fix quoting in write_author_script
 - sequencer: handle errors from read_author_ident()

 Recent "git rebase -i" update started to write bogusly formatted
 author-script, with a matching broken reading code.  These are
 being fixed.

 Undecided.
 Is it the list consensus to favor this "with extra code, read the
 script written by bad writer" approach?


* pw/add-p-select (2018-07-26) 4 commits
 - add -p: optimize line selection for short hunks
 - add -p: allow line selection to be inverted
 - add -p: select modified lines correctly
 - add -p: select individual hunk lines

 "git add -p" interactive interface learned to let users choose
 individual added/removed lines to be used in the operation, instead
 of accepting or rejecting a whole hunk.

 Will hold.

  (merged to 'next' on 2018-08-02 at 0ee624e329)
 + commit-graph: close_commit_graph before shallow walk
 + commit-graph: not compatible with uninitialized repo
 + commit-graph: not compatible with grafts
 + commit-graph: not compatible with replace objects
 + test-repository: properly init repo
 + commit-graph: update design document
 + refs.c: upgrade for_each_replace_ref to be a each_repo_ref_fn callback
 + refs.c: migrate internal ref iteration to pass thru repository argument

 The recently introduced commit-graph auxiliary data is incompatible
 with mechanisms such as replace & grafts that "breaks" immutable
 nature of the object reference relationship.  Disable optimizations
 based on its use (and updating existing commit-graph) when these
 incompatible features are in use in the repository.

 Eject and replace with another reroll when it comes.

 The code for computing history reachability has been shuffled,
 obtained a bunch of new tests to cover them, and then being
 improved.

* jn/gc-auto (2018-07-17) 3 commits
 - gc: do not return error for prior errors in daemonized mode
 - gc: exit with status 128 on failure
 - gc: improve handling of errors reading gc.log

 "gc --auto" ended up calling exit(-1) upon error, which has been
 corrected to use exit(1).  Also the error reporting behaviour when
 daemonized has been updated to exit with zero status when stopping
 due to a previously discovered error (which implies there is no
 point running gc to improve the situation); we used to exit with
 failure in such a case.

 Implement lazy fetches of missing objects to complement the

 Ejected; seems to break existing repositories that use partialclone
 repository extension.

 I haven't seen much interest in this topic on list.  What's the
 doneness of this thing?

 I do not particularly mind adding code to support a niche feature
 as long as it is cleanly made and it is clear that the feature
 won't negatively affect those who do not use it, so a review from
 that point of view may also be appropriate.
