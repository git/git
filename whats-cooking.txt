What's cooking in git.git (Aug 2019, #03; Tue, 6)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

There are a few last-minute fix-up topics in flight, which I'll be
merging to 'next' and then down to 'master' soonish, before rc2.
They are marked as "Will merge to 'next' and then to 'master'" in
this report; please raise hand if some of them are not ready or
appropriate, to stop me before too late.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* ds/commit-graph-octopus-fix (2019-08-05) 1 commit
 - commit-graph: fix bug around octopus merges

 commit-graph did not handle commits with more than two parents
 correctly, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next' and then to 'master'.


* mr/doc-can-not-to-cannot (2019-08-05) 1 commit
 - doc: typo: s/can not/cannot/ and s/is does/does/

 Docfix.

 Will merge to 'next' and then to 'master'.


* nd/switch-and-restore (2019-08-05) 1 commit
 - restore: fix typo in docs

 Docfix.

 Will merge to 'next' and then to 'master'.


* sg/commit-graph-validate (2019-08-05) 3 commits
 - commit-graph: error out on invalid commit oids in 'write --stdin-commits'
 - commit-graph: turn a group of write-related macro flags into an enum
 - t5318-commit-graph: use 'test_expect_code'

 The code to write commit-graph over given commit object names has
 been made a bit more robust.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sg/show-failed-test-names (2019-08-05) 2 commits
 - tests: show the test name and number at the start of verbose output
 - t0000-basic: use realistic test script names in the verbose tests

 The first line of verbose output from each test piece now carries
 the test name and number to help scanning with eyeballs.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* en/disable-dir-rename-in-recursive-merge (2019-08-06) 1 commit
 - merge-recursive: avoid directory rename detection in recursive case

 "merge-recursive" hit a BUG() when building a virtual merge base
 detected a directory rename.

 Will merge to 'next' and then to 'master'.


* js/pre-merge-commit-hook (2019-08-06) 4 commits
 - merge: --no-verify to bypass pre-merge-commit hook
 - git-merge: honor pre-merge-commit hook
 - merge: do no-verify like commit
 - t7503: verify proper hook execution

 A new "pre-merge-commit" hook has been introduced.


* ja/l10n-fixes (2019-08-06) 1 commit
 - l10n: reformat some localized strings for v2.23.0

 A few messages have been updated to help localization better.

 Will merge to 'next' and then to 'master'.


* jk/eoo (2019-08-06) 3 commits
 - gitcli: document --end-of-options
 - parse-options: allow --end-of-options as a synonym for "--"
 - revision: allow --end-of-options to end option parsing

 The command line parser learned "--end-of-options" notation; the
 standard convention for scripters to have hardcoded set of options
 first on the command line, and force the command to treat end-user
 input as non-options, has been to use "--" as the delimiter, but
 that would not work for commands that use "--" as a delimiter
 between revs and pathspec.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/repo-init-cleanup (2019-08-06) 3 commits
 - config: stop checking whether the_repository is NULL
 - common-main: delay trace2 initialization
 - t1309: use short branch name in includeIf.onbranch test

 Further clean-up of the initialization code.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* jn/unknown-index-extensions (2018-11-21) 2 commits
 - index: offer advice for unknown index extensions
 - index: do not warn about unrecognized extensions

 A bit too alarming warning given when unknown index extensions
 exist is getting revamped.

 Expecting a reroll.


* jc/format-patch-delay-message-id (2019-04-05) 1 commit
 - format-patch: move message-id and related headers to the end

 The location "git format-patch --thread" adds the Message-Id:
 header in the series of header fields has been moved down, which
 may help working around a suspected bug in GMail MSA, reported at
 <CAHk-=whP1stFZNAaJiMi5eZ9rj0MRt20Y_yHVczZPH+O01d+sA@mail.gmail.com>

 Waiting for feedback to see if it truly helps.
 Needs tests.


* jt/fetch-cdn-offload (2019-03-12) 9 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - upload-pack: send part of packfile response as uri
 - fetch-pack: support more than one pack lockfile
 - upload-pack: refactor reading of pack-objects out
 - Documentation: add Packfile URIs design doc
 - Documentation: order protocol v2 sections
 - http-fetch: support fetching packfiles by URL
 - http: improve documentation of http_pack_request
 - http: use --stdin when getting dumb HTTP pack

 WIP for allowing a response to "git fetch" to instruct the bulk of
 the pack contents to be instead taken from elsewhere (aka CDN).


* js/protocol-advertise-multi (2018-12-28) 1 commit
 - protocol: advertise multiple supported versions

 The transport layer has been updated so that the protocol version
 used can be negotiated between the parties, by the initiator
 listing the protocol versions it is willing to talk, and the other
 side choosing from one of them.

 Expecting a reroll.

* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2018-10-15) 1 commit
 - zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".


* dl/remote-save-to-push (2018-12-11) 1 commit
 - remote: add --save-to-push option to git remote set-url

 "git remote set-url" learned a new option that moves existing value
 of the URL field to pushURL field of the remote before replacing
 the URL field with a new value.

 Anybody who wants to champion this topic?
 I am personally not yet quite convinced if this is worth pursuing.

 + grep: fix worktree case in submodules

 "git grep --recurse-submodules" that looks at the working tree
 files looked at the contents in the index in submodules, instead of
 files in the working tree.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* jk/tree-walk-overflow (2019-08-01) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-08-02 at 116467c77a)

 + tree-walk: add a strbuf wrapper for make_traverse_path()
 + tree-walk: accept a raw length for traverse_path_len()
 + tree-walk: use size_t consistently
 + tree-walk: drop oid from traverse_info
 + setup_traverse_info(): stop copying oid

 Codepaths to walk tree objects have been audited for integer
 overflows and hardened.

 + t5703: run all non-httpd-specific tests before sourcing 'lib-httpd.sh'
 + t5510-fetch: run non-httpd-specific test before sourcing 'lib-httpd.sh'
 (this branch uses sg/t5510-test-i18ngrep-fix.)

 Test fix.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* vn/reset-deleted-ita (2019-07-26) 1 commit
 - reset: unstage empty deleted ita files

 "git reset HEAD [<pathspec>]" did not reset an empty file that was
 added with the intent-to-add bit.

 Expecting a reroll.


* ra/rebase-i-more-options (2019-07-23) 4 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - rebase -i: support --committer-date-is-author-date
 - sequencer: add NULL checks under read_author_script
 - rebase -i: add --ignore-whitespace flag

 "git rebase -i" learned a few options that are known by "git
 rebase" proper.

 Needs a bit of fixups, at least.


* js/rebase-r-strategy (2019-07-31) 16 commits
 - rebase -r: do not (re-)generate root commits with `--root` *and* `--onto`
 - t3418: test `rebase -r` with merge strategies
 - t/lib-rebase: prepare for testing `git rebase --rebase-merges`

 - t3427: simplify the `setup` test case significantly
 - t3427: add a clarifying comment
 - rebase: fold git-rebase--common into the -p backend
 - sequencer: the `am` and `rebase--interactive` scripts are gone
 - .gitignore: there is no longer a built-in `git-rebase--interactive`
 - t3400: stop referring to the scripted rebase
 - Drop unused git-rebase--am.sh

 "git rebase --rebase-merges" learned to drive different merge
 strategies and pass strategy specific options to them.


* js/trace2-json-schema (2019-07-25) 3 commits
 . ci: run trace2 schema validation in the CI suite
 . trace2: add a schema validator for trace2 events
 . trace2: add a JSON schema for trace2 events

 The JSON output produced by "trace2" subsystem now has JSON schema
 defined on it, to allow us validate the output and catch deviation.

 The CI integration may be a bit too heavy-handed.

 + grep: make the behavior for NUL-byte in patterns sane
 + grep tests: move binary pattern tests into their own file
 + grep tests: move "grep binary" alongside the rest
 + grep: inline the return value of a function call used only once
 + t4210: skip more command-line encoding tests on MinGW
 + grep: don't use PCRE2?_UTF8 with "log --encoding=<non-utf8>"
 + log tests: test regex backends in "--encode=<enc>" tests
 (this branch is used by ab/pcre-jit-fixes.)

 Retire use of kwset library, which is an optimization for looking
 for fixed strings, with use of pcre2 JIT.

 Kicked out of 'next' to give the topic a chance to get rebooted.


* ab/pcre-jit-fixes (2019-07-26) 7 commits
 - grep: do not enter PCRE2_UTF mode on fixed matching
 - grep: stess test PCRE v2 on invalid UTF-8 data
 - grep: create a "is_fixed" member in "grep_pat"

 - list-objects-filter: implement composite filters
 - list-objects-filter-options: always supply *errbuf
 - list-objects-filter: put omits set in filter struct
 - list-objects-filter: encapsulate filter components

 The list-objects-filter API (used to create a sparse/lazy clone)
 learned to take a combined filter specification.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* cc/multi-promisor (2019-06-25) 15 commits
 - Move core_partial_clone_filter_default to promisor-remote.c
 - Move repository_format_partial_clone to promisor-remote.c

 Teach the lazy clone machinery that there can be more than one
 promisor remote and consult them in order when downloading missing
 objects on demand.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jc/format-patch-noclobber (2019-02-22) 1 commit
 - format-patch: --no-clobber refrains from overwriting output files

 "git format-patch" used to overwrite an existing patch/cover-letter
 file.  A new "--no-clobber" option stops it.

 Will discard.


* dl/rebase-i-keep-base (2019-04-25) 6 commits
 - rebase: teach rebase --keep-base
 - rebase: fast-forward --fork-point in more cases
 - rebase: fast-forward --onto in more cases
 - rebase: refactor can_fast_forward into goto tower
 - t3432: test rebase fast-forward behavior
 - t3431: add rebase --fork-point tests

 "git rebase --keep-base <upstream>" tries to find the original base
 of the topic being rebased and rebase on top of that same base,
 which is useful when running the "git rebase -i" (and its limited
 variant "git rebase -x").

 The command also has learned to fast-forward in more cases where it
 can instead of replaying to recreate identical commits.

 On hold.
