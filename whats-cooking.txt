What's cooking in git.git (Sep 2010, #02; Mon, 6)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones
marked with '.' do not appear in any of the integration branches, but I am
still holding onto them.

There are a few leftover bits in 'next' that need to be merged to 'master'
before we declare a real -rc cycle, so tonight's pushout is -rc0.

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* ab/compat-regex (2010-08-26) 9 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-08-26 at c5cc9d2)
 + Fix compat/regex ANSIfication on MinGW
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-08-22 at 40bce7c)
 + autoconf: regex library detection typofix
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-08-21 at 632d60f)

 + Change regerror() declaration from K&R style to ANSI C (C89)

This may need a yet another fix-up for MinGW.

* jj/icase-directory (2010-08-16) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-08-26 at 9d8e1bc)
 + Support case folding in git fast-import when core.ignorecase=true
 + Support case folding for git add when core.ignorecase=true
 + Add case insensitivity support when using git ls-files
 + Add case insensitivity support for directories when using git status
 + Case insensitivity support for .gitignore via core.ignorecase
 + Add string comparison functions that respect the ignore_case variable.

Depends on GNU FNM_CASEFOLD.  Presumably a bit of tweak in Makefile for
non-windows but non-GNU platforms is all it takes?

* by/line-log (2010-08-11) 17 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-08-26 at a160ff1)
 + Document line history browser
 + Add tests for line history browser
 + Add --full-line-diff option
 + Add --graph prefix before line history output
 + Add parent rewriting to line history browser

 + Make rewrite_parents public to other part of git
 + Hook line history into cmd_log, ensuring a topo-ordered walk
 + Print the line log
 + map/take range to the parent of commits
 + Add range clone functions
 + Export three functions from diff.c
 + Parse the -L options
 + Refactor parse_loc
 + Add the basic data structure for line level history
 + parse-options: add two helper functions
 + parse-options: enhance STOP_AT_NON_OPTION

There is a reported crash with valgrind trace.  Bo seems to be looking
into it.

* il/rfc-remote-fd-ext (2010-08-26) 7 commits
 - remote-ext/fd style fixup
 - Fix build on Windows
 - Simplify send_git_request()
 - Rewrite bidirectional traffic loop
 - gitignore: Ignore the new /git-remote-{ext,fd} helpers
 - New remote helper: git-remote-ext
 - New remote helper git-remote-fd

Needs a bit of usage illustration (this does not seem to come with any
documentation nor tests).

* zl/mailinfo-recode-patch (2010-06-14) 2 commits
 - add --recode-patch option to git-am
 - add --recode-patch option to git-mailinfo

I recall there was another round of re-roll planned for this one.

* jk/tag-contains (2010-07-05) 4 commits
 - Why is "git tag --contains" so slow?
 - default core.clockskew variable to one day
 - limit "contains" traversals based on commit timestamp
 - tag: speed up --contains calculation

The idea of the bottom one is probably Ok, except that the use of object
flags needs to be rethought, or at least the helper needs to be moved to
builtin/tag.c to make it clear that it should not be used outside the
current usage context.

[Cooking]

* ch/filter-branch-deprecate-remap-to-ancestor (2010-08-27) 1 commit
 - filter-branch: retire --remap-to-ancestor

* ch/maint-cannot-create-bundle-error (2010-08-27) 1 commit
 - bundle: detect if bundle file cannot be created

* rr/format-patch-count-without-merges (2010-08-28) 2 commits
 - format-patch: Don't go over merge commits
 - t4014-format-patch: Call test_tick before committing

* as/daemon-multi-listen (2010-08-29) 2 commits
 - daemon: allow more than one host address given via --listen
 - daemon: add helper function setup_named_sock()

I think the idea is sound.  It came a bit late in the cycle for the next
release and probably needs a bit more polish.

* jc/pickaxe-grep (2010-08-31) 4 commits
 - diff/log -G<pattern>: tests
 - git log/diff: add -G<regexp> that greps in the patch text
 - diff: pass the entire diff-options to diffcore_pickaxe()
 - gitdiffcore doc: update pickaxe description

This is a re-roll of "grepping inside the log -p output" which is a
feature that is often asked for when people hear about -S option.

* jh/error-removing-missing-note (2010-08-31) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-09-04 at 428b078)

Will merge to 'master' shortly.

 + tests: make test_might_fail fail on missing commands
 + tests: make test_might_fail more verbose
 + tests: make test_must_fail fail on missing commands
 + tests: make test_must_fail more verbose

Will merge to 'master' shortly.

* jl/fetch-submodule-recursive (2010-08-30) 2 commits
 - Submodules: Add the new "fetch" config option for fetch and pull
 - fetch/pull: Recursively fetch populated submodules

I think the idea is sound and hopefully the end result will help the heavy
users of subprojects.  It came a bit late in the cycle for the next
release, though.

* kf/askpass-config (2010-08-30) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-09-04 at c49783f)
 + Extend documentation of core.askpass and GIT_ASKPASS.
 + Allow core.askpass to override SSH_ASKPASS.
 + Add a new option 'core.askpass'.

Will merge to 'master' shortly.

* tf/cleanup-builtin-help-headers (2010-08-31) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-09-06 at dbf0d4b)
 + builtin.h: Move two functions definitions to help.h.

* en/object-list-with-pathspec (2010-08-26) 2 commits

 + t/t5510: demonstrate failure to fetch when current branch has merge ref

Will merge to 'master' shortly.

* jf/merge-ignore-ws (2010-08-26) 4 commits
 - merge-recursive: options to ignore whitespace changes
 - merge-recursive --patience
 - ll-merge: replace flag argument with options struct
 - merge-recursive: expose merge options for builtin merge

I think the idea is sound.  It came a bit late in the cycle for the next
release, though.

* jk/maint-pass-c-config-in-env (2010-08-24) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-09-04 at f4ed3ac)
 + do not pass "git -c foo=bar" params to transport helpers
 + pass "git -c foo=bar" params through environment

Will merge to 'master' shortly.

* rr/fmt-merge-msg (2010-08-27) 5 commits
 - t6200-fmt-merge-msg: Exercise '--log' to configure shortlog length
 - t6200-fmt-merge-msg: Exercise 'merge.log' to configure shortlog length
 - merge: Make 'merge.log' an integer or boolean option
 - merge: Make '--log' an integer option for number of shortlog entries
 - fmt_merge_msg: Change fmt_merge_msg API to accept shortlog_len

I think the idea is sound.  It came a bit late in the cycle for the next
release, though.

* tr/merge-unborn-clobber (2010-08-22) 1 commit
 - Exhibit merge bug that clobbers index&WT

* en/tree-walk-optim (2010-08-26) 4 commits
 - diff_tree(): Skip skip_uninteresting() when all remaining paths interesting
 - tree_entry_interesting(): Make return value more specific
 - tree-walk: Correct bitrotted comment about tree_entry()
 - Document pre-condition for tree_entry_interesting

I think the idea is sound.  For a patch that touches fairly core part of
the system, it came a bit late in the cycle, though.

* cb/ignored-paths-are-precious (2010-08-21) 1 commit
 - checkout/merge: optionally fail operation when ignored files need to be overwritten

I fixed up a trivial error in the configuration parser (which didn't
return immediately after parsing), and while at it flipped the default 
value of the configuration and the command line option to false.

This probably needs tests; also we know of longstanding bugs in related
area that needs to be addressed---they do not have to be part of this
series but their reproduction recipe would belong to the test script for
this topic.

It may hurt users to make the new feature on by default, especially the
ones with subdirectories that come and go.  For a patch that changes a
long established semantics, it came a bit late in the cycle, so it will
have to wait until the next release.

* po/etc-gitattributes (2010-09-01) 1 commit
 - Add global and system-wide gitattributes

I think the idea is sound.  For a patch that touches fairly core part of
the system, it came a bit late in the cycle, though.

* gb/shell-ext (2010-08-27) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-08-27 at e1ef3c1)
 + shell: Display errors from improperly-formatted command lines
 + Merge branch 'gb/split-cmdline-errmsg' into gb/shell-ext
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-08-24 at 49ea7b8)
 + shell: Rewrite documentation and improve error message
 + Add sample commands for git-shell
 + Add interactive mode to git-shell for user-friendliness
 + Allow creation of arbitrary git-shell commands

I am not very happy about adding these backdoors to git-shell, which is
primarily a security mechanism, and obviously security and backdoor do not
mix well.

* ab/i18n (2010-08-30) 21 commits
 - gettext tests: test message re-encoding under C
 - po/pl.po: add Polish translation
 - po/is.po: add Icelandic translation
 - po/is.po: msgmerge and add Language: header
 - gettext tests: mark a test message as not needing translation
 - gettext tests: test re-encoding with a UTF-8 msgid under Shell
 - gettext tests: test message re-encoding under Shell
 - gettext tests: add detection for is_IS.ISO-8859-1 locale
 - gettext tests: update test/is.po to match t/t0200/test.c
 - gettext tests: test if $VERSION exists before using it
 - gettext.c: work around us not using setlocale(LC_CTYPE, "")
 - gettext: localize the main git-init message
 - gettext: make the simple parts of git-init localizable
 - builtin.h: Include gettext.h
 - Makefile: use variables and shorter lines for xgettext
 - Makefile: tell xgettext(1) that our source is in UTF-8
 - Makefile: provide a --msgid-bugs-address to xgettext(1)
 - Makefile: A variable for options used by xgettext(1) calls
 - tests: locate i18n lib&data correctly under --valgrind
 - gettext: setlocale(LC_CTYPE, "") breaks Git's C function assumptions
 - Add infrastructure for translating Git with gettext

Kicked back to 'pu' to give it a bit more time to experiment with a
Porcelain command or a two, and an opportunity for a fresh restart if
necessary in the next cycle.
