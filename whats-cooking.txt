What's cooking in git.git (Dec 2020, #01; Tue, 8)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'seen' (formerly 'pu'---proposed updates) while commits prefixed
with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

So far, the master branch accumulated 140+ merges of topic branches
containing 400+ single-parent commits.  We are getting close to -rc0
and it is likely we'd have to keep some topics on 'next', rather
than rushing them to result in a broken release, during the feature
freeze.  We have a bit less than 50 topics in flight, including some
stalled ones, and I expect that we can merge less than half of them
before -rc0.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/

* ab/retire-parse-remote (2020-11-24) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-11-25 at 644484d7df)
 + submodule: fix fetch_in_submodule logic
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-11-18 at 80d4d8290c)
 + parse-remote: remove this now-unused library
 + submodule: remove sh function in favor of helper
 + submodule: use "fetch" logic instead of custom remote discovery

 "git-parse-remote" shell script library outlived its usefulness.


* ds/config-literal-value (2020-11-25) 8 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-12-02 at 5de40589fc)
 + config doc: value-pattern is not necessarily a regexp
 + config: implement --fixed-value with --get*
 + config: plumb --fixed-value into config API
 + config: add --fixed-value option, un-implemented
 + t1300: add test for --replace-all with value-pattern
 + t1300: test "set all" mode with value-pattern
 + config: replace 'value_regex' with 'value_pattern'
 + config: convert multi_replace to flags
 (this branch is used by ds/maintenance-part-3.)

 Various subcommands of "git config" that takes value_regex
 learn the "--literal-value" option to take the value_regex option
 as a literal string.


* ds/maintenance-part-1 (2020-12-02) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-12-02 at b06515515d)
 + Makefile: mark git-maintenance as a builtin

 Build consistency fix.

  (merged to 'next' on 2020-12-02 at 6739aa076c)
 + t7900: speed up expensive test

 Test fix.


* ds/maintenance-part-3 (2020-11-25) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-12-02 at ee65a83d28)
 + maintenance: use 'git config --fixed-value'
 + Merge branch 'ds/config-literal-value' into ds/maintenance-part-3
 (this branch uses ds/config-literal-value.)

 "git maintenance" command had trouble working in a directory whose
 pathname contained an ERE metacharacter like '+'.


* fc/random-cleanup (2020-12-02) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-12-02 at 3cfe693eb8)

 + completion: zsh: fix file completion regression

 Hotfix for a recent breakage.


* jk/banned (2020-12-02) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-12-02 at 3be67a4909)
 + banned.h: mark ctime_r() and asctime_r() as banned
 + banned.h: mark non-reentrant gmtime, etc as banned

 Non-reentrant time-related library functions and ctime/asctime with
 awkward calling interfaces are banned from the codebase.


* jk/stop-pack-objects-when-fetch-is-killed (2020-12-01) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-12-02 at 9e8b8e4b81)
 + upload-pack: kill pack-objects helper on signal or exit

 "git fetch" that is killed may leave a pack-objects process behind,
 still computing to find a good compression, wasting cycles.  This
 has been corrected.


* jk/stop-pack-objects-when-push-is-killed (2020-11-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-11-25 at f73fb999cd)
 + send-pack: kill pack-objects helper on signal or exit

 "git push" that is killed may leave a pack-objects process behind,
 still computing to find a good compression, wasting cycles.  This
 has been corrected.


* js/add-i-color-fix (2020-11-16) 11 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-11-30 at 5cb8202cd4)
 + add -i: verify in the tests that colors can be overridden
 + add -p: prefer color.diff.context over color.diff.plain
 + add -i (Perl version): color header to match the C version
 + add -i (built-in): use the same indentation as the Perl version
 + add -p (built-in): do not color the progress indicator separately
 + add -i (built-in): use correct names to load color.diff.* config
 + add -i (built-in): prevent the `reset` "color" from being configured
 + add -i: use `reset_color` consistently
 + add -p (built-in): imitate `xdl_format_hunk_hdr()` generating hunk headers
 + add -i (built-in): send error messages to stderr
 + add -i (built-in): do show an error message for incorrect inputs

 "git add -i" failed to honor custom colors configured to show
 patches, which has been corrected.

 + upload-pack: advertise session ID in v0 capabilities
 + trace2: add a public function for getting the SID
 + docs: new transfer.advertiseSID option
 + docs: new capability to advertise session IDs

 The transport layer was taught to optionally exchange the session
 ID assigned by the trace2 subsystem during fetch/push transactions.


* jt/trace-error-on-warning (2020-11-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-11-30 at 1ab8a970f8)
 + usage: add trace2 entry upon warning()

 Like die() and error(), a call to warning() will also trigger a
 trace2 event.


* ma/grep-init-default (2020-11-30) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-12-02 at 6240fa114e)
 + MyFirstObjectWalk: drop `init_walken_defaults()`
 + grep: copy struct in one fell swoop
 + grep: use designated initializers for `grep_defaults`
 + grep: don't set up a "default" repo for grep

 Code clean-up.


* mt/do-not-use-scld-in-working-tree (2020-12-02) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-12-02 at c1c0a6c31e)
 + apply: don't use core.sharedRepository to create working tree files

 "git apply" adjusted the permission bits of working-tree files and
 directories according core.sharedRepository setting by mistake and
 for a long time, which has been corrected.


* nk/perf-fsmonitor-cleanup (2020-11-30) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-12-02 at 3096e954be)
 + perf/fsmonitor: use test_must_be_empty helper

 Test clean-up.


* nm/imap-send-use-default-config (2020-12-01) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-12-02 at 08f4f483b2)
 + imap-send: parse default git config

 "git imap-send" used to ignore configuration variables like
 core.askpass; this has been corrected.


* pb/pull-rebase-recurse-submodules (2020-11-16) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-11-25 at 9837b50d7f)
 + pull: check for local submodule modifications with the right range
 + t5572: describe '--rebase' tests a little more
 + t5572: add notes on a peculiar test
 + pull --rebase: compute rebase arguments in separate function

 "git pull --rebase --recurse-submodules" checked for local changes
 in a wrong range and failed to run correctly when it should.


* pk/subsub-fetch-fix (2020-12-02) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-12-02 at b15a3da5d8)
 + Revert "submodules: fix of regression on fetching of non-init subsub-repo"

 An earlier attempt to fix "git fetch --recurse-submodules" broke
 another use case; revert it until a better fix is found.


* ps/update-ref-multi-transaction (2020-11-16) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-11-30 at c1c3e23374)
 + update-ref: disallow "start" for ongoing transactions
 + p1400: use `git-update-ref --stdin` to test multiple transactions
 + update-ref: allow creation of multiple transactions
 + t1400: avoid touching refs on filesystem

 "git update-ref --stdin" learns to take multiple transactions in a
 single session.


* rs/fetch-pack-invalid-lockfile (2020-11-30) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-12-02 at 39356747b4)
 + fetch-pack: disregard invalid pack lockfiles

 "fetch-pack" could pass NULL pointer to unlink(2) when it sees an
 invalid filename; the error checking has been tightened to make
 this impossible.


* rs/maintenance-run-outside-repo (2020-11-30) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-12-02 at ccfbe5991d)
 + maintenance: fix SEGFAULT when no repository

 "git maintenance run/start/stop" needed to be run in a repository
 to hold the lockfile they use, but didn't make sure they are
 actually in a repository, which has been corrected.


* sn/config-doc-typofix (2020-12-01) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-12-02 at 2d62912243)
 + config.txt: fix a typo (backslash != backquote)

 Fix for an old typo.


* tb/bugreport-no-localtime (2020-12-01) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-12-02 at ca245d2b01)
 + builtin/bugreport.c: use thread-safe localtime_r()

 Use of non-reentrant localtime() has been removed.


* tb/idx-midx-race-fix (2020-11-25) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-11-30 at 493ded178e)
 + midx.c: protect against disappearing packs
 + packfile.c: protect against disappearing indexes

 Processes that access packdata while the .idx file gets removed
 (e.g. while repacking) did not fail or fall back gracefully as they
 could.


* tb/repack-simplify (2020-11-17) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-11-25 at 79a98f2403)
 + builtin/repack.c: don't move existing packs out of the way
 + builtin/repack.c: keep track of what pack-objects wrote
 + repack: make "exts" array available outside cmd_repack()

 Simplify the logic to deal with a repack operation that ended up
 creating the same packfile.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* ab/mktag (2020-12-01) 10 commits
 - mktag doc: update to explain why to use this
 - mktag: use fsck instead of custom verify_tag()
 - fsck: add new "extra" checks for "mktag"
 - mktag tests: improve verify_object() test coverage

 - mktag: reword write_object_file() error
 - mktag: use default strbuf_read() hint
 - mktag doc: say <hash> not <sha1>

 "git mktag" validates its input using its own rules before writing
 a tag object---it has been updated to share the logic with "git
 fsck".

 Expecting a reroll.


* so/glossary-branch-is-not-necessarily-active (2020-12-02) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-12-08 at 01805f8ab6)
 + glossary: improve "branch" definition

 The glossary described a branch as an "active" line of development,
 which is misleading---a stale and non-moving branch is still a
 branch.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ae/doc-reproducible-html (2020-12-02) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-12-08 at 263232f371)

 - future: pull: enable ff-only mode by default

 - pull: trivial memory fix
 - test: pull-options: revert unnecessary changes

 - pull: move default warning
 - pull: trivial cleanup
 - pull: cleanup autostash check
 - pull: refactor fast-forward check
 - pull: improve default warning
 - doc: pull: explain what is a fast-forward

 When a user does not tell "git pull" to use rebase or merge, the
 command gives a loud message telling a user to choose between
 rebase or merge but creates a merge anyway, forcing users who would
 want to rebase to redo the operation.  Fix this by (1) tightening
 the condition to give the message---there is no reason to stop or
 force the user to choose between rebase or merge if the history
 fast-forwards, and (2) failing the operation when the history does
 not fast-forward, instead of making a merge, in such a case.

 - rm: honor sparse checkout patterns
 (this branch uses mt/grep-sparse-checkout.)

 "git rm" follows suit to "git grep" to ignore paths outside the
 sparsity pattern when the sparse checkout feature is in use.

 Need to wait for how these fit in larger picture.

* jk/symlinked-dotgitx-files (2020-10-23) 9 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-10-26 at c1dd37b024)
 + docs: document symlink restrictions for .git* files
 + fsck: complain when .gitattributes or .gitignore is a symlink
 + verify_path(): disallow symlinks in .gitattributes and .gitignore
 + t0060: test obscured .gitattributes and .gitignore matching

 + t7415: rename to expand scope
 + fsck_tree(): wrap some long lines
 + fsck_tree(): fix shadowed variable

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2020-10-23

 "git fsck" and the corresponding check done during the transport
 learned to ensure that in-tree files like `.gitignore` and
 `.gitattributes` are not symbolic links.

 It seems that there are real projects with .gitignore recorded as
 symlinks, which may need to loosen the fsck setting.  Do we need to
 introduce a class that is separate from symlinked .gitmodules that
 probably is with potential consequences that is more/less grave?

 - remote.c: fix handling of %(push:remoteref)

 The "%(push:remoteref)" placeholder in the "--format=" argument of
 "git format-patch" (and friends) only showed what got explicitly
 configured, not what ref at the receiving end would be updated when
 "git push" was used, as it ignored the default behaviour (e.g. update
 the same ref as the source).

 Discard for now.

* dd/help-autocorrect-never (2020-11-25) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-12-08 at f1531ab641)
 + help.c: help.autocorrect=never means "do not compute suggestions"

 "git $cmd $args", when $cmd is not a recognised subcommand, by
 default tries to see if $cmd is a typo of an existing subcommand
 and optionally executes the corrected command if there is only one
 possibility, depending on the setting of help.autocorrect; the
 users can now disable the whole thing, including the cycles spent
 to find a likely typo, by setting the configuration variable to
 'never'.

 Will merge to 'master'.

* sj/untracked-files-in-submodule-directory-is-not-dirty (2020-12-08) 1 commit
 - diff: do not show submodule with untracked files as "-dirty"

 "git diff" showed a submodule working tree with untracked cruft as
 "Submodule commit <objectname>-dirty", but a natural expectation is
 that the "-dirty" indicator would align with "git describe --dirty",
 which does not consider having untracked files in the working tree
 as source of dirtiness.  The inconsistency has been fixed.
