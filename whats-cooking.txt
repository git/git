Subject: What's cooking in git.git (Jun 2014, #02; Fri, 6)
X-master-at: 0953113bb5687f42bcdfc3d20dd3a125784ad383

What's cooking in git.git (Jun 2014, #02; Fri, 6)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.

The second batch of topics, all of which have been cooking for quite
a while on the 'next' branch, have been merged to 'master'.

I am aware of a handful of multi-patch topics sent to the list the
past week that have not been picked up, and I won't be picking them
up yet, before we have a chance to first have some topics that have
been cooking in 'next' during the previous cycle merged to 'master'
and then rewind the tip of 'next'.  At that point, I may have to ask
for them to be rebased on top of the updated 'master' to reduce
conflicts.  Thanks for your patience.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

[Graduated to "master"]

* bc/blame-crlf-test (2014-05-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-05-14 at b819505)
 + blame: correctly handle files regardless of autocrlf

 If a file contained CRLF line endings in a repository with
 core.autocrlf=input, then blame always marked lines as "Not
 Committed Yet", even if they were unmodified.


* da/imap-send-use-credential-helper (2014-04-29) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-05-12 at b0698a5)
 + imap-send: use git-credential

 "git imap-send" learned to ask the credential helper for
 authentication material.


* dk/blame-reorg (2014-04-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-05-14 at 354a0e3)
 + blame: large-scale performance rewrite

 "git blame" has been optimized greatly by reorganising the data
 structure that is used to keep track of the work to be done, thanks
 to David Karstrup <dak@gnu.org>.


* dk/raise-core-deltabasecachelimit (2014-05-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-05-12 at 97ec92a)
 + Bump core.deltaBaseCacheLimit to 96m

 The `core.deltabasecachelimit` used to default to 16 MiB, but this
 proved to be too small, and has been bumped to 96 MiB.


* dt/merge-recursive-case-insensitive (2014-05-08) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-05-12 at 820d524)
 + mv: allow renaming to fix case on case insensitive filesystems
 + merge-recursive.c: fix case-changing merge bug

 On a case insensitive filesystem, merge-recursive incorrectly
 deleted the file that is to be renamed to a name that is the same
 except for case differences.


* ep/shell-assign-and-export-vars (2014-05-23) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-05-23 at 7699c0e)
 + scripts: more "export VAR=VALUE" fixes
 + scripts: "export VAR=VALUE" construct is not portable


* fc/status-printf-squelch-format-zero-length-warnings (2014-05-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-05-12 at 6b04e23)
 + silence a bunch of format-zero-length warnings


* jc/coding-guidelines (2014-05-20) 9 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-05-23 at bb351fc)
 + CodingGuidelines: avoid "test <cond> -a/-o <cond>"
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-05-12 at e1fcf62)
 + CodingGuidelines: on splitting a long line
 + CodingGuidelines: on comparison
 + CodingGuidelines: do not call the conditional statement "if()"
 + CodingGuidelines: give an example for shell function preamble
 + CodingGuidelines: give an example for control statements
 + CodingGuidelines: give an example for redirection
 + CodingGuidelines: give an example for case/esac statement
 + CodingGuidelines: once it is in, it is not worth the code churn

 Some people need these things spelled out, unable to follow advices
 given by others when they fail to imitate the surrounding existing
 code.


* jd/subtree (2014-05-13) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-05-14 at 977db74)
 + contrib/subtree: allow adding an annotated tag

 Clean-up build procedure of subtree in contrib/.


* je/pager-do-not-recurse (2014-04-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-05-12 at 32de470)
 + pager: do allow spawning pager recursively

 We used to unconditionally disable the pager in the pager process
 we spawn to feed out output, but that prevented people who want to
 run "less" within "less" from doing so.


* jj/command-line-adjective (2014-05-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-05-23 at fe136c8)
 + Documentation: use "command-line" when used as a compound adjective, and fix other minor grammatical issues


* jk/commit-C-pick-empty (2014-04-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-05-12 at c187e1e)
 + commit: do not complain of empty messages from -C

 "git commit --allow-empty-message -C $commit" did not work when the
 commit did not have any log message.


* jk/grep-tell-run-command-to-cd-when-running-pager (2014-05-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-05-12 at 065cb22)
 + grep: use run-command's "dir" option for --open-files-in-pager


* jk/index-pack-report-missing (2014-05-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-05-14 at 72d40e1)
 + index-pack: distinguish missing objects from type errors


* jk/squelch-compiler-warning-from-funny-error-macro (2014-05-06) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-05-12 at d9daf8d)
 + let clang use the constant-return error() macro
 + inline constant return from error() function


* jk/utf8-switch-between-nfd-and-nfc (2014-04-29) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-05-12 at 948823c)
 + t3910: show failure of core.precomposeunicode with decomposed filenames

 Document a known breakage with a test.


* jn/contrib-remove-diffall (2014-05-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-05-12 at 416009e)

 Spring cleaning of contrib/.


* jn/contrib-remove-vim (2014-05-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-05-12 at 9e727c8)
 + contrib: remove vim support instructions

 Spring cleaning of contrib/.


* jn/test-lint-unmoor (2014-05-23) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-05-23 at aa997bc)
 + test-lint: find unportable sed, echo, test, and export usage after &&


* mc/git-p4-prepare-p4-only (2014-05-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-05-27 at 71572fe)
 + git-p4: Do not include diff in spec file when just preparing p4


* mk/show-s-no-extra-blank-line-for-merges (2014-05-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-05-21 at 3b98b35)
 + git-show: fix 'git show -s' to not add extra terminator after merge commit

 "git show -s" (i.e. show log message only) used to incorrectly emit
 an extra blank line after a merge commit.


* mm/pager-less-sans-S (2014-05-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-05-07 at 66ce999)
 + pager: remove 'S' from $LESS by default

 Since the very beginning of Git, we gave the LESS environment a
 default value "FRSX" when we spawn "less" as the pager.  "S" (chop
 long lines instead of wrapping) has been removed from this default
 set of options, because it is more or less a personal taste thing,
 as opposed to others that have good justifications (i.e. "R" is
 very much justified because many kinds of output we produce are
 colored and "FX" is justified because output we produce is often
 shorter than a page).


* mt/rebase-i-keep-empty-test (2014-05-19) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-05-21 at d87d266)
 + rebase --keep-empty -i: add test


* nd/status-auto-comment-char (2014-05-19) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-05-21 at f762e62)
 + commit: allow core.commentChar=auto for character auto selection
 + config: be strict on core.commentChar

 The `core.commentChar` configuration variable is used to specify a
 custom comment character other than the default "#" to be used in
 the commit log editor.  This can be set to `auto` to attempt to
 choose a different character that does not conflict with what
 already starts a line in the message being edited for cases like
 "git commit --amend".


* rs/reflog-exists (2014-05-08) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-05-12 at 24a1d01)
 + checkout.c: use ref_exists instead of file_exist
 + refs.c: add new functions reflog_exists and delete_reflog


* sk/spawn-less-case-insensitively-from-grep-O-i (2014-05-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-05-21 at eb28305)
 + git grep -O -i: if the pager is 'less', pass the '-I' option

 "git grep -O" to show the lines that hit in the pager did not work
 well with case insensitive search.  We now spawn "less" with its
 "-I" option when it is used as the pager (which is the default).


* sk/submodules-absolute-path-on-windows (2014-05-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-05-14 at 83a05d9)
 + Revert "submodules: fix ambiguous absolute paths under Windows"


* ss/howto-manage-trunk (2014-05-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-05-28 at 5318336)
 + How to keep a project's canonical history correct.


* tb/unicode-6.3-zero-width (2014-05-12) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-05-14 at 08e0171)
 + utf8: make it easier to auto-update git_wcwidth()
 + utf8.c: use a table for double_width

 Update the logic to compute the display width needed for utf8
 strings and allow us to more easily maintain the tables used in
 that logic.

 We may want to let the users choose if codepoints with ambiguous
 widths are treated as a double or single width in a follow-up patch.


* tg/tag-state-tag-name-in-editor-hints (2014-05-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-05-12 at 0b7db32)
 + builtin/tag.c: show tag name to hint in the message editor

 "git tag" when editing the tag message shows the name of the tag
 being edited as a comment in the editor.


* tl/relax-in-poll-emulation (2014-04-29) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-05-12 at 9369b08)
 + compat/poll: sleep 1 millisecond to avoid busy wait


* wg/svn-fe-style-fixes (2014-05-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-05-12 at 88c0e0d)
 + svn-fe: conform to pep8


* wk/doc-clarify-upstream (2014-05-13) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-05-14 at 6c8fb52)
 + Documentation: mention config sources for @{upstream}

 "update-index --cacheinfo" in 2.0 crashes on a malformed command line.

 Will merge to 'master'.

* bg/rebase-off-of-previous-branch (2014-04-16) 1 commit
 - git-rebase: print name of rev when using shorthand

 Teach "git rebase -" to report the concrete name of the branch
 (i.e. the previous one).

 But it stops short and does not do the same for "git rebase @{-1}".
 Expecting a reroll.


* tr/merge-recursive-index-only (2014-02-05) 3 commits
 - merge-recursive: -Xindex-only to leave worktree unchanged
 - merge-recursive: internal flag to avoid touching the worktree
 - merge-recursive: remove dead conditional in update_stages()
 (this branch is used by tr/remerge-diff.)

 Will hold.


* tr/remerge-diff (2014-02-26) 5 commits
 . log --remerge-diff: show what the conflict resolution changed
 . name-hash: allow dir hashing even when !ignore_case
 . merge-recursive: allow storing conflict hunks in index
 . revision: fold all merge diff variants into an enum merge_diff_mode
 . combine-diff: do not pass revs->dense_combined_merges redundantly
 (this branch uses tr/merge-recursive-index-only.)

 "log -p" output learns a new way to let users inspect a merge
 commit by showing the differences between the automerged result
 with conflicts the person who recorded the merge would have seen
 and the final conflict resolution that was recorded in the merge.

 Needs to be rebased, now kb/fast-hashmap topic is in.


* jk/makefile (2014-02-05) 16 commits
 . FIXUP
 . move LESS/LV pager environment to Makefile
 . Makefile: teach scripts to include make variables
 . FIXUP

 . Makefile: use tempfile/mv strategy for GIT-*
 . Makefile: introduce make-var helper function
 . Makefile: fix git-instaweb dependency on gitweb
 . Makefile: drop USE_GETTEXT_SCHEME from GIT-CFLAGS

 Simplify the Makefile rules and macros that exist primarily for
 quoting purposes, and make it easier to robustly express the
 dependency rules.

 Expecting a reroll.


* po/everyday-doc (2014-01-27) 1 commit
 - Make 'git help everyday' work

 This may make the said command to emit something, but the source is
 not meant to be formatted into a manual pages to begin with, and
 also its contents are a bit stale.  It may be a good first step in
 the right direction, but needs more work to at least get the
 mark-up right before public consumption.

 Will hold.


* jk/branch-at-publish-rebased (2014-01-17) 5 commits
 . t1507 (rev-parse-upstream): fix typo in test title
 . implement @{publish} shorthand
 . branch_get: provide per-branch pushremote pointers
 . branch_get: return early on error
 . sha1_name: refactor upstream_mark

 Give an easier access to the tracking branches from "other" side in
 a triangular workflow by introducing B@{publish} that works in a
 similar way to how B@{upstream} does.

 Meant to be used as a basis for whatever Ram wants to build on.

 Ejected from 'pu' to unclutter.


* fc/publish-vs-upstream (2014-04-21) 8 commits
 . sha1_name: add support for @{publish} marks
 . sha1_name: simplify track finding
 . sha1_name: cleanup interpret_branch_name()
 . branch: display publish branch
 . push: add --set-publish option
 . branch: add --set-publish-to option
 . Add concept of 'publish' branch
 . t5516 (fetch-push): fix test restoration

 Add branch@{publish}; it seems that this is somewhat different from
 Ram and Peff started working on.  At least the tip needs to be
 rerolled not to squat on @{p} which @{push} and possibly @{pull}
 may want to share.

 Ejected from 'pu' to unclutter.


* rb/merge-prepare-commit-msg-hook (2014-01-10) 4 commits
 - merge: drop unused arg from abort_commit method signature
 - merge: make prepare_to_commit responsible for write_merge_state
 - t7505: ensure cleanup after hook blocks merge
 - t7505: add missing &&

 Expose more merge states (e.g. $GIT_DIR/MERGE_MODE) to hooks that
 run during "git merge".  The log message stresses too much on one
 hook, prepare-commit-msg, but it would equally apply to other hooks
 like post-merge, I think.

 Waiting for a reroll.

 - submodule: teach unpack_trees() to update submodules
 - submodule: teach unpack_trees() to repopulate submodules

 . unpack-objects: allow to save processed bytes to a buffer
 - ...

 Nico and Duy advancing the eternal vaporware pack-v4.  This is here
 primarily for wider distribution of the preview edition.

 Needs to be rebased, now the pack-bitmap series is in.


* tg/perf-lib-test-perf-cleanup (2013-09-19) 2 commits
 - perf-lib: add test_perf_cleanup target
 - perf-lib: split starting the test from the execution

 Add test_perf_cleanup shell function to the perf suite, that allows
 the script writers to define a test with a clean-up action.

 Will hold.


* jc/show-branch (2014-03-24) 5 commits
 - show-branch: use commit slab to represent bitflags of arbitrary width
 - show-branch.c: remove "all_mask"
 - show-branch.c: abstract out "flags" operation
 - show-branch.c: lift all_mask/all_revs to a global static
 - show-branch.c: update comment style

* jl/status-added-submodule-is-never-ignored (2014-04-07) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-06-06 at a2d0105)
 + commit -m: commit staged submodules regardless of ignore config
 + status/commit: show staged submodules regardless of ignore config

 submodule.*.ignore and diff.ignoresubmodules are used to ignore all
 submodule changes in "diff" output, but it can be confusing to
 apply these configuration values to status and commit.

 This is a backward-incompatible change, but should be so in a good
 way (aka bugfix).

 Will merge to 'master'.

 + remote: repack packed-refs once when deleting multiple refs
 + remote rm: delete remote configuration as the last

 "git remote rm" and "git remote prune" can involve removing many
 refs at once, which is not a very efficient thing to do when very
 many refs exist in the packed-refs file.

  (merged to 'next' on 2014-06-06 at 638c6ca)
 + gc --auto: do not lock refs in the background

 "git gc --auto" was recently changed to run in the background to
 give control back early to the end-user sitting in front of the
 terminal, but it forgot that housekeeping involving reflogs should
 be done without other processes competing for accesses to the refs.
