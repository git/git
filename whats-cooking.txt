What's cooking in git.git (May 2010, #01; Sun, 2)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones
marked with '.' do not appear in any of the integration branches, but I am
still holding onto them.

The latest release 1.7.1 has been out for a week and I will soon rewind
'next' and switch 'maint' for 1.7.1.X series.  It appears that no grave
regression has been reported, which is a good sign.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* cb/maint-stash-orphaned-file (2010-04-18) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-22 at f9de16c)
 + stash tests: stash can lose data in a file removed from the index
 + stash: Don't overwrite files that have gone from the index

* jn/maint-bundle (2010-04-19) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-22 at b2668a6)
 + fix "bundle --stdin" segfault
 + t5704 (bundle): add tests for bundle --stdin

* pb/patch-id-plus (2010-04-19) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-22 at 5177f8b)

 - remote add: add a --[no-]tags option
 - Honor "tagopt = --tags" configuration option

* jc/rev-list-ancestry-path (2010-04-20) 1 commit
 - revision: --ancestry-path

Just an illustration patch.  merge simplification logic used when
pathspecs are in effect interacts with this rather badly.

* cb/assume-unchanged-fix (2010-05-01) 2 commits
 - Documentation: git-add does not update files marked "assume unchanged"
 - do not overwrite files marked "assume unchanged"

* jn/fsck-ident (2010-04-24) 1 commit
 - fsck: check ident lines in commit objects

* jn/gitweb-caching-prep (2010-04-24) 5 commits
 - gitweb: Move generating page title to separate subroutine
 - gitweb: Add custom error handler using die_error
 - gitweb: Use nonlocal jump instead of 'exit' in die_error

 (this branch is used by jn/request-pull.)

* jn/request-pull (2010-04-24) 2 commits
 - adapt request-pull tests for new pull request format

 . pretty: Respect --abbrev option
 . shortlog: Document and test --format option
 . t4201 (shortlog): Test output format with multiple authors
 . t4201 (shortlog): guard setup with test_expect_success

This seems to cause intermittent test failure for me especially when run
under "make -j4".

 - pretty: add aliases for pretty formats
 - pretty: add infrastructure to allow format aliases
 - pretty: make it easier to add new formats

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

These were pushed out as part of 1.7.1

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* js/rebase-origin-x (2010-02-05) 1 commit
 - [RFC w/o test and incomplete] rebase: add -x option to record original commit name

I retract my objection against the idea of -x; needs polishing before
moving forward.

* js/grep-open (2010-05-01) 3 commits
 - grep: do not ignore return value from chdir()
 - grep -O: allow optional argument specifying the pager (or editor)
 - grep: Add the option '--open-files-in-pager'
 (this branch is used by jp/hold-string-list-sanity.)

Probably needs to support --no-index mode as well.

* jp/hold-string-list-sanity (2010-04-06) 9 commits
 . string_list: Fix argument order for string_list_append
 . Merge branch 'sr/remote-helper-export' into HEAD
 . Merge branch 'js/grep-open' into HEAD
 . Merge branch 'sb/fmt-merge-msg' into HEAD
 . string_list: Fix argument order for string_list_lookup
 . string_list: Fix argument order for string_list_insert_at_index
 . string_list: Fix argument order for string_list_insert
 . string_list: Fix argument order for for_each_string_list
 . string_list: Fix argument order for print_string_list
 (this branch uses js/grep-open and sr/remote-helper-export.)

Building this on top of slushy codebase is not a very promising endeavor.
Good thing to do, but it came at a bad time.

--------------------------------------------------

  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-22 at bf9c927)
 + reflog --expire-unreachable: special case entries in "HEAD" reflog
 + more war on "sleep" in tests
 + Document gc.<pattern>.reflogexpire variables
 (this branch uses jc/maint-reflog-expire-unreachable.)

Rerolled; instead of ignoring the configuration like the previous round
did, this one prunes stale entries that are unreachable from any ref from
the reflog of HEAD.

* cw/maint-exec-defpath (2010-04-15) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-22 at e990e5b)

  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-22 at a10062e)

There are gitk patches that go with this series.

  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-22 at f712ae9)

 + send-email: Cleanup { style

* rc/ls-remote-default (2010-04-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-14 at d5081bd)

* rc/maint-curl-helper (2010-04-08) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-14 at 2eb9177)

* jc/status-show-ignored (2010-05-01) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-05-01 at 6845abd)
 + wt-status: fix 'fprintf' compilation warning
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-22 at c6abe03)
 + status: --ignored option shows ignored files
 + wt-status: rename and restructure status-print-untracked
 + wt-status: collect ignored files
 + wt-status: plug memory leak while collecting untracked files
 + wt-status: remove unused workdir_untracked member

I am negative about conflating the JSON output to the mix at this point.
Let's stabilize "status" with the existing --porcelain/-z option first.

* eb/unpretty-b-format (2010-03-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-07 at 7f5c112)
 + Add `%B' in format strings for raw commit body in `git log' and friends

* ab/commit-empty-message (2010-04-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-07 at 701e863)
 + Add option to git-commit to allow empty log messages

* jc/test-sleepless (2010-04-06) 1 commit

  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-22 at 2a46172)

 (this branch is used by jc/maint-no-reflog-expire-unreach-for-head.)

* np/malloc-threading (2010-04-08) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-10 at e1730fb)
 + Thread-safe xmalloc and xrealloc needs a recursive mutex
 + Make xmalloc and xrealloc thread-safe

The fix should eventually go to 'maint' and 'master'.  This queues the one
from J6t for Windows compatibility.

* js/async-thread (2010-03-09) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-22 at ee8874e)
 + Enable threaded async procedures whenever pthreads is available
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-03-20 at 9939243)
 + Dying in an async procedure should only exit the thread, not the process.
 + Reimplement async procedures using pthreads
 + Windows: more pthreads functions
 + Fix signature of fcntl() compatibility dummy
 + Make report() from usage.c public as vreportf() and use it.
 + Modernize t5530-upload-pack-error.

As the malloc-threading topic has been cooking for a while, the tip one
may not be so bad to unleash to 'next' users, especially because we are in
the pre-release feature freeze.

* sd/log-decorate (2010-04-08) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-08 at 68fee56)
 + log.decorate: only ignore it under "log --pretty=raw"
 + script with rev-list instead of log
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-06 at 992c9ad)
 + log --pretty/--oneline: ignore log.decorate
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-03-08 at 58a6fba)
 + log.decorate: usability fixes
 + Add `log.decorate' configuration variable.
 + git_config_maybe_bool()

* mh/status-optionally-refresh (2010-04-03) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-05 at 0e64aac)
 + t7508: add a test for "git status" in a read-only repository
 + git status: refresh the index if possible
 + t7508: add test for "git status" refreshing the index

* cw/ws-indent-with-tab (2010-04-03) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-05 at 5b5e579)
 + whitespace: tests for git-apply --whitespace=fix with tab-in-indent
 + whitespace: add tab-in-indent support for --whitespace=fix
 + whitespace: replumb ws_fix_copy to take a strbuf *dst instead of char *dst
 + whitespace: tests for git-diff --check with tab-in-indent error class
 + whitespace: add tab-in-indent error class
 + whitespace: we cannot "catch all errors known to git" anymore

* sr/remote-helper-export (2010-04-12) 9 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-12 at cefbb2f)
 + t5800: testgit helper requires Python support
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-09 at 94f6e3d)
 + Makefile: Simplify handling of python scripts
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-07 at 5651307)
 + remote-helpers: add tests for testgit helper
 + remote-helpers: add testgit helper
 + remote-helpers: add support for an export command
 + remote-helpers: allow requesing the path to the .git directory
 + fast-import: always create marks_file directories
 + clone: also configure url for bare clones
 + clone: pass the remote name to remote_get
 (this branch is used by jp/hold-string-list-sanity.)

* cc/revert-strategy (2010-03-31) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-05 at 50909c1)
 + revert: add "--strategy" option to choose merge strategy
 + merge: make function try_merge_command non static
 + merge: refactor code that calls "git merge-STRATEGY"
 + revert: refactor merge recursive code into its own function
 + revert: use strbuf to refactor the code that writes the merge message

This is more about debugging and we are not in a great hurry.

* sc/http-late-auth (2010-04-01) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-02 at c991acf)
 + Prompt for a username when an HTTP request 401s

* jk/cached-textconv (2010-04-01) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-02 at a023e3c)
 + diff: avoid useless filespec population
 + diff: cache textconv output
 + textconv: refactor calls to run_textconv
 + introduce notes-cache interface
 + make commit_tree a library function

The small leak fixes in the beginning of the series has been merged to
'master' after a minor fixup.

* ld/discovery-limit-to-fs (2010-04-04) 6 commits
 - write-index: check and warn when worktree crosses a filesystem boundary
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-07 at 11ea09a)
 + Rename ONE_FILESYSTEM to DISCOVERY_ACROSS_FILESYSTEM
 + GIT_ONE_FILESYSTEM: flip the default to stop at filesystem boundaries
 + Add support for GIT_ONE_FILESYSTEM
 + truncate cwd string before printing error message
 + config.c: remove static keyword from git_env_bool()

The tip one is a bit iffy; the whole series changes behaviour in a corner
case, and is not a 1.7.1 material.

* pc/remove-warn (2010-03-26) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-02 at 52fc00d)
 + Remove a redundant errno test in a usage of remove_path
 + Introduce remove_or_warn function
 + Implement the rmdir_or_warn function
 + Generalise the unlink_or_warn function

I cherry-picked only obviously sensible bits.

* em/checkout-orphan (2010-03-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-03-28 at 86b6a4f)
 + git checkout: create unparented branch by --orphan

Perhaps needs a bit of documentation updates, describing the "going open
source" scenario.

* ar/config-from-command-line (2010-03-26) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-07 at e50fd3a)
 + Use strbufs instead of open-coded string manipulation
