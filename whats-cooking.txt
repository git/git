What's cooking in git.git (Mar 2019, #01; Wed, 6)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

The maintenance track will be updated to preprare for 2.21.1 soonish,
to address breakages with certain versions of msgfmt in 2.21.0; the
tip of 'next' will also be updated at around the same time.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* jk/bisect-final-output (2019-03-01) 3 commits
 - bisect: make diff-tree output prettier
 - bisect: fix internal diff-tree config loading
 - bisect: use string arguments to feed internal diff-tree

 The final report from "git bisect" used to show the suspected
 culprit using a raw "diff-tree", with which there is no output for
 a merge commit.  This has been updated to use a more modern and
 human readable output that still is concise enough.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/fsck-doc (2019-03-05) 2 commits
 - fsck: always compute USED flags for unreachable objects
 - doc/fsck: clarify --connectivity-only behavior

 "git fsck --connectivity-only" omits computation necessary to sift
 the objects that are not reachable from any of the refs into
 unreachable and dangling.  This is now documented, and also the
 computation is done in order to show the dangling objects when
 requested (which is done by default, but can be overridden with
 the "--no-dangling" option).

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/no-sigpipe-during-network-transport (2019-03-05) 2 commits
 - fetch: ignore SIGPIPE during network operation
 - fetch: avoid calling write_or_die()

 On platforms where "git fetch" is killed with SIGPIPE (e.g. OSX),
 the upload-pack that runs on the other end that hangs up after
 detecting an error could cause "git fetch" to die with a signal,
 which led to a flakey test.  "git fetch" now ignores SIGPIPE during
 the network portion of its operation (this is not a problem as we
 check the return status from our write(2)s).

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/virtual-objects-do-exist (2019-03-05) 1 commit
 - rev-list: allow cached objects in existence check

 A recent update broke "is this object available to us?" check for
 well-known objects like an empty tree (which should yield "yes",
 even when there is no on-disk object for an empty tree), which has
 been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* js/anonymize-remote-curl-diag (2019-03-06) 2 commits
 - remote-curl: mark all error messages for translation
 - curl: anonymize URLs in error messages and warnings

 remote-http transport did not anonymize URLs reported in its error
 messages at places.

 Will merge to 'next' the bottom one.
 The i18n of die() messages conflicts with topics in flight, so will
 be dealt with separately when the tree is more quiescent.


* js/find-lib-h-with-ls-files-when-possible (2019-03-05) 1 commit
 - Makefile: use `git ls-files` to list header files, if possible

 The Makefile uses 'find' utility to enumerate all the *.h header
 files, which is expensive on platforms with slow filesystems; it
 now optionally uses "ls-files" if working within a repository,
 which is a trick similar to how all sources are enumerated to run
 ETAGS on.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* js/rebase-orig-head-fix (2019-03-04) 4 commits
 - built-in rebase: set ORIG_HEAD just once, before the rebase
 - built-in rebase: demonstrate that ORIG_HEAD is not set correctly
 - built-in rebase: use the correct reflog when switching branches
 - built-in rebase: no need to check out `onto` twice

 "gir rebase" that was reimplemented in C did not set ORIG_HEAD
 correctly, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* js/rebase-recreate-merge (2019-03-01) 1 commit
 - rebase docs: fix "gitlink" typo

 Docfix.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 - test functions: add function `test_file_not_empty`

 A GSoC micro.

 Need to pick up a newer version.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* ds/midx-expire-repack (2019-01-27) 10 commits
 - midx: add test that 'expire' respects .keep files
 - multi-pack-index: test expire while adding packs
 - midx: implement midx_repack()
 - multi-pack-index: prepare 'repack' subcommand

 coalesce small pack files that are still in use.

 Comments?


* jt/test-protocol-version (2019-02-06) 8 commits
 - t5552: compensate for v2 filtering ref adv.
 - tests: fix protocol version for overspecifications
 - t5700: only run with protocol version 1
 - t5512: compensate for v0 only sending HEAD symrefs
 - t5503: fix overspecification of trace expectation
 - tests: always test fetch of unreachable with v0
 - tests: define GIT_TEST_PROTOCOL_VERSION
 - Merge branch 'js/protocol-advertise-multi' into jt/test-protocol-version
 (this branch uses js/protocol-advertise-multi.)

 Help developers by making it easier to run most of the tests under
 different versions of over-the-wire protocols.

 Blocked by js/protocol-advertise-multi


* js/protocol-advertise-multi (2018-12-28) 1 commit
 - protocol: advertise multiple supported versions
 (this branch is used by jt/test-protocol-version.)

 The transport layer has been updated so that the protocol version
 used can be negotiated between the parties, by the initiator
 listing the protocol versions it is willing to talk, and the other
 side choosing from one of them.

 Expecting a reroll.

* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2018-10-15) 1 commit
 - zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".


* dl/remote-save-to-push (2018-12-11) 1 commit
 - remote: add --save-to-push option to git remote set-url

 "git remote set-url" learned a new option that moves existing value
 of the URL field to pushURL field of the remote before replacing
 the URL field with a new value.

 Anybody who wants to champion this topic?
 I am personally not yet quite convinced if this is worth pursuing.


* nb/branch-show-other-worktrees-head (2019-02-01) 3 commits
 - branch: add an extra verbose output displaying worktree path for refs checked out in a linked worktree
 - branch: mark and color a branch differently if it is checked out in a linked worktree
 - ref-filter: add worktreepath atom

 "git branch --list" learned to show branches that are checked out
 in other worktrees connected to the same repository prefixed with
 '+', similar to the way the currently checked out branch is shown
 with '*' in front.

 The top one probably deserves retitling.
 The second one is of dubious value.

[Cooking]

* bp/post-index-change-hook (2019-02-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-02-23 at 70cc07cebe)
 + read-cache: add post-index-change hook

 A new hook "post-index-change" is called when the on-disk index
 file changes, which can help e.g. a virtualized working tree
 implementation.

 - format-patch: --no-clobber refrains from overwriting output files
 - format-patch: notice failure to open cover letter for writing
 - builtin/log: downcase the beginning of error messages

 "git format-patch" used overwrite an existing patch/cover-letter
 file.  A new "--no-clobber" option stops it.

 Will merge to 'next' after dropping the tip commit.
 I think the bottom two were indenendently good changes; the top one
 was met with "Meh" by reviewer(s), and I tend to agree.


* jk/diff-no-index-initialize (2019-02-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-02-24 at f37a814eb0)
 + diff: reuse diff setup for --no-index case

 "git diff --no-index" may still want to access Git goodies like
 --ext-diff and --textconv, but so far these have been ignored,
 which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 match the pathspec that are in the current index and working tree
 and are not in the tree-ish.

 Will hold.

 The %(trailers) formatter in "git log --format=..."  now allows to
 optionally pick trailers selectively by keyword, show only values,
 etc.

* jn/unknown-index-extensions (2018-11-21) 2 commits
 - index: offer advice for unknown index extensions
 - index: do not warn about unrecognized extensions

 A bit too alarming warning given when unknown index extensions
 exist is getting revamped.

 Expecting a reroll.

 "git branch" learned a new subcommand "--show-current".

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ag/sequencer-reduce-rewriting-todo (2019-01-29) 16 commits
 - rebase--interactive: move transform_todo_file() to rebase--interactive.c
 - sequencer: use edit_todo_list() in complete_action()
 - rebase-interactive: rewrite edit_todo_list() to handle the initial edit
 - rebase-interactive: append_todo_help() changes
 - rebase-interactive: use todo_list_write_to_file() in edit_todo_list()
 - sequencer: refactor skip_unnecessary_picks() to work on a todo_list
 - sequencer: change complete_action() to use the refactored functions
 - sequencer: make sequencer_make_script() write its script to a strbuf
 - sequencer: refactor rearrange_squash() to work on a todo_list
 - sequencer: refactor sequencer_add_exec_commands() to work on a todo_list
 - sequencer: refactor check_todo_list() to work on a todo_list
 - sequencer: introduce todo_list_write_to_file()
 - sequencer: refactor transform_todos() to work on a todo_list
 - sequencer: remove the 'arg' field from todo_item
 - sequencer: make the todo_list structure public
 - sequencer: changes in parse_insn_buffer()

 The scripted version of "git rebase -i" wrote and rewrote the todo
 list many times during a single step of its operation, and the
 recent C-rewrite made a faithful conversion of the logic to C.  The
 implementation has been updated to carry necessary information
 around in-core to avoid rewriting the same file over and over
 unnecessarily.

 Need to pick up a newer version.

* pw/add-p-select (2018-07-26) 4 commits
 - add -p: optimize line selection for short hunks
 - add -p: allow line selection to be inverted
 - add -p: select modified lines correctly
 - add -p: select individual hunk lines

 "git add -p" interactive interface learned to let users choose
 individual added/removed lines to be used in the operation, instead
 of accepting or rejecting a whole hunk.

 Will discard.
 No further feedbacks on the topic for quite some time.

 I found the feature to be hard to explain, and may result in more
 end-user complaints, but let's see.
