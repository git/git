What's cooking in git.git (Aug 2010, #02; Wed, 11)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones
marked with '.' do not appear in any of the integration branches, but I am
still holding onto them.

Has the rate of patch traffic increased markedly for the past few months?
I am feeling perpetually behind these days...

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* ab/omit-aggregate-test-result-under-tap-harness (2010-08-11) 1 commit

I had trouble merging these three topics to 'pu' and ran out of time my
git Wednesday this week.  I think the "no-change-wo-status" one had some
unintended consequences discovered on the list?

branched this off of jn/parse-date-basic (I'll fix it up before merging
this to 'next').

look.
