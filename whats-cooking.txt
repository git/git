What's cooking in git.git (Sep 2019, #03; Sun, 29)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

I've been offline for a week or so, and have been trying to process
the backlog, but I am sure there are still things to be picked up.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

 symbolic link is merged with a branch that replaces it with a
 directory has been fixed.

 Will merge to 'next'.

* en/fast-imexport-nested-tags (2019-09-28) 8 commits
 . fast-export: handle nested tags

* js/diff-rename-force-stable-sort (2019-09-28) 2 commits
 - diffcore_rename(): use a stable sort
 - Move git_sort(), a stable sort, into into libgit.a

 The rename detection logic sorts a list of rename source candidates
 by similarity to pick the best candidate, which means that a tie
 between sources with the same similarity is broken by the original
 location in the original canidate list (which is sorted by path).
 Force the sorting by similarity done with a stable sort, which is
 not promised by system supplied qsort(3), to ensure consistent
 results across platforms.

 Except for a minor nit, this looked OK.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 - builtin/submodule--helper: fix usage string for 'update-clone'

 Typofix.

 Will merge to 'next'.

* es/walken-tutorial (2019-08-07) 1 commit
 - documentation: add tutorial for revision walking

 A tutorial on object enumeration.

 Perhaps take the thing with as little tweaks as possible, retitling
 it to "my first object enumeration" or something?
 cf. <20190814183328.GA40797@google.com>


* dl/format-patch-cover-letter-subject (2019-09-05) 1 commit
 - format-patch: learn --infer-cover-subject option
 (this branch uses dl/format-patch-doc-test-cleanup.)

 "git format-patch --cover-letter" learned to optionally use the
 first paragraph (typically a single-liner) of branch.*.description
 as the subject of the cover letter.

 Reroll with a redesign with less emphasis on "subject" coming?


* mt/threaded-grep-in-object-store (2019-08-13) 4 commits
 - grep: re-enable threads in some non-worktree cases
 - grep: disable grep_read_mutex when possible
 - grep: allow locks to be enabled individually
 - object-store: add lock to read_object_file_extended()

 Traditionally, we avoided threaded grep while searching in objects
 (as opposed to files in the working tree) as accesses to the object
 layer is not thread-safe.  This limitation is getting lifted.

 Expecting a reroll.

* jn/unknown-index-extensions (2018-11-21) 2 commits
 - index: offer advice for unknown index extensions
 - index: do not warn about unrecognized extensions

 A bit too alarming warning given when unknown index extensions
 exist is getting revamped.

 Expecting a reroll.


* jc/format-patch-delay-message-id (2019-04-05) 1 commit
 - format-patch: move message-id and related headers to the end

 The location "git format-patch --thread" adds the Message-Id:
 header in the series of header fields has been moved down, which
 may help working around a suspected bug in GMail MSA, reported at
 <CAHk-=whP1stFZNAaJiMi5eZ9rj0MRt20Y_yHVczZPH+O01d+sA@mail.gmail.com>

 Waiting for feedback to see if it truly helps.
 Needs tests.

 - http: improve documentation of http_pack_request
 - http: use --stdin when getting dumb HTTP pack

 WIP for allowing a response to "git fetch" to instruct the bulk of
 the pack contents to be instead taken from elsewhere (aka CDN).


* js/protocol-advertise-multi (2018-12-28) 1 commit
 - protocol: advertise multiple supported versions

 The transport layer has been updated so that the protocol version
 used can be negotiated between the parties, by the initiator
 listing the protocol versions it is willing to talk, and the other
 side choosing from one of them.

 Expecting a reroll.

* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2018-10-15) 1 commit
 - zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

 - commit-graph: bump DIE_ON_LOAD check to actual load-time

 (this branch uses pw/rebase-i-show-HEAD-to-reword.)

 "git rebase -i" learned a few options that are known by "git
 rebase" proper.

 Is this ready for 'next'?


* ab/pcre-jit-fixes (2019-08-19) 18 commits
 - grep: under --debug, show whether PCRE JIT is enabled

 + rebase: teach rebase --keep-base
 + rebase tests: test linear branch topology
 + rebase: fast-forward --fork-point in more cases

 + rebase: refactor can_fast_forward into goto tower

 + t3432: distinguish "noop-same" v.s. "work-same" in "same head" tests
 + t3432: test rebase fast-forward behavior
 + t3431: add rebase --fork-point tests

 "git rebase --keep-base <upstream>" tries to find the original base
 of the topic being rebased and rebase on top of that same base,
 which is useful when running the "git rebase -i" (and its limited
 variant "git rebase -x").

 The command also has learned to fast-forward in more cases where it
 can instead of replaying to recreate identical commits.

* jc/format-patch-noclobber (2019-02-22) 1 commit

 "git remote set-url" learned a new option that moves existing value
 of the URL field to pushURL field of the remote before replacing
 the URL field with a new value.

 Anybody who wants to champion this topic?
 I am personally not yet quite convinced if this is worth pursuing.

 The JSON output produced by "trace2" subsystem now has JSON schema
 defined on it, to allow us validate the output and catch deviation.

 Abandoned, at least for now.
