What's cooking in git.git (Nov 2016, #05; Wed, 23)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* jc/for-each-ref-head-segfault-fix (2016-11-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-11-21 at 3c1f352316)
 + for-each-ref: do not segv with %(HEAD) on an unborn branch

 Using a %(HEAD) placeholder in "for-each-ref --format=" option
 caused the command to segfault when on an unborn branch.


* jc/setup-cleanup-fix (2016-11-22) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-11-23 at e46785ec9c)
 + archive: read local configuration
 + mailinfo: read local configuration

 "git archive" and "git mailinfo" stopped reading from local
 configuration file with a recent update.


* js/prepare-sequencer (2016-11-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-11-21 at 7cdf4ca421)
 + i18n: fix unmatched single quote in error message

 Fix for an error message string.


* js/rebase-i-commentchar-fix (2016-11-21) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-11-22 at 88581dfe2e)
 + rebase -i: handle core.commentChar=auto
 + stripspace: respect repository config
 + rebase -i: highlight problems with core.commentchar

 "git rebase -i" did not work well with core.commentchar
 configuration variable for two reasons, both of which have been
 fixed.


* jt/trailer-with-cruft (2016-11-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-11-22 at c68014088a)
 + doc: mention user-configured trailers

 Doc update.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* jc/cache-tree-wip (2016-11-18) 4 commits
 - cache-tree: freshen the tree object at the top level
 - cache-tree: retire cache_tree_fully_valid() API function
 - commit: remove redundant check for active_cache_changed
 - freshen_object(): factor out a helper function


* bw/push-dry-run (2016-11-23) 2 commits
 - push: fix --dry-run to not push submodules
 - push: --dry-run updates submodules when --recurse-submodules=on-demand
 (this branch uses hv/submodule-not-yet-pushed-fix.)


* jk/rev-parse-symbolic-parents-fix (2016-11-16) 1 commit
 - rev-parse: fix parent shorthands with --symbolic


* nd/worktree-list-fixup (2016-11-23) 3 commits
 - worktree list: keep the list sorted
 - get_worktrees() must return main worktree as first item even on error
 - worktree.c: zero new 'struct worktree' on allocation
 (this branch is used by nd/worktree-move.)

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* sb/push-make-submodule-check-the-default (2016-10-10) 2 commits
 - push: change submodule default to check when submodules exist
 - submodule add: extend force flag to add existing repos

 Turn the default of "push.recurseSubmodules" to "check" when
 submodules seem to be in use.

 Will hold to wait for hv/submodule-not-yet-pushed-fix


* jc/bundle (2016-03-03) 6 commits
 - index-pack: --clone-bundle option
 - Merge branch 'jc/index-pack' into jc/bundle
 - bundle v3: the beginning
 - bundle: keep a copy of bundle file name in the in-core bundle header
 - bundle: plug resource leak
 - bundle doc: 'verify' is not about verifying the bundle

 The beginning of "split bundle", which could be one of the
 ingredients to allow "git clone" traffic off of the core server
 network to CDN.

 While I think it would make it easier for people to experiment and
 build on if the topic is merged to 'next', I am at the same time a
 bit reluctant to merge an unproven new topic that introduces a new
 file format, which we may end up having to support til the end of
 time.  It is likely that to support a "prime clone from CDN", it
 would need a lot more than just "these are the heads and the pack
 data is over there", so this may not be sufficient.

 Will discard.


* mh/connect (2016-06-06) 10 commits
 - connect: [host:port] is legacy for ssh
 - connect: move ssh command line preparation to a separate function
 - connect: actively reject git:// urls with a user part
 - connect: change the --diag-url output to separate user and host
 - connect: make parse_connect_url() return the user part of the url as a separate value
 - connect: group CONNECT_DIAG_URL handling code
 - connect: make parse_connect_url() return separated host and port
 - connect: re-derive a host:port string from the separate host and port variables
 - connect: call get_host_and_port() earlier
 - connect: document why we sometimes call get_port after get_host_and_port

 Rewrite Git-URL parsing routine (hopefully) without changing any
 behaviour.

 It has been two months without any support.  We may want to discard
 this.


* ec/annotate-deleted (2015-11-20) 1 commit
 - annotate: skip checking working tree if a revision is provided

 Usability fix for annotate-specific "<file> <rev>" syntax with deleted
 files.

 Has been waiting for a review for too long without seeing anything.

 Will discard.


* dk/gc-more-wo-pack (2016-01-13) 4 commits
 - gc: clean garbage .bitmap files from pack dir
 - t5304: ensure non-garbage files are not deleted
 - t5304: test .bitmap garbage files
 - prepare_packed_git(): find more garbage

 Follow-on to dk/gc-idx-wo-pack topic, to clean up stale
 .bitmap and .keep files.

 Has been waiting for a reroll for too long.
 cf. <xmqq60ypbeng.fsf@gitster.mtv.corp.google.com>

 Will discard.


* jc/diff-b-m (2015-02-23) 5 commits
 . WIPWIP
 . WIP: diff-b-m
 - diffcore-rename: allow easier debugging
 - diffcore-rename.c: add locate_rename_src()
 - diffcore-break: allow debugging

 "git diff -B -M" produced incorrect patch when the postimage of a
 completely rewritten file is similar to the preimage of a removed
 file; such a resulting file must not be expressed as a rename from
 other place.

 The fix in this patch is broken, unfortunately.

 Will discard.

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* jk/trailers-placeholder-in-pretty (2016-11-21) 2 commits
 - ref-filter: add support to display trailers as part of contents
 - pretty: add %(trailers) format for displaying trailers of a commit message


* sb/submodule-intern-gitdir (2016-11-22) 5 commits
 - SQUASH
 - submodule: add embed-git-dir function
 - test-lib-functions.sh: teach test_commit -C <dir>
 - submodule helper: support super prefix
 - submodule: use absolute path for computing relative path connecting


* dt/empty-submodule-in-merge (2016-11-17) 1 commit
 - submodules: allow empty working-tree dirs in merge/cherry-pick

 An empty directory in a working tree that can simply be nuked used
 to interfere while merging or cherry-picking a change to create a
 submodule directory there, which has been fixed..

 Waiting for review.


* bw/grep-recurse-submodules (2016-11-22) 6 commits
 - grep: search history of moved submodules
 - grep: enable recurse-submodules to work on <tree> objects
 - grep: optionally recurse into submodules
 - grep: add submodules as a grep source type
 - submodules: load gitmodules file from commit sha1
 - submodules: add helper functions to determine presence of submodules

 "git grep" learns to optionally recurse into submodules


* dt/smart-http-detect-server-going-away (2016-11-18) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-11-21 at d502523347)
 + upload-pack: optionally allow fetching any sha1
 + remote-curl: don't hang when a server dies before any output

 When the http server gives an incomplete response to a smart-http
 rpc call, it could lead to client waiting for a full response that
 will never come.  Teach the client side to notice this condition
 and abort the transfer.

 An improvement counterproposal has failed.
 cf. <20161114194049.mktpsvgdhex2f4zv@sigill.intra.peff.net>

 Will cook in 'next'.


* mm/push-social-engineering-attack-doc (2016-11-14) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-11-16 at b7c1b27563)
 + doc: mention transfer data leaks in more places

 Doc update on fetching and pushing.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* nd/worktree-move (2016-11-23) 11 commits
 . worktree remove: new command
 . worktree move: refuse to move worktrees with submodules
 . worktree move: accept destination as directory
 . worktree move: new command
 . worktree.c: add update_worktree_location()
 . worktree.c: add validate_worktree()
 . copy.c: convert copy_file() to copy_dir_recursively()
 . copy.c: style fix
 . copy.c: convert bb_(p)error_msg to error(_errno)
 . copy.c: delete unused code in copy_file()
 . copy.c: import copy_file() from busybox
 (this branch uses nd/worktree-list-fixup.)

 "git worktree" learned move and remove subcommands.

 Reported to break builds on Windows.  Perhaps it should just spawn
 "cp -R" or something.


* jc/compression-config (2016-11-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-11-23 at b3c9254897)
 + compression: unify pack.compression configuration parsing

 Compression setting for producing packfiles were spread across
 three codepaths, one of which did not honor any configuration.
 Unify these so that all of them honor core.compression and
 pack.compression variables the same way.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* mm/gc-safety-doc (2016-11-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-11-17 at fc0d225b6b)
 + git-gc.txt: expand discussion of races with other processes

 Doc update.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* hv/submodule-not-yet-pushed-fix (2016-11-16) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-11-21 at 1a599af962)
 + submodule_needs_pushing(): explain the behaviour when we cannot answer
 + batch check whether submodule needs pushing into one call
 + serialize collection of refs that contain submodule changes
 + serialize collection of changed submodules
 (this branch is used by bw/push-dry-run.)

 The code in "git push" to compute if any commit being pushed in the
 superproject binds a commit in a submodule that hasn't been pushed
 out was overly inefficient, making it unusable even for a small
 project that does not have any submodule but have a reasonable
 number of refs.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* kn/ref-filter-branch-list (2016-11-15) 18 commits
 - for-each-ref: do not segv with %(HEAD) on an unborn branch
 - branch: implement '--format' option
 - branch: use ref-filter printing APIs
 - branch, tag: use porcelain output
 - ref-filter: allow porcelain to translate messages in the output
 - ref-filter: add `:dir` and `:base` options for ref printing atoms
 - ref-filter: make remote_ref_atom_parser() use refname_atom_parser_internal()
 - ref-filter: introduce symref_atom_parser() and refname_atom_parser()
 - ref-filter: introduce refname_atom_parser_internal()
 - ref-filter: make "%(symref)" atom work with the ':short' modifier
 - ref-filter: add support for %(upstream:track,nobracket)
 - ref-filter: make %(upstream:track) prints "[gone]" for invalid upstreams
 - ref-filter: introduce format_ref_array_item()
 - ref-filter: move get_head_description() from branch.c
 - ref-filter: modify "%(objectname:short)" to take length
 - ref-filter: implement %(if:equals=<string>) and %(if:notequals=<string>)
 - ref-filter: include reference to 'used_atom' within 'atom_value'
 - ref-filter: implement %(if), %(then), and %(else) atoms

 The code to list branches in "git branch" has been consolidated
 with the more generic ref-filter API.

 Rerolled, reviewed, looking good.
 Expecting a reroll.

* bw/transport-protocol-policy (2016-11-09) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-11-16 at 1391d3eeed)
 + transport: add protocol policy config option
 + lib-proto-disable: variable name fix

 Finer-grained control of what protocols are allowed for transports
 during clone/fetch/push have been enabled via a new configuration
 mechanism.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* jt/fetch-no-redundant-tag-fetch-map (2016-11-11) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-11-16 at 5846c27cc5)
 + fetch: do not redundantly calculate tag refmap

 Code cleanup to avoid using redundant refspecs while fetching with
 the --tags option.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* jc/retire-compaction-heuristics (2016-11-02) 3 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - SQUASH???
 - diff: retire the original experimental "compaction" heuristics

 Waiting for a reroll.


* jc/abbrev-autoscale-config (2016-11-01) 1 commit
 - config.abbrev: document the new default that auto-scales

 Waiting for a reroll.


* jk/nofollow-attr-ignore (2016-11-02) 5 commits
 - exclude: do not respect symlinks for in-tree .gitignore
 - attr: do not respect symlinks for in-tree .gitattributes
 - exclude: convert "check_index" into a flags field
 - attr: convert "macro_ok" into a flags field
 - add open_nofollow() helper

 As we do not follow symbolic links when reading control files like
 .gitignore and .gitattributes from the index, match the behaviour
 and not follow symbolic links when reading them from the working
 tree.  This also tightens security a bit by not leaking contents of
 an unrelated file in the error messages when it is pointed at by
 one of these files that is a symbolic link.

 Perhaps we want to cover .gitmodules too with the same mechanism?


* sb/submodule-config-cleanup (2016-11-22) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-11-23 at c02e578b49)
 + submodule-config: clarify parsing of null_sha1 element
 + submodule-config: rename commit_sha1 to treeish_name
 + submodule config: inline config_from_{name, path}

 Minor code clean-up.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* jc/push-default-explicit (2016-10-31) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-11-01 at 8dc3a6cf25)
 + push: test pushing ambiguously named branches
 + push: do not use potentially ambiguous default refspec

 A lazy "git push" without refspec did not internally use a fully
 specified refspec to perform 'current', 'simple', or 'upstream'
 push, causing unnecessary "ambiguous ref" errors.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* jt/use-trailer-api-in-commands (2016-11-02) 6 commits
 - sequencer: use trailer's trailer layout
 - trailer: have function to describe trailer layout
 - trailer: avoid unnecessary splitting on lines
 - commit: make ignore_non_trailer take buf/len
 - SQUASH???
 - trailer: be stricter in parsing separators

 Commands that operate on a log message and add lines to the trailer
 blocks, such as "format-patch -s", "cherry-pick (-x|-s)", and
 "commit -s", have been taught to use the logic of and share the
 code with "git interpret-trailer".

 What's the doneness of this topic?


* nd/rebase-forget (2016-10-28) 1 commit
 - rebase: add --forget to cleanup rebase, leave HEAD untouched

 "git rebase" learned "--forget" option, which allows a user to
 remove the metadata left by an earlier "git rebase" that was
 manually aborted without using "git rebase --abort".

 Waiting for a reroll.


* jc/git-open-cloexec (2016-11-02) 3 commits
 - sha1_file: stop opening files with O_NOATIME
 - git_open_cloexec(): use fcntl(2) w/ FD_CLOEXEC fallback
 - git_open(): untangle possible NOATIME and CLOEXEC interactions

 The codeflow of setting NOATIME and CLOEXEC on file descriptors Git
 opens has been simplified.

 We may want to drop the tip one.


* jk/no-looking-at-dotgit-outside-repo-final (2016-10-26) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-10-26 at 220e160451)
 + setup_git_env: avoid blind fall-back to ".git"

 This is the endgame of the topic to avoid blindly falling back to
 ".git" when the setup sequence said we are _not_ in Git repository.
 A corner case that happens to work right now may be broken by a
 call to die("BUG").

 Will cook in 'next'.


* jc/reset-unmerge (2016-10-24) 1 commit
 - reset: --unmerge

 After "git add" is run prematurely during a conflict resolution,
 "git diff" can no longer be used as a way to sanity check by
 looking at the combined diff.  "git reset" learned a new
 "--unmerge" option to recover from this situation.

 Will discard.
 This may not be needed, given that update-index has a similar
 option.


* jc/merge-base-fp-only (2016-10-19) 8 commits
 . merge-base: fp experiment
 - merge: allow to use only the fp-only merge bases
 - merge-base: limit the output to bases that are on first-parent chain
 - merge-base: mark bases that are on first-parent chain
 - merge-base: expose get_merge_bases_many_0() a bit more
 - merge-base: stop moving commits around in remove_redundant()
 - sha1_name: remove ONELINE_SEEN bit
 - commit: simplify fastpath of merge-base

 An experiment of merge-base that ignores common ancestors that are
 not on the first parent chain.

 Will discard.
 The whole premise feels wrong.


* tb/convert-stream-check (2016-10-27) 2 commits
 - convert.c: stream and fast search for binary
 - read-cache: factor out get_sha1_from_index() helper

 End-of-line conversion sometimes needs to see if the current blob
 in the index has NULs and CRs to base its decision.  We used to
 always get a full statistics over the blob, but in many cases we
 can return early when we have seen "enough" (e.g. if we see a
 single NUL, the blob will be handled as binary).  The codepaths
 have been optimized by using streaming interface.

 Will discard.
 Retracted.
 cf. <20161102071646.GA5094@tb-raspi>


* pb/bisect (2016-10-18) 27 commits

 - bisect--helper: `write_terms` shell function in C
 - bisect: rewrite `check_term_format` shell function in C
 - bisect--helper: use OPT_CMDMODE instead of OPT_BOOL

 Move more parts of "git bisect" to C.

 Waiting for review.

 - builtin/verify-tag: add --format to verify-tag
 - tag: add format specifier to gpg_verify_tag
 - ref-filter: add function to print single ref_array_item
 - gpg-interface, tag: add GPG_VERIFY_QUIET flag

 "git tag" and "git verify-tag" learned to put GPG verification
 status in their "--format=<placeholders>" output format.

 Waiting for a reroll.

 - commit.c: use strchrnul() to scan for one line

 The attributes API has been updated so that it can later be
 optimized using the knowledge of which attributes are queried.
 Building on top of the updated API, the pathspec machinery learned
 to select only paths with given attributes set.

 Waiting for review.

 Waiting for review.


* jc/latin-1 (2016-09-26) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-09-28 at c8673e03c2)
 + utf8: accept "latin-1" as ISO-8859-1
 + utf8: refactor code to decide fallback encoding

 Some platforms no longer understand "latin-1" that is still seen in
 the wild in e-mail headers; replace them with "iso-8859-1" that is
 more widely known when conversion fails from/to it.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* sg/fix-versioncmp-with-common-suffix (2016-09-08) 5 commits
 - versioncmp: cope with common leading parts in versionsort.prereleaseSuffix
 - versioncmp: pass full tagnames to swap_prereleases()
 - t7004-tag: add version sort tests to show prerelease reordering issues
 - t7004-tag: use test_config helper
 - t7004-tag: delete unnecessary tags with test_when_finished

 The prereleaseSuffix feature of version comparison that is used in
 "git tag -l" did not correctly when two or more prereleases for the
 same release were present (e.g. when 2.0, 2.0-beta1, and 2.0-beta2
 are there and the code needs to compare 2.0-beta1 and 2.0-beta2).

 Waiting for a reroll.

* jc/pull-rebase-ff (2016-07-28) 1 commit
 - pull: fast-forward "pull --rebase=true"

 "git pull --rebase", when there is no new commits on our side since
 we forked from the upstream, should be able to fast-forward without
 invoking "git rebase", but it didn't.

 Needs a real log message and a few tests.


* jc/merge-drop-old-syntax (2015-04-29) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-10-11 at 8928c8b9b3)
 + merge: drop 'git merge <message> HEAD <commit>' syntax

 Stop supporting "git merge <message> HEAD <commit>" syntax that has
