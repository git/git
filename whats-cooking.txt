What's cooking in git.git (Jan 2010, #05; Sat, 16)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones
marked with '.' do not appear in any of the integration branches, but I am
still holding onto them.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* dp/maint-1.6.5-fast-import-non-commit-tag (2010-01-14) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-01-16 at f95ea8e)
 + fast-import: tag may point to any object type

* il/push-set-upstream (2010-01-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-01-16 at e3a7a60)
 + Add push --set-upstream

* js/windows (2010-01-15) 7 commits
 - Do not use date.c:tm_to_time_t() from compat/mingw.c
 - MSVC: Windows-native implementation for subset of Pthreads API
 - MSVC: Fix an "incompatible pointer types" compiler warning
 - Windows: avoid the "dup dance" when spawning a child process
 - Windows: simplify the pipe(2) implementation
 - Windows: boost startup by avoiding a static dependency on shell32.dll
 - Windows: disable Python

* nd/status-partial-refresh (2010-01-14) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-01-16 at f77bc8f)
 + status: only touch path we may need to check

* rr/core-tutorial (2010-01-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-01-16 at d9dd8bd)
 + Documentation: Update git core tutorial clarifying reference to scripts

* jc/conflict-mark-len-attr (2010-01-16) 3 commits
 . WIP : honor conflict-marker-lenght in rerere (does not work yet)
 . rerere: use ll_merge() instead of using xdl_merge()
 . conflict-marker-length: new attribute
 (this branch uses jc/cache-unmerge.)

I am attempting to introduce a new per-path attribute to specify
non-default conflict marker length to help rerere grok conflicts in
Documentation/git-merge.txt, but the series is not yet in a presentable
state yet.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* ap/merge-backend-opts (2008-07-18) 6 commits
 - Document that merge strategies can now take their own options
 - Extend merge-subtree tests to test -Xsubtree=dir.
 - Make "subtree" part more orthogonal to the rest of merge-recursive.
 - Teach git-pull to pass -X<option> to git-merge
 - git merge -X<option>
 - git-merge-file --ours, --theirs

"git pull" patch needs sq-then-eval fix to protect it from $IFS
but otherwise seemed good.

* js/refer-upstream (2009-09-10) 1 commit
 - Introduce <branch>@{upstream} notation

This does not teach the public interface about the new syntax; callers
that care about distinction between name vs SHA-1 might not work as well
as they should.

* jh/notes (2009-12-07) 11 commits
 - Refactor notes concatenation into a flexible interface for combining notes
 - Notes API: Allow multiple concurrent notes trees with new struct notes_tree
 - Notes API: for_each_note(): Traverse the entire notes tree with a callback
 - Notes API: get_note(): Return the note annotating the given object
 - Notes API: add_note(): Add note objects to the internal notes tree structure
 - Notes API: init_notes(): Initialize the notes tree from the given notes ref
 - Notes API: get_commit_notes() -> format_note() + remove the commit restriction
 - Minor style fixes to notes.c
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-01-02 at ae42130)
 + Add more testcases to test fast-import of notes
 + Rename t9301 to t9350, to make room for more fast-import tests
 + fast-import: Proper notes tree manipulation

http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/134738

What's the status of the fourth and later patches on this topic?  Overall
it looked reasonable, if I recall correctly what I thought when I reviewed
it last time, and I am tempted to merge it to 'next' soonish.  Please
file complaints before I do so if people have objections.

Hold: JH on 2010-01-05, http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/136183

[Cooking]

Mark file-local symbols "static", and remove unused functions.  Daniel

I don't think of a good description myself.
