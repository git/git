What's cooking in git.git (Feb 2022, #04; Tue, 15)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen',
which means nothing more than that I have found them of interest for
some reason (like "it may have hard-to-resolve conflicts with
another topic already in flight" or "this may turn out to be
useful").  Do not read too much into a topic being in (or not in)
'seen'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of the
integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

Many new topics have sketchy or even empty topic description in the
list below; help to fill them in is very much appreciated ;-)

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

* je/http-better-error-output (2021-12-03) 1 commit
 . http-backend: give a hint that web browser access is not supported

 When the http-backend program, which is the server-side component
 for the smart HTTP transport, sends a "404 Not found" error, we
 deliberately did not say anything to the requesting client.  We now
 send a message back to the browser to tell the user that they do
 not want to visit the URL via their browser, instead of a totally
 blank page.

 Expecting a reroll.
 Breaks its self tests.

 - t5526: introduce test helper to assert on fetches

 - submodule: store new submodule commits oid_array in a struct
 - submodule: inline submodule_commits() into caller

 When "git fetch --recurse-submodules" grabbed submodule commits
 that would be needed to recursively check out newly fetched commits
 in the superproject, it only paid attention to submodules that are
 in the current checkout of the superproject.  We now do so for all
 submodules that have been run "git submodule init" on.

 "git log --graph --graph" used to leak a graph structure, and there
 was no way to countermand "--graph" that appear earlier on the

 leakage has been plugged.

* js/apply-partial-clone-filters-recursively (2022-02-09) 1 commit
 - clone, submodule: pass partial clone filters to submodules

 "git clone --filter=... --recurse-submodules" only makes the
 top-level a partial clone, while submodules are fully cloned.  This
 behaviour is changed to pass the same filter down to the submodules.

* rs/bisect-executable-not-found (2022-01-19) 4 commits
 - bisect--helper: double-check run command on exit code 126 and 127
 - bisect: document run behavior with exit codes 126 and 127
 - bisect--helper: release strbuf and strvec on run error
 - bisect--helper: report actual bisect_state() argument on error

 A not-so-common mistake is to write a script to feed "git bisect
 run" without making it executable, in which case all tests will
 exit with 126 or 127 error codes, even on revisions that are marked
 as good.  Try to recoginse this situation and stop iteration early.

  (merged to 'next' on 2022-02-10 at 4866a64508)
 + refs: skip hooks when deleting uncovered packed refs
 + refs: do not execute reference-transaction hook on packing refs
 + refs: demonstrate excessive execution of the reference-transaction hook
 + refs: allow skipping the reference-transaction hook
 + refs: allow passing flags when beginning transactions
 + refs: extract packed_refs_delete_refs() to allow control of transaction

 Because a deletion of ref would need to remove it from both the
 loose ref store and the packed ref store, a delete-ref operation
 that logically removes one ref may end up invoking ref-transaction
 hook twice, which has been corrected.

 In sparse-checkouts, files mis-marked as missing from the working tree
 could lead to later problems.  Such files were hard to discover, and
 harder to correct.  Automatically detecting and correcting the marking
 of such files has been added to avoid these problems.

 - grep.c: don't pass along NULL callback value
 - built-ins: trust the "prefix" from run_builtin()
 - grep tests: add missing "grep.patternType" config tests
 - log tests: check if grep_config() is called by "log"-like cmds
 - grep.h: remove unused "regex_t regexp" from grep_opt

 Some code clean-up in the "git grep" machinery.

 Looking good, except for the last step.
 Code-wise, it is tempted to call it a victory after squashing the
 fix-up in, but that does not fix the proposed log message, so...

 Expecting a reroll to update its tests, but otherwise looks ready.
