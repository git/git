What's cooking in git.git (Feb 2024, #09; Tue, 27)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and
aren't considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL
to a message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity (of course they can be resubmit when new interests
arise).

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/

 "git apply" on a filesystem without filemode support have learned
 to take a hint from what is in the index for the path, even when
 not working with the "--index" or "--cached" option, when checking
 the executable bit match what is required by the preimage in the
 patch.

 - reftable: allow inlining of a few functions
 - reftable/record: decode keys in place
 - reftable/record: reuse refname when copying
 - reftable/record: reuse refname when decoding
 - reftable/merged: avoid duplicate pqueue emptiness check

 The code to iterate over refs with the reftable backend has seen
 some optimization.

 Needs review.

* cp/t9146-use-test-path-helpers (2024-02-14) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2024-02-21 at 0b8356ef33)
 + t9146: replace test -d/-e/-f with appropriate test_path_is_* function

 Test script clean-up.

 Will merge to 'master'.

* js/cmake-with-test-tool (2024-02-23) 2 commits
 - cmake: let `test-tool` run the unit tests, too
 - Merge branch 'js/unit-test-suite-runner' into js/cmake-with-test-tool
 (this branch uses js/unit-test-suite-runner.)

 "test-tool" is now built in CMake build to also run the unit tests.

 May want to roll it into the base topic.

* kn/for-all-refs (2024-02-23) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2024-02-27 at aef2406cca)
 + for-each-ref: add new option to include root refs
 + ref-filter: rename 'FILTER_REFS_ALL' to 'FILTER_REFS_REGULAR'
 + refs: introduce `refs_for_each_include_root_refs()`
 + refs: extract out `loose_fill_ref_dir_regular_file()`
 + refs: introduce `is_pseudoref()` and `is_headref()`
 + Merge branch 'ps/reftable-backend' into kn/for-all-refs

 "git for-each-ref" filters its output with prefixes given from the
 command line, but it did not honor an empty string to mean "pass
 everything", which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.

* jc/no-lazy-fetch (2024-02-27) 3 commits
 - git: extend --no-lazy-fetch to work across subprocesses
 - git: document GIT_NO_REPLACE_OBJECTS environment variable
  (merged to 'next' on 2024-02-13 at 7c7136e547)
 + git: --no-lazy-fetch option

 "git --no-lazy-fetch cmd" allows to run "cmd" while disabling lazy
 fetching of objects from the promisor remote, which may be handy
 for debugging.

* js/unit-test-suite-runner (2024-02-23) 8 commits
 - ci: use test-tool as unit test runner on Windows
 - t/Makefile: run unit tests alongside shell tests
 - unit tests: add rule for running with test-tool
 - test-tool run-command testsuite: support unit tests
 - test-tool run-command testsuite: remove hardcoded filter

 - Merge branch 'jk/unit-tests-buildfix' into js/unit-test-suite-runner
 (this branch is used by js/cmake-with-test-tool.)

 The "test-tool" has been taught to run testsuite tests in parallel,
 bypassing the need to use the "prove" tool.

 Needs review.

* cc/rev-list-allow-missing-tips (2024-02-14) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2024-02-21 at 9b63eec23f)

 + t6022: fix 'test' style and 'even though' typo
 + oidset: refactor oidset_insert_from_set()
 + revision: clarify a 'return NULL' in get_reference()

 "git rev-list --missing=print" has learned to optionally take
 "--allow-missing-tips", which allows the objects at the starting
 points to be missing.

 Will merge to 'master'.

* js/merge-tree-3-trees (2024-02-23) 7 commits

  (merged to 'next' on 2024-01-30 at 0c77b04e59)
 + merge-tree: accept 3 trees as arguments

 "git merge-tree" has learned that the three trees involved in the
 3-way merge only need to be trees, not necessarily commits.

 The command line completion script (in contrib/) learned to

 "git log --merge" learned to pay attention to CHERRY_PICK_HEAD and
 other kinds of *_HEAD pseudorefs.

 - completion: don't complete revs when --no-format-patch

 Command line completion support (in contrib/) has been taught to
 avoid offering revision names as candidates to "git send-email" when
 the command is used to send pre-generated files.

 on systems whose "char" is unsigned; update the implementation and
 bump the format version to 2.
