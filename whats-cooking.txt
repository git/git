What's cooking in git.git (Feb 2014, #07; Tue, 25)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.

The tip of 'next' has been rewound.  There are healthy number of
topics in there that have been well-cooked during the 1.9.0
development cycle that can graduate to 'master' (see the announce in
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/242658).
After they are merged to 'master', I'm planning to go back to the
list archive to pick up patches I may have missed in the meantime.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* ak/gitweb-fit-image (2014-02-20) 1 commit
 - gitweb: Avoid overflowing page body frame with large images

 Instead of allowing an <img> to be shown in whatever size, force
 scaling it to fit on the page with max-height/max-width css style
 attributes.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* da/difftool-git-files (2014-02-24) 1 commit
 - difftool: support repositories with .git-files

 "git difftool" misbehaved when the repository is bound to the
 working tree with the ".git file" mechanism, where a textual
 file ".git" tells us where it is.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/commit-dates-parsing-fix (2014-02-24) 5 commits
 - log: do not segfault on gmtime errors
 - log: handle integer overflow in timestamps
 - date: check date overflow against time_t
 - fsck: report integer overflow in author timestamps
 - t4212: test bogus timestamps with git-log

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/diff-filespec-cleanup (2014-02-24) 1 commit
 - diffcore.h: be explicit about the signedness of is_binary

 Will merge to 'next' and then to 'master' and 'maint'.


* jk/remote-pushremote-config-reading (2014-02-24) 1 commit
 - remote: handle pushremote config in any order

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/repack-pack-keep-objects (2014-02-24) 1 commit
 - repack: add `repack.packKeepObjects` config var
 (this branch uses jk/pack-bitmap.)

 Names?


* jm/stash-doc-k-for-keep (2014-02-24) 1 commit
 - stash doc: mention short form -k in save description

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jn/am-doc-hooks (2014-02-24) 1 commit
 - am doc: add a pointer to relevant hooks

 Will merge to 'next'.


* mh/object-code-cleanup (2014-02-24) 4 commits
 - sha1_file.c: document a bunch of functions defined in the file
 - sha1_file_name(): declare to return a const string
 - find_pack_entry(): document last_found_pack
 - replace_object: use struct members instead of an array

 Will merge to 'next'.


* nd/i18n-progress (2014-02-24) 1 commit
 - i18n: mark all progress lines for translation

 Will merge to 'next'.


* nd/sha1-file-delta-stack-leakage-fix (2014-02-24) 1 commit
 - sha1_file: fix delta_stack memory leak in unpack_entry

 Will merge to 'next' and then to 'master' and 'maint'.


* tc/commit-dry-run-exit-status-tests (2014-02-24) 1 commit
 - demonstrate git-commit --dry-run exit code behaviour

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* kb/fast-hashmap-pack-struct (2014-02-24) 1 commit
 - hashmap.h: make sure map entries are tightly packed
 (this branch uses kb/fast-hashmap.)

 I am inclined to drop this; an alternative is to replace it with
 the "more portable" one that uses #pragma, which I am willing to
 try doing so on 'pu', though.


* po/everyday-doc (2014-01-27) 1 commit
 - Make 'git help everyday' work

 This may make the said command to emit something, but the source is
 not meant to be formatted into a manual pages to begin with, and
 also its contents are a bit stale.  It may be a good first step in
 the right direction, but needs more work to at least get the
 mark-up right before public consumption.

 Will hold.


* jk/branch-at-publish-rebased (2014-01-17) 5 commits
 - t1507 (rev-parse-upstream): fix typo in test title
 - implement @{publish} shorthand
 - branch_get: provide per-branch pushremote pointers
 - branch_get: return early on error
 - sha1_name: refactor upstream_mark

 Give an easier access to the tracking branches from "other" side in
 a triangular workflow by introducing B@{publish} that works in a
 similar way to how B@{upstream} does.

 Meant to be used as a basis for whatever Ram wants to build on.

 Will hold.


* rb/merge-prepare-commit-msg-hook (2014-01-10) 4 commits
 - merge: drop unused arg from abort_commit method signature
 - merge: make prepare_to_commit responsible for write_merge_state
 - t7505: ensure cleanup after hook blocks merge
 - t7505: add missing &&

 Expose more merge states (e.g. $GIT_DIR/MERGE_MODE) to hooks that
 run during "git merge".  The log message stresses too much on one
 hook, prepare-commit-msg, but it would equally apply to other hooks
 like post-merge, I think.

 Waiting for a reroll.


* jl/submodule-recursive-checkout (2013-12-26) 5 commits
 - Teach checkout to recursively checkout submodules
 - submodule: teach unpack_trees() to update submodules
 - submodule: teach unpack_trees() to repopulate submodules
 - submodule: teach unpack_trees() to remove submodule contents
 - submodule: prepare for recursive checkout of submodules

 Expecting a reroll.


* jc/graph-post-root-gap (2013-12-30) 3 commits
 - WIP: document what we want at the end
 - graph: remove unused code a bit
 - graph: stuff the current commit into graph->columns[]

 This was primarily a RFH ($gmane/239580).


* fc/completion (2013-12-09) 1 commit
 - completion: fix completion of certain aliases

 SZEDER Gábor noticed that this breaks "git -c var=val alias" and
 also suggested a better description of the change.

 Has been stalled for a while without much comments from anybody
 interested.

 Will discard.


* mo/subtree-split-updates (2013-12-10) 3 commits
 - subtree: add --edit option
 - subtree: allow --squash and --message with push
 - subtree: support split --rejoin --squash

 Has been stalled for a while without much comments from anybody
 interested.

 Will discard.


* hv/submodule-ignore-fix (2013-12-06) 4 commits
 - disable complete ignorance of submodules for index <-> HEAD diff
 - always show committed submodules in summary after commit
 - teach add -f option for ignored submodules
 - fix 'git add' to skip submodules configured as ignored

 Teach "git add" to be consistent with "git status" when changes to
 submodules are set to be ignored, to avoid surprises after checking
 with "git status" to see there isn't any change to be further added
 and then see that "git add ." adds changes to them.

 I think a reroll is coming, so this may need to be replaced, but I
 needed some practice with heavy conflict resolution.  It conflicts
 with two changes to "git add" that have been scheduled for Git 2.0
 quite badly, and I think I got the resolution right this time.

 Waiting for a reroll.


* jc/create-directories-microopt (2013-11-11) 1 commit
 - checkout: most of the time we have good leading directories

 Of unknown value until tested on non-Linux platforms (especially
 Windows).

 Will discard.


* jt/commit-fixes-footer (2013-10-30) 1 commit
 - commit: Add -f, --fixes <commit> option to add Fixes: line

 There is an ongoing discussion around this topic; in general I am
 fairly negative on a new feature that is too narrow and prefer a
 more generic solution that can be tailored for specific needs, as
 many people stated in the thread.

 cc/interpret-trailers could be such a generic solution (although
 there don't seem to be much concensus yet).

 Will discard.


* np/pack-v4 (2013-09-18) 90 commits
 . packv4-parse.c: add tree offset caching
 . t1050: replace one instance of show-index with verify-pack
 . index-pack, pack-objects: allow creating .idx v2 with .pack v4
 . unpack-objects: decode v4 trees
 . unpack-objects: allow to save processed bytes to a buffer
 - ...

 Nico and Duy advancing the eternal vaporware pack-v4.  This is here
 primarily for wider distribution of the preview edition.

 Temporarily ejected from 'pu', to try out jk/pack-bitmap, which
 this topic conflicts with.


* mf/graph-show-root (2013-10-25) 1 commit
 . graph.c: mark root commit differently

 In a repository with multiple-roots, "log --graph", especially with
 "--oneline", does not give the reader enough visual cue to see
 where one line of history ended and a separate history began.

 This is the version that marks the roots 'x' when they would have
 been marked as '*'; Keshav Kini suggested an alternative of giving
 an extra blank line after every root, which I tend to think is a
 better approach to the problem.

 Will discard.


* tg/perf-lib-test-perf-cleanup (2013-09-19) 2 commits
 - perf-lib: add test_perf_cleanup target
 - perf-lib: split starting the test from the execution

 Add test_perf_cleanup shell function to the perf suite, that allows
 the script writers to define a test with a clean-up action.

 Will hold.


* yt/shortened-rename (2013-10-18) 2 commits
 - SQUASH??? style fixes and s/omit/shorten/ where appropriate
 - diff.c: keep arrow(=>) on show_stats()'s shortened filename part to make rename visible

 Attempts to give more weight on the fact that a filepair represents
 a rename than showing substring of the actual path when diffstat
 lines are not wide enough.

 I am not sure if that is solving a right problem, though.

 Will discard.


* rv/send-email-cache-generated-mid (2013-08-21) 2 commits
 - git-send-email: Cache generated message-ids, use them when prompting
 - git-send-email: add optional 'choices' parameter to the ask sub

 Will discard.


* rj/read-default-config-in-show-ref-pack-refs (2013-06-17) 3 commits
 - ### DONTMERGE: needs better explanation on what config they need
 - pack-refs.c: Add missing call to git_config()
 - show-ref.c: Add missing call to git_config()

 The changes themselves are probably good, but it is unclear what
 basic setting needs to be read for which exact operation.

 Will discard, tired of waiting for clarification.
 $gmane/228294


* jc/format-patch (2013-04-22) 2 commits
 - format-patch: --inline-single
 - format-patch: rename "no_inline" field

 A new option to send a single patch to the standard output to be
 appended at the bottom of a message.  I personally have no need for
 this, but it was easy enough to cobble together.  Tests, docs and
 stripping out more MIMEy stuff are left as exercises to interested
 parties.


* jk/gitweb-utf8 (2013-04-08) 4 commits
 - gitweb: Fix broken blob action parameters on blob/commitdiff pages
 - gitweb: Don't append ';js=(0|1)' to external links
 - gitweb: Make feed title valid utf8
 - gitweb: Fix utf8 encoding for blob_plain, blobdiff_plain, commitdiff_plain, and patch

 Various fixes to gitweb.

 Drew Northup volunteered to take a look into this ($gmane/226216)
 but nothing seems to have happened since then.

 Will discard.


* jc/show-branch (2013-06-07) 5 commits
 - show-branch: use commit slab to represent bitflags of arbitrary width
 - show-branch.c: remove "all_mask"
 - show-branch.c: abstract out "flags" operation
 - show-branch.c: lift all_mask/all_revs to a global static
 - show-branch.c: update comment style

 Waiting for the final step to lift the hard-limit before sending it out.

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* fc/transport-helper-fixes (2014-02-24) 7 commits
 - remote-bzr: support the new 'force' option
 - test-hg.sh: tests are now expected to pass
 - transport-helper.c: do not overwrite forced bit
 - transport-helper: check for 'forced update' message
 - transport-helper: add 'force' to 'export' helpers
 - transport-helper: don't update refs in dry-run
 - transport-helper: mismerge fix

 Updates transport-helper, fast-import and fast-export to allow the
 ref mapping and ref deletion in a way similar to the natively
 supported transports.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* kb/fast-hashmap (2014-02-24) 18 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-02-25 at 88a98e6)
 + name-hash: retire unused index_name_exists()
 + hashmap.h: use 'unsigned int' for hash-codes everywhere
 + test-hashmap.c: drop unnecessary #includes
 + .gitignore: test-hashmap is a generated file
 + read-cache.c: fix memory leaks caused by removed cache entries
 + builtin/update-index.c: cleanup update_one
 + fix 'git update-index --verbose --again' output
 + remove old hash.[ch] implementation
 + name-hash.c: remove cache entries instead of marking them CE_UNHASHED
 + name-hash.c: use new hash map implementation for cache entries
 + name-hash.c: remove unreferenced directory entries
 + name-hash.c: use new hash map implementation for directories
 + diffcore-rename.c: use new hash map implementation
 + diffcore-rename.c: simplify finding exact renames
 + diffcore-rename.c: move code around to prepare for the next patch
 + buitin/describe.c: use new hash map implementation
 + add a hashtable implementation that supports O(1) removal
 + submodule: don't access the .gitmodules cache entry after removing it
 (this branch is used by kb/fast-hashmap-pack-struct.)

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2014-01-03

 Improvements to our hash table to get it to meet the needs of the
 msysgit fscache project, with some nice performance improvements.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* bc/blame-crlf-test (2014-02-18) 1 commit
 - blame: add a failing test for a CRLF issue.

 I have a feeling that a fix for this should be fairly isolated and
 trivial (it should be just the matter of paying attention to the
 crlf settings when synthesizing the fake commit)---perhaps somebody
 can squash in a fix to this?


* jk/http-no-curl-easy (2014-02-18) 1 commit
 - http: never use curl_easy_perform

 Avoid use of the curl-easy family of functions, which interferes
 with connection reuse in a negative way.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/janitorial-fixes (2014-02-18) 5 commits
 - open_istream(): do not dereference NULL in the error case
 - builtin/mv: don't use memory after free
 - utf8: use correct type for values in interval table
 - utf8: fix iconv error detection
 - notes-utils: handle boolean notes.rewritemode correctly

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ks/config-file-stdin (2014-02-18) 4 commits
 - config: teach "git config --file -" to read from the standard input
 - config: change git_config_with_options() interface
 - builtin/config.c: rename check_blob_write() -> check_write()
 - config: disallow relative include paths from blobs

 Will merge to 'next'.


* lb/contrib-contacts-looser-diff-parsing (2014-02-18) 1 commit
 - git-contacts: do not fail parsing of good diffs

 Will merge to 'next'.


* mh/replace-refs-variable-rename (2014-02-20) 1 commit
 - rename read_replace_refs to check_replace_refs

 Will merge to 'next'.


* nd/commit-editor-cleanup (2014-02-25) 3 commits
 - commit: add --cleanup=scissors
 - wt-status.c: move cut-line print code out to wt_status_add_cut_line
 - wt-status.c: make cut_line[] const to shrink .data section a bit

 "git commit --cleanup=<mode>" learned a new mode, scissors.


* nd/no-more-fnmatch (2014-02-20) 4 commits
 - actually remove compat fnmatch source code
 - stop using fnmatch (either native or compat)
 - Revert "test-wildmatch: add "perf" command to compare wildmatch and fnmatch"
 - use wildmatch() directly without fnmatch() wrapper

 We started using wildmatch() in place of fnmatch(3); complete the
 process and stop using fnmatch(3).

 Will merge to 'next'.


* nd/reset-setup-worktree (2014-02-18) 1 commit
 - reset: optionally setup worktree and refresh index on --mixed

 "git reset" needs to refresh the index when working in a working
 tree (it can also be used to match the index to the HEAD in an
 otherwise bare repository), but it failed to set up the working
 tree properly, causing GIT_WORK_TREE to be ignored.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* po/git-help-user-manual (2014-02-18) 1 commit
 - Provide a 'git help user-manual' route to the docbook

 I am not sure if this is even needed.


* rt/links-for-asciidoctor (2014-02-20) 1 commit
 - Documentation: fix documentation AsciiDoc links for external urls

 Will merge to 'next'.


* tg/index-v4-format (2014-02-24) 3 commits
 - read-cache: add index.version config variable
 - test-lib: allow setting the index format version
 - introduce GIT_INDEX_VERSION environment variable

 Will merge to 'next'.


* tr/diff-submodule-no-reuse-worktree (2014-02-18) 1 commit
 - diff: do not reuse_worktree_file for submodules

 "git diff --external-diff" incorrectly fed the submodule directory
 in the working tree to the external diff driver when it knew it is
 the same as one of the versions being compared.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* nd/multiple-work-trees (2014-02-19) 26 commits
 - FIXUP???
 - gc: support prune --repos
 - prune: strategies for linked checkouts
 - checkout: detach if the branch is already checked out elsewhere
 - checkout: clean up half-prepared directories in --to mode
 - checkout: support checking out into a new working directory
 - use new wrapper write_file() for simple file writing
 - wrapper.c: wrapper to open a file, fprintf then close

 - setup.c: detect $GIT_COMMON_DIR check_repository_format_gently()
 - setup.c: convert check_repository_format_gently to use strbuf
 - setup.c: detect $GIT_COMMON_DIR in is_git_directory()
 - setup.c: convert is_git_directory() to use strbuf
 - git-stash: avoid hardcoding $GIT_DIR/logs/....
 - *.sh: avoid hardcoding $GIT_DIR/hooks/...
 - git-sh-setup.sh: use rev-parse --git-path to get $GIT_DIR/objects
 - Add new environment variable $GIT_COMMON_DIR
 - commit: use SEQ_DIR instead of hardcoding "sequencer"
 - fast-import: use git_path() for accessing .git dir instead of get_git_dir()
 - reflog: avoid constructing .lock path with git_path
 - *.sh: respect $GIT_INDEX_FILE
 - Make git_path() aware of file relocation in $GIT_DIR
 - path.c: group git_path(), git_pathdup() and strbuf_git_path() together
 - path.c: rename vsnpath() to do_git_path()
 - Convert git_snpath() to strbuf_git_path()
 - path.c: make get_pathname() return strbuf instead of static buffer

 The tip commit needs to be dropped; the series needs a serious review.


* ks/tree-diff-nway (2014-02-24) 2 commits
 - combine-diff: speed it up, by using multiparent diff
 - tree-diff: rework diff_tree() to generate diffs for multiparent cases as well
 (this branch uses ks/combine-diff, ks/tree-diff-more and ks/tree-diff-walk.)

 Instead of running N pair-wise diff-trees when inspecting a
 N-parent merge, find the set of paths that were touched by walking
 N+1 trees in parallel.  These set of paths can then be turned into
 N pair-wise diff-tree results to be processed through rename
 detections and such.  And N=2 case nicely degenerates to the usual
 2-way diff-tree, which is very nice.

 Promising, but unfortunately the implementation seems a bit too
 unportable for such a core part of the system.

 Reroll is there, but have run out of time to pick it up this round.


* al/docs (2014-02-11) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-02-25 at 0c1a734)
 + docs/git-blame: explain more clearly the example pickaxe use
 + docs/git-clone: clarify use of --no-hardlinks option
 + docs/git-remote: capitalize first word of initial blurb
 + docs/merge-strategies: remove hyphen from mis-merges

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2014-02-13

 A handful of documentation updates, all trivially harmless.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/test-ports (2014-02-10) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-02-25 at 86ce2e4)
 + tests: auto-set git-daemon port
 + tests: auto-set LIB_HTTPD_PORT from test name
 (this branch is tangled with nd/http-fetch-shallow-fix.)

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2014-02-13

 Avoid having to assign port number to be used in tests manually.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* nd/daemonize-gc (2014-02-10) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-02-25 at f592335)
 + gc: config option for running --auto in background
 + daemon: move daemonize() to libgit.a

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2014-02-20

 Allow running "gc --auto" in the background.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* nd/gitignore-trailing-whitespace (2014-02-10) 2 commits
 - dir: ignore trailing spaces in exclude patterns
 - dir: warn about trailing spaces in exclude patterns

 Warn and then ignore trailing whitespaces in .gitignore files,
 unless they are quoted for fnmatch(3), e.g. "path\ ".

 Will merge to 'next'.


* nd/log-show-linear-break (2014-02-10) 1 commit
 - log: add --show-linear-break to help see non-linear history

 Attempts to show where a single-strand-of-pearls break in "git log"
 output.

 "git log --no-merges --show-linear-break" does not seem to work
 well (tried on range "pu~10..pu" or something like that).


* ss/completion-rec-sub-fetch-push (2014-02-11) 1 commit
 - completion: teach --recurse-submodules to fetch, pull and push

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ks/tree-diff-more (2014-02-24) 15 commits
 - tree-diff: reuse base str(buf) memory on sub-tree recursion
 - tree-diff: no need to call "full" diff_tree_sha1 from show_path()

 - combine-diff: move changed-paths scanning logic into its own function
 - combine-diff: move show_log_first logic/action out of paths scanning
 (this branch is used by ks/tree-diff-nway; uses ks/combine-diff and ks/tree-diff-walk.)

 Code refactoring.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jh/note-trees-record-blobs (2014-02-20) 1 commit
 - notes: disallow reusing non-blob as a note object

 "git notes -C <blob>" should not take an object that is not a blob.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/run-network-tests-by-default (2014-02-14) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-02-25 at 62a8ad0)
 + tests: turn on network daemon tests by default

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2014-02-20

 Teach "make test" to run networking tests when possible by default.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/check-attr-honor-working-tree (2014-02-06) 2 commits
 - check-attr: move to the top of working tree when in non-bare repository
 - t0003: do not chdir the whole test process

 "git check-attr" when (trying to) work on a repository with a
 working tree did not work well when the working tree was specified
 via --work-tree (and obviously with --git-dir).

 The command also works in a bare repository but it reads from the
 (possibly stale, irrelevant and/or nonexistent) index, which may
 need to be fixed to read from HEAD, but that is a completely
 separate issue.  As a related tangentto this separate issue, we may
 want to also fix "check-ignore", which refuses to work in a bare
 repository, to also operate in a bare one.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* nd/http-fetch-shallow-fix (2014-02-13) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-02-25 at ad4e9c9)
 + t5537: move http tests out to t5539
 + fetch-pack: fix deepen shallow over smart http with no-done cap
 + protocol-capabilities.txt: document no-done
 + protocol-capabilities.txt: refer multi_ack_detailed back to pack-protocol.txt
 + pack-protocol.txt: clarify 'obj-id' in the last ACK after 'done'
 + test: rename http fetch and push test files
 + tests: auto-set LIB_HTTPD_PORT from test name
 (this branch is tangled with jk/test-ports.)

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2014-02-13

 Attempting to deepen a shallow repository by fetching over smart
 HTTP transport failed in the protocol exchange, when no-done
 extension was used.  The fetching side waited for the list of
 shallow boundary commits after the sending end stopped talking to
 it.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/makefile (2014-02-05) 16 commits
 - FIXUP
 - move LESS/LV pager environment to Makefile
 - Makefile: teach scripts to include make variables
 - FIXUP
 - Makefile: auto-build C strings from make variables
 - Makefile: drop *_SQ variables
 - FIXUP
 - Makefile: add c-quote helper function
 - Makefile: introduce sq function for shell-quoting
 - Makefile: always create files via make-var
 - Makefile: store GIT-* sentinel files in MAKE/
 - Makefile: prefer printf to echo for GIT-*
 - Makefile: use tempfile/mv strategy for GIT-*
 - Makefile: introduce make-var helper function
 - Makefile: fix git-instaweb dependency on gitweb
 - Makefile: drop USE_GETTEXT_SCHEME from GIT-CFLAGS

 Simplify the Makefile rules and macros that exist primarily for
 quoting purposes, and make it easier to robustly express the
 dependency rules.

 Expecting a reroll.


* ks/tree-diff-walk (2014-02-24) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-02-25 at 17e594f)
 + tree-walk: finally switch over tree descriptors to contain a pre-parsed entry
 + revision: convert to using diff_tree_sha1()
 + line-log: convert to using diff_tree_sha1()

 - log --remerge-diff: show what the conflict resolution changed
 - merge-recursive: allow storing conflict hunks in index
 - Fold all merge diff variants into an enum
 - combine-diff: do not pass revs->dense_combined_merges redundantly
 - log: add a merge base inspection option

 (this branch uses tr/merge-recursive-index-only.)

 "log -p" output learns a new way to let users inspect a merge
 commit by showing the differences between the automerged result
 with conflicts the person who recorded the merge would have seen
 and the final conflict resolution that was recorded in the merge.

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2014-02-06

 All subcommands that take pathspecs mishandled an in-tree symbolic
 link when given it as a full path from the root (which arguably is
 a sick way to use pathspecs).  "git ls-files -s $(pwd)/RelNotes" in
 our tree is an easy reproduction recipe.

* bl/blame-full-history (2014-01-14) 1 commit
 - blame: new option --prefer-first to better handle merged cherry-picks

 By disabling the tree-same optimization (which is consistent with
 the default behaviour of "git log"-family of commands), make "git
 blame" sometimes produce different result from the original code.

 Because the "git blame" output can give result for each line from
 only one lineage of the history, however, this can be only useful
 when you are lucky---unlike "--full-history" of "git log"-family,
 where we can show commits from both lineages of histories with an
 equal weight.  See $gmane/240392 for more detailed discussion.

 + test the commit.gpgsign config option

 + commit-tree: add the commit.gpgsign option to sign all commits

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2014-01-03

 Introduce commit.gpgsign configuration variable to force every
 commit to be GPG signed.  The variable cannot be overriden from the
 command line of some of the commands that create commits except for
 "git commit" and "git commit-tree", but I am not convinced that it
 is a good idea to sprinkle support for --no-gpg-sign everywhere,
 which in turn means that this configuration variable may not be
 such a good idea.
