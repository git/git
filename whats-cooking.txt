What's cooking in git.git (Jun 2023, #06; Fri, 23)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and
aren't considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL
to a message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity (of course they can be resubmit when new interests
arise).

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/

 - t4216: test changed path filters with high bit paths
 - gitformat-commit-graph: describe version 2 of BDAT

 The Bloom filter used for path limited history traversal was broken
 on systems whose "char" is unsigned; update the implementation and
 bump the format version to 2.

 Expecting a reroll.

 - cherry-pick: refuse cherry-pick sequence if index is dirty

 "git cherry-pick A" that replays a single commit stopped before
 clobbering local modification, but "git cherry-pick A..B" did not,
 which has been corrected.

 Expecting a reroll.

 keyrings has been rethought.

 Needs review.
