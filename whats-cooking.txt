What's cooking in git.git (Jun 2011, #04; Wed, 22)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.

I ended up tagging 1.7.6-rc3; please test it well. The final expected to
be at around the end of the week.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* ak/gcc46-profile-feedback (2011-06-20) 3 commits
 - Add explanation of the profile feedback build to the README
 - Add profile feedback build to git
 - Add option to disable NORETURN

* sr/transport-helper-fix (2011-06-19) 20 commits
 - transport-helper: implement marks location as capability
 - transport-helper: Use capname for gitdir capability too
 - transport-helper: export is no longer always the last command
 - transport-helper: change import semantics
 - transport-helper: update ref status after push with export
 - transport-helper: use the new done feature where possible
 - transport-helper: check status code of finish_command
 - transport-helper: factor out push_update_refs_status
 - fast-export: support done feature
 - fast-import: introduce 'done' command
 - git-remote-testgit: fix error handling
 - git-remote-testgit: only push for non-local repositories
 - remote-curl: accept empty line as terminator
 - git_remote_helpers: push all refs during a non-local export
 - transport-helper: don't feed bogus refs to export push
 - teach remote-testgit to import non-HEAD refs
 - t5800: document some non-functional parts of remote helpers
 - t5800: use skip_all instead of prereq
 - t5800: factor out some ref tests
 - transport-helper: fix minor leak in push_refs_with_export

At least Patch 10/20 (git-remote-testgit: fix error handling) and Patch
15/20 (transport-helper: use the new done feature where possible) need a
reroll.

* jc/maint-cygwin-trust-executable-bit-default (2011-06-20) 1 commit
 - cygwin: trust executable bit by default

Fix for an ancient regression.

 - config: avoid segfault when parsing command-line config
 - config: die on error in command-line config
 - fix "git -c" parsing of values with equals signs

 (this branch is used by jk/clone-cmdline-config.)

Separated earlier parts of jk/clone-cmdline-config for maint.

* jm/mergetool-pathspec (2011-06-22) 2 commits
 - mergetool: Don't assume paths are unmerged

I think this is a good idea, but it probably needs a re-roll.

 - gitweb: Refactor git_header_html

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

 - Tighten rules for matching server capabilities in server_supports()
 - send-pack: Attempt to retrieve remote status even if pack-objects fails
 - Update technical docs to reflect side-band-64k capability in receive-pack

Would need another round to separate per-pack and per-session limits.
Not urgent. Will not merge before 1.7.6.
