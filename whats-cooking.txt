What's cooking in git.git (Jul 2020, #01; Mon, 6)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'seen' (formerly 'pu'---proposed updates) while commits prefixed
with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

We are about to tag the -rc0 "preview" and enter pre-release freeze
period.  The change to let users name the initial branch that gets
prepared in a newly created repository has now been merged to be
included in the upcoming release.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches of the
repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

 The code to push changes over "dumb" HTTP had a bad interaction
 with the commit reachability code due to incorrect allocation of
 object flag bits, which has been corrected.

  (merged to 'next' on 2020-06-25 at 64f30b8b41)
 + bash-completion: add git-prune into bash completion

 Add "git prune" to the completion (in contrib/), which could be

* js/default-branch-name (2020-06-30) 10 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-07-01 at c38d766581)

 The name of the primary branch in existing repositories, and the
 default name used for the first branch in newly created

 ourselves off of the hardcoded 'master'.

  (merged to 'next' on 2020-07-01 at cf5d18635c)

  (merged to 'next' on 2020-06-25 at b3cb296341)

 By renumbering object flag bits, "struct object" managed to lose
 bloated inter-field padding.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* bw/fail-cloning-into-non-empty (2020-07-06) 1 commit
 - git clone: don't clone into non-empty directory

 "git clone --separate-git-dir=$elsewhere" used to stomp on the
 contents of the existing directory $elsewhere, which has been
 taught to fail when $elsewhere is not an empty directory.

 Expecting a reroll.
 with improved commit log message.

 "git for-each-ref --format=<>" learned %(contents:size).

 Expecting a reroll.
 with clarified semantics and tests with various object types
 cf. <xmqq5zb09v4e.fsf@gitster.c.googlers.com>


* ls/mergetool-meld-auto-merge (2020-07-06) 1 commit
 - Support auto-merge for meld to follow the vim-diff behavior

 The 'meld' backend of the "git mergetool" learned to give the
 underlying 'meld' the '--auto-merge' option, which would help
 reduce the amount of text that requires manual merging.

 Expecting a reroll.
 with final fixes and readability improvements.
 cf. <xmqqzh8c8eda.fsf@gitster.c.googlers.com>


* pb/log-rev-list-doc (2020-07-06) 4 commits
 - rev-list-description.txt: fix Asciidoc syntax
 - git-log.txt: include rev-list-description.txt
 - git-rev-list.txt: move description to separate file
 - git-log.txt: add links to 'rev-list' and 'diff' docs

 "git help log" has been enhanced by sharing more material from the
 documentation for the underlying "git rev-list" command.

 Expecting a reroll.
 with reordering the last one to make it preparatory clean-up.

* rs/line-log-until (2020-07-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-07-06 at 84d6bc67fa)
 + revision: disable min_age optimization with line-log

 "git log -Lx,y:path --before=date" lost track of where the range
 should be because it didn't take the changes made by the youngest
 commits that are omitted from the output into account.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ta/wait-on-aliased-commands-upon-signal (2020-07-06) 2 commits
 - Wait for child on signal death for aliases to externals
 - Wait for child on signal death for aliases to builtins

 When an aliased command, whose output is piped to a pager by git,
 gets killed by a signal, the pager got into a funny state, which
 has been corrected (again).

 Expecting a reroll.
 with improved log messages.
 cf. <20200706211403.GB85133@coredump.intra.peff.net>

 - upload-pack.c: pass 'struct list_objects_filter_options *'
 - upload-pack.c: allow banning certain object filter(s)

 configurable to selectively allow or reject object filtering
 specification used for partial cloning.

 Waiting for reviews.

* vs/completion-with-set-u (2020-07-01) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-07-06 at 72b1eca511)
 + completion: nounset mode fixes

 The command line completion support (in contrib/) used to be
 prepared to work with "set -u" but recent changes got a bit more
 sloppy.  This has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* dr/push-remoteref-fix (2020-04-23) 1 commit
 - remote.c: fix handling of %(push:remoteref)

 The "%(push:remoteref)" placeholder in the "--format=" argument of
 "git format-patch" (and friends) only showed what got explicitly
 configured, not what ref at the receiving end would be updated when
 "git push" was used, as it ignored the default behaviour (e.g. update
 the same ref as the source).

 Expecting a reroll.
 cf. <20200416152145.wp2zeibxmuyas6y6@feanor>

 Rewrite of the remainder of "git bisect" script in C continues.

 Expecting a response to reviews.

* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2018-10-15) 1 commit
 - zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

--------------------------------------------------

* mt/hash-to-hex-thread-safety (2020-06-26) 2 commits
 - hex: make hash_to_hex_algop() and friends thread-safe
 - compat/win32/pthread: add pthread_once()

 hash_to_hex() used a set of rotating static buffers, which was not
 safe to use in a threaded environment.  This has been made safer by
 using thread-local storage.

 Expecting a reroll.

* mf/submodule-summary-with-correct-repository (2020-06-24) 2 commits
 - submodule: use submodule repository when preparing summary
 - revision: use repository from rev_info when parsing commits

 "git diff/show" on a change that involves a submodule used to read
 the information on commits in the submodule from a wrong repository
 and gave a wrong information when the commit-graph is involved.

 Needs tests.


* ra/send-email-in-reply-to-from-command-line-wins (2020-07-01) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-07-06 at 3892a1ab88)
 + send-email: restore --in-reply-to superseding behavior

 "git send-email --in-reply-to=<msg>" did not use the In-Reply-To:
 header with the value given from the command line, and let it be
 overridden by the value on In-Reply-To: header in the messages
 being sent out (if exists).

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ds/commit-graph-bloom-updates (2020-07-01) 10 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-07-06 at 177e6b362e)

 "git rebase -i" learns a bit more options.

 Waiting for a (hopefully final) review.

 - config: add setting to ignore sparsity patterns in some cmds
 - grep: honor sparse checkout patterns
 - config: correctly read worktree configs in submodules
 - t/helper/test-config: facilitate addition of new cli options

 "git grep" has been tweaked to be limited to the sparse checkout
 paths.

 Review needed on 4/6; otherwise looking sane.

 The second one should be dropped, and possibly replaced with a
 patch that moves message normalization from backends to the more
 generic layer.

* js/ci-skip-on-github-workflow (2020-05-02) 1 commit
 . ci: respect the [skip ci] convention in our GitHub workflow "CI/PR"

 Allow contributors to mark a branch/push that it does not have to
 be built via GitHub actions, in a way similar to how Travis lets
 them mark the commits with an embedded "[skip ci]" string.

 Superseded by dd/ci-only-on-selective-branches topic.


* dd/ci-only-on-selective-branches (2020-05-05) 2 commits

 at GitHub via GitHub Actions, only build when branches with known
 and specific names are updated, and also a pull request.
