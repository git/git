What's cooking in git.git (Jan 2016, #04; Wed, 20)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

The tip of 'master' now has second batch of topics merged, some of
which should later be merged to 'maint'.  There are a few topics
that are v2.7.0 regression fixes still cooking outside 'master',
which also need to be merged to 'maint' for the maintenance release.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches of the
repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

[Graduated to "master"]

* dk/reflog-walk-with-non-commit (2016-01-05) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-01-12 at 5f7b10e)
 + reflog-walk: don't segfault on non-commit sha1's in the reflog

 "git reflog" incorrectly assumed that all objects that used to be
 at the tip of a ref must be commits, which caused it to segfault.


* dw/signoff-doc (2016-01-05) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-01-12 at 1b08b48)
 + Expand documentation describing --signoff

 The documentation has been updated to hint the connection between
 the '--signoff' option and DCO.


* ew/for-each-ref-doc (2016-01-05) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-01-12 at e5c4e75)
 + for-each-ref: document `creatordate` and `creator` fields


* ew/send-email-mutt-alias-fix (2016-01-04) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-01-12 at 84d1329)
 + git-send-email: do not double-escape quotes from mutt

 "git send-email" was confused by escaped quotes stored in the alias
 files saved by "mutt", which has been corrected.


* ho/gitweb-squelch-undef-warning (2016-01-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-01-12 at ef4fc5f)
 + gitweb: squelch "uninitialized value" warning

 Asking gitweb for a nonexistent commit left a warning in the server
 log.

 Somebody may want to follow this up with a new test, perhaps?
 IIRC, we do test that no Perl warnings are given to the server log,
 so this should have been caught if our test coverage were good.


* jk/clang-pedantic (2016-01-04) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-01-12 at b5be271)
 + bswap: add NO_UNALIGNED_LOADS define
 + avoid shifting signed integers 31 bits

 A few unportable C construct have been spotted by clang compiler
 and have been fixed.


* jk/pack-revindex (2015-12-21) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-01-12 at 2e39a16)
 + pack-revindex: store entries directly in packed_git
 + pack-revindex: drop hash table

 In-core storage of the reverse index for .pack files (which lets
 you go from a pack offset to an object name) has been streamlined.


* js/fopen-harder (2016-01-11) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-01-12 at c6ef194)
 + Handle more file writes correctly in shared repos
 + commit: allow editing the commit message even in shared repos

 Some codepaths used fopen(3) when opening a fixed path in $GIT_DIR
 (e.g. COMMIT_EDITMSG) that is meant to be left after the command is
 done.  This however did not work well if the repository is set to
 be shared with core.sharedRepository and the umask of the previous
 user is tighter.  They have been made to work better by calling
 unlink(2) and retrying after fopen(3) fails with EPERM.


* mh/notes-allow-reading-treeish (2016-01-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-01-12 at 7aa311f)
 + notes: allow treeish expressions as notes ref

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2015-10-23

 Some "git notes" operations, e.g. "git log --notes=<note>", should
 be able to read notes from any tree-ish that is shaped like a notes
 tree, but the notes infrastructure required that the argument must
 be a ref under refs/notes/.  Loosen it to require a valid ref only
 when the operation would update the notes (in which case we must
 have a place to store the updated notes tree, iow, a ref).


* nd/clear-gitenv-upon-use-of-alias (2015-12-29) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-01-12 at 696b1f5)
 + run-command: don't warn on SIGPIPE deaths
 + git.c: make sure we do not leak GIT_* to alias scripts
 + setup.c: re-fix d95138e (setup: set env $GIT_WORK_TREE when ..
 + git.c: make it clear save_env() is for alias handling only
 + Merge branch 'nd/stop-setenv-work-tree' into nd/clear-gitenv-upon-use-of-alias

 d95138e6 (setup: set env $GIT_WORK_TREE when work tree is set, like
 $GIT_DIR, 2015-06-26) attempted to work around a glitch in alias
 handling by overwriting GIT_WORK_TREE environment variable to
 affect subprocesses when set_git_work_tree() gets called, which
 resulted in a rather unpleasant regression to "clone" and "init".
 Try to address the same issue by always restoring the environment
 and respawning the real underlying command when handling alias.


* nd/dir-exclude-cleanup (2015-12-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-01-12 at e6584c9)
 + dir.c: clean the entire struct in clear_exclude_list()

 The "exclude_list" structure has the usual "alloc, nr" pair of
 fields to be used by ALLOC_GROW(), but clear_exclude_list() forgot
 to reset 'alloc' to 0 when it cleared 'nr' to discard the managed
 array.


* nd/exclusion-regression-fix (2016-01-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-01-12 at 0eb98a5)
 + Revert "dir.c: don't exclude whole dir prematurely if neg pattern may match"

 The ignore mechanism saw a few regressions around untracked file
 listing and sparse checkout selection areas in 2.7.0; the change
 that is responsible for the regression has been reverted.


* nd/ita-cleanup (2015-12-28) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-01-12 at 008a6e3)
 + grep: make it clear i-t-a entries are ignored
 + add and use a convenience macro ce_intent_to_add()
 + blame: remove obsolete comment

 Paths that have been told the index about with "add -N" are not
 quite yet in the index, but a few commands behaved as if they
 already are in a harmful way.


* sg/t6050-failing-editor-test-fix (2016-01-05) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-01-12 at dc08a19)
 + t6050-replace: make failing editor test more robust


* ss/clone-depth-single-doc (2016-01-08) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-01-12 at 16ded8c)
 + docs: clarify that --depth for git-fetch works with newly initialized repos
 + docs: say "commits" in the --depth option wording for git-clone
 + docs: clarify that passing --depth to git-clone implies --single-branch

 Documentation for "git fetch --depth" has been updated for clarity.


* ss/user-manual (2015-12-30) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-01-12 at c7f0328)
 + user-manual: add addition gitweb information
 + user-manual: add section documenting shallow clones
 + glossary: define the term shallow clone
 + user-manual: remove temporary branch entry from todo list

 Drop a few old "todo" items by deciding that the change one of them
 suggests is not such a good idea, and doing the change the other
 one suggested to do.


* tg/grep-no-index-fallback (2016-01-12) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-01-12 at 8960bdd)
 + builtin/grep: add grep.fallbackToNoIndex config
 + t7810: correct --no-index test

 "git grep" by default does not fall back to its "--no-index"
 behaviour outside a directory under Git's control (otherwise the
 user may by mistake end up running a huge recursive search); with a
 new configuration (set in $HOME/.gitconfig--by definition this
 cannot be set in the config file per project), this safety can be
 disabled.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* dg/subtree-rebase-test (2016-01-19) 1 commit
 - contrib/subtree: Add a test for subtree rebase that loses commits

 Reviewed up to v5.
 Will be rerolled.
 ($gmane/284426)


* jk/shortlog (2016-01-19) 7 commits
 - shortlog: don't warn on empty author
 - shortlog: optimize out useless string list
 - shortlog: optimize out useless "<none>" normalization
 - shortlog: optimize "--summary" mode
 - shortlog: replace hand-parsing of author with pretty-printer
 - shortlog: use strbufs to read from stdin
 - shortlog: match both "Author:" and "author" on stdin

 "git shortlog" used to accumulate various pieces of information
 regardless of what was asked to be shown in the final output.  It
 has been optimized by noticing what need not to be collected
 (e.g. there is no need to collect the log messages when showing
 only the number of changes).

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jc/peace-with-crlf (2016-01-15) 12 commits
 - test-sha1-array: read command stream with strbuf_getline()
 - grep: read -f file with strbuf_getline()
 - send-pack: read list of refs with strbuf_getline()
 - column: read lines with strbuf_getline()
 - cat-file: read batch stream with strbuf_getline()
 - transport-helper: read helper response with strbuf_getline()
 - clone/sha1_file: read info/alternates with strbuf_getline()
 - remote.c: read $GIT_DIR/remotes/* with strbuf_getline()
 - ident.c: read /etc/mailname with strbuf_getline()
 - rev-parse: read parseopt spec with strbuf_getline()
 - revision: read --stdin with strbuf_getline()
 - hash-object: read --stdin-paths with strbuf_getline()
 (this branch uses jc/strbuf-getline.)

 Teach codepaths that communicate with users by reading text files
 to be more lenient to editors that write CRLF-terminated lines.
 Note that this is only about communication with Git, like feeding
 list of object names from the standard input instead of from the
 command line, and does not involve files in the working tree.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* dg/subtree-test (2016-01-19) 1 commit
 - contrib/subtree: Make testing easier

 Needs review.
 ($gmane/284277)


* jk/filter-branch-no-index (2016-01-19) 1 commit
 - filter-branch: resolve $commit^{tree} in no-index case

 A recent optimization to filter-branch in v2.7.0 introduced a
 regression when --prune-empty filter is used, which has been
 corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/sanity (2016-01-19) 1 commit
 - test-lib: clarify and tighten SANITY

 The description for SANITY prerequisite the test suite uses has
 been clarified both in the comment and in the implementation.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ls/travis-prove-order (2016-01-19) 1 commit
 - travis-ci: run previously failed tests first, then slowest to fastest

 By persisting runtime statistics of previous "prove" run, execute
 tests that take longer before other ones, to reduce the total
 wallclock time when running with Travis CI.

 Waiting for a reroll.
 ($gmane/284431)


* nd/do-not-move-worktree-manually (2016-01-19) 2 commits
 - worktree: stop supporting moving worktrees manually
 - worktree.c: fix indentation

 "git worktree" had a broken code that attempted to auto-fix
 possible inconsistency that results from end-users moving a
 worktree to different places without telling Git (the original
 repository needs to maintain backpointers to its worktrees, but
 "mv" run by end-users who are not familiar with that fact will
 obviously not adjust them), which actually made things worse
 when triggered.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sb/submodule-init (2016-01-20) 2 commits
 - submodule: port init from shell to C
 - submodule: port resolve_relative_url from shell to C
 (this branch uses sb/submodule-parallel-update.)

 Needs review.
 ($gmane/284419)

* kf/http-proxy-auth-methods (2015-11-04) 3 commits
 . SQUASH???
 . http: use credential API to handle proxy authentication
 . http: allow selection of proxy authentication method

 New http.proxyAuthMethod configuration variable can be used to
 specify what authentication method to use, as a way to work around
 proxies that do not give error response expected by libcurl when
 CURLAUTH_ANY is used.  Also, the codepath for proxy authentication
 has been taught to use credential API to store the authentication
 material in user's keyrings.

 I ejected this from pu for the moment, as it conflicts with the
 pt/http-socks-proxy topic. That is now in master, so it can
 be re-rolled on top.

 Anybody wants to help rerolling this?  Otherwise will discard.


* mg/httpd-tests-update-for-apache-2.4 (2015-04-08) 2 commits
 - t/lib-git-svn: check same httpd module dirs as lib-httpd
 - t/lib-httpd: load mod_unixd

 This is the first two commits in a three-patch series $gmane/266962

 Becoming tired of waiting for a reroll.
 with updated log message ($gmane/268061).
 Will discard.


* jc/diff-b-m (2015-02-23) 5 commits
 . WIPWIP
 . WIP: diff-b-m
 - diffcore-rename: allow easier debugging
 - diffcore-rename.c: add locate_rename_src()
 - diffcore-break: allow debugging

 "git diff -B -M" produced incorrect patch when the postimage of a
 completely rewritten file is similar to the preimage of a removed
 file; such a resulting file must not be expressed as a rename from
 other place.

 The fix in this patch is broken, unfortunately.
 Will discard.

* js/pull-rebase-i (2016-01-13) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-01-20 at a0c5440)
 + completion: add missing branch.*.rebase values
 + remote: handle the config setting branch.*.rebase=interactive
 + pull: allow interactive rebase with --rebase=interactive

 "git pull --rebase" has been extended to allow invoking
 "rebase -i".

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/ok-to-fail-gc-auto-in-rebase (2016-01-13) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-01-20 at c9a8e82)
 + rebase: ignore failures from "gc --auto"

 "git rebase", unlike all other callers of "gc --auto", did not
 ignore the exit code from "gc --auto".

 Will merge to 'master'.


* js/close-packs-before-gc (2016-01-13) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-01-20 at 16cf87b)
 + receive-pack: release pack files before garbage-collecting
 + merge: release pack files before garbage-collecting
 + am: release pack files before garbage-collecting
 + fetch: release pack files before garbage-collecting

 Many codepaths that run "gc --auto" before exiting kept packfiles
 mapped and left the file descriptors to them open, which was not
 friendly to systems that cannot remove files that are open.  They
 now close the packs before doing so.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* js/msys2 (2016-01-15) 9 commits
 - mingw: uglify (a, 0) definitions to shut up warnings
 - mingw: squash another warning about a cast
 - mingw: avoid warnings when casting HANDLEs to int
 - mingw: avoid redefining S_* constants
 - compat/winansi: support compiling with MSys2
 - compat/mingw: support MSys2-based MinGW build
 - nedmalloc: allow compiling with MSys2's compiler
 - config.mak.uname: supporting 64-bit MSys2
 - config.mak.uname: support MSys2

 Beginning of the upstreaming process of Git for Windows effort.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* rp/p4-filetype-change (2016-01-13) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-01-20 at 7b5954b)

 Will merge to 'master'.


* tk/interpret-trailers-in-place (2016-01-14) 2 commits
 - interpret-trailers: add option for in-place editing
 - trailer: allow to write to files other than stdout

 "interpret-trailers" has been taught to optionally update a file in
 place, instead of always writing the result to the standard output.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* js/dirname-basename (2016-01-15) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-01-20 at d198512)
 + t0060: loosen overly strict expectations
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-01-12 at c3c970a)
 + t0060: verify that basename() and dirname() work as expected
 + compat/basename.c: provide a dirname() compatibility function
 + compat/basename: make basename() conform to POSIX
 + Refactor skipping DOS drive prefixes

 dirname() emulation has been added, as Msys2 lacks it.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* wp/sha1-name-negative-match (2016-01-13) 2 commits
 - object name: introduce '^{/!-<negative pattern>}' notation
 - test for '!' handling in rev-parse's named commits

 Introduce "<branch>^{/!-<pattern>}" notation to name a commit
 reachable from <branch> that does not match the given <pattern>.

 A questionable corner case where commit has no message remains.

 Waiting for review.

* ak/format-patch-odir-config (2016-01-13) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-01-20 at 97c699b)
 + format-patch: introduce format.outputDirectory configuration

 Allow "-o <dir>" option to be omitted on the command line of "git
 format-patch" if you always use the same directory in your
 workflow.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/notes-merge-from-anywhere (2016-01-17) 1 commit
 - notes: allow merging from arbitrary references

 "git notes merge" used to limit the source of the merged notes tree
 to somewhere under refs/notes/ hierarchy, which was too limiting
 when inventing a workflow to exchange notes with remote
 repositories using remote-tracking notes trees (located in e.g.
 refs/remote-notes/ or somesuch).

 Will merge to 'next'.


* dt/unpack-compare-entry-optim (2016-01-05) 1 commit

 + checkout,clone: check return value of create_symref
 + create_symref: write reflog while holding lock
 + create_symref: use existing ref-lock code

 The low-level code that is used to create symbolic references has
 been updated to share more code with the code that deals with
 normal references.

 - contrib/subtree: fix "subtree split" skipped-merge bug

 The "split" subcommand of "git subtree" (in contrib/) incorrectly
 skipped merges when it shouldn't, which was corrected.

* rm/subtree-unwrap-tags (2015-11-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-01-20 at 6373d95)
 + contrib/subtree: unwrap tag refs

 "git subtree" (in contrib/) records the tag object name in the
 commit log message when a subtree is added using a tag, without
 peeling it down to the underlying commit.  The tag needs to be
 peeled when "git subtree split" wants to work on the commit, but
 the command forgot to do so.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* sg/sh-require-clean-orphan (2015-11-24) 2 commits
 - sh-setup: make require_clean_work_tree() work on orphan branches
 - Add tests for git-sh-setup's require_clean_work_tree()

 Allow users of git-sh-setup to handle orphan branch state.

 This series takes the conservative route of requiring scripts to opt
 into the looser behavior, at the expense of carrying around a new
 option-flag forever. I'm not sure if we need to do so.

 Needs review.

 Builds on top of the "fetch --recurse-submodules" work to introduce
 parallel downloading into multiple submodules for "submodule update".

 Needs review.

* js/am-3-merge-recursive-direct (2015-10-12) 2 commits
 - am: make a direct call to merge_recursive
 - merge_recursive_options: introduce the "gently" flag

 The merge_recursive_generic() function has been made a bit safer to
 call from inside a process.  "git am -3" was taught to make a direct
 call to the function when falling back to three-way merge.

 Being able to make a direct call would be good in general, but as a
 performance thing, the change needs to be backed up by numbers.

 Needs review.

 I haven't gone through the "gently" change with fine toothed comb;
 I can see that the change avoids calling die(), but I haven't made
 sure that the program states (e.g. what's in the in-core index) are
 adjusted sensibly when it returns to the caller instead of dying,
 or the codepaths that used to die() are free of resource leaks.
 The original code certainly did not care the program states at the
 point of dying exactly because it knew it is going to exit, but now
 they have to care, and they need to be audited.

* jc/rerere-multi (2015-09-14) 7 commits
 - rerere: do use multiple variants
 - t4200: rerere a merge with two identical conflicts
 - rerere: allow multiple variants to exist
 - rerere: delay the recording of preimage
 - rerere: handle leftover rr-cache/$ID directory and postimage files
 - rerere: scan $GIT_DIR/rr-cache/$ID when instantiating a rerere_id
 - rerere: split conflict ID further

 "git rerere" can encounter two or more files with the same conflict
 signature that have to be resolved in different ways, but there was
 no way to record these separate resolutions.

 Needs review.


* jc/merge-drop-old-syntax (2015-04-29) 1 commit
 - merge: drop 'git merge <message> HEAD <commit>' syntax

 Stop supporting "git merge <message> HEAD <commit>" syntax that has
 been deprecated since October 2007.  It has been reported that
 git-gui still uses the deprecated syntax, which needs to be fixed
 before this final step can proceed.
