What's cooking in git.git (Feb 2009, #03; Sat, 07)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones
marked with '.' do not appear in any of the branches, but I am still
holding onto them.

The topics list the commits in reverse chronological order.  The topics
meant to be merged to the maintenance series have "maint-" in their names.

The master branch is at -rc0 now.

Traditionally, rc freeze, especially post -rc1, meant that I stop paying
attention to whatever topic that did not graduate to 'master', and not
queuing further updates to 'next' to encourage people to concentrate on
'master' bugfixes by discouraging them from tinkering the topics that
won't be in the next release.

I do not think that approach has worked well in practice, so let's try
something slightly different.

I'll try to leave 'next' open during this freeze, but the new topics and
topics that hasn't cooked to maturity by -rc1 will not be in 1.6.2.  That
is what a freeze means, so it may not be necessary to say so, but I am
just trying to make it clear.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* jn/gitweb-committag (Fri Feb 6 10:12:41 2009 +0100) 1 commit
 + gitweb: Better regexp for SHA-1 committag match

* js/maint-1.6.0-path-normalize (Sat Feb 7 16:08:31 2009 +0100) 5 commits
 + Remove unused normalize_absolute_path()
 + Test and fix normalize_path_copy()
 + Fix GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES on Windows
 + Move sanitary_path_copy() to path.c and rename it to
   normalize_path_copy()
 + Make test-path-utils more robust against incorrect use

Replaces one from René that was queued earlier.

* js/git-submodule-trailing-slash (Sat Feb 7 14:43:15 2009 +0100) 2 commits
 + submodule: warn about non-submodules
 + Let ls-files strip trailing slashes in submodules' paths

* ms/mailmap (Thu Feb 5 09:06:41 2009 +0100) 4 commits
 - Change current mailmap usage to do matching on both name and email
   of author/committer.
 - Add map_user() and clear_mailmap() to mailmap
 - Add find_insert_index, insert_at_index and clear_func functions to
   string_list
 - Add log.mailmap as configurational option for mailmap location

* ff/submodule-no-fetch (Thu Feb 5 20:18:32 2009 -0200) 1 commit
 - submodule: add --no-fetch parameter to update command

* mc/setup-cd-p (Fri Feb 6 19:24:28 2009 -0800) 1 commit
 - git-sh-setup: Use "cd" option, not /bin/pwd, for symlinked work
   tree

* js/rebase-error-a-bit-more-verbose (Sat Feb 7 18:20:09 2009 +0100) 1 commit
 + rebase: explain why when the HEAD could not be detached

All of these looked sensible, and I think many deserve to be in 1.6.2.
They are not in -rc0 only because I started the release engineering before
they arrived.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Stalled and may need help and prodding to go forward]

* jc/blame (Wed Jun 4 22:58:40 2008 -0700) 2 commits
 + blame: show "previous" information in --porcelain/--incremental
   format
 + git-blame: refactor code to emit "porcelain format" output

This gives Porcelains (like gitweb) the information on the commit _before_
the one that the final blame is laid on, which should save them one
rev-parse to dig further.  The line number in the "previous" information
may need refining, and sanity checking code for reference counting may
need to be resurrected before this can move forward.

Recent tig discussion may blow new life into it.  Let's see.

* db/foreign-scm (Sun Jan 11 15:12:10 2009 -0500) 3 commits
 - Support fetching from foreign VCSes
 - Add specification of git-vcs helpers
 - Add "vcs" config option in remotes

The "spec" did not seem quite well cooked yet, but in the longer term I
think something like this to allow interoperating with other SCMs as if
the other end is a native git repository is a very worthy goal.

* cc/replace (Mon Feb 2 06:13:06 2009 +0100) 11 commits
 - builtin-replace: use "usage_msg_opt" to give better error messages
 - parse-options: add new function "usage_msg_opt"
 - builtin-replace: teach "git replace" to actually replace
 - Add new "git replace" command
 - environment: add global variable to disable replacement
 - mktag: call "check_sha1_signature" with the replacement sha1
 - replace_object: add a test case
 - object: call "check_sha1_signature" with the replacement sha1
 - sha1_file: add a "read_sha1_file_repl" function
 - replace_object: add mechanism to replace objects found in
   "refs/replace/"
 - refs: add a "for_each_replace_ref" function

I think the code is much cleaner than the first round, but I am not
convinced it is doing the right thing in the connectivity traverser.  
I'd like to keep this out of 1.6.2.

* sc/gitweb-category (Fri Dec 12 00:45:12 2008 +0100) 3 commits
 - gitweb: Optional grouping of projects by category
 - gitweb: Split git_project_list_body in two functions
 - gitweb: Modularized git_get_project_description to be more generic

Design discussion between Jakub and Sebastien seems to have stalled.

* jc/fsck (Fri Jan 30 02:33:47 2009 -0800) 4 commits
 - fsck: three levels of validation
 - verify-pack: add --quick
 - verify_pack(): allow a quicker verification for a pack with
   version 2 idx
 - pack-check.c: minor formatting fix to match coding style

J6t has a good point that if this had any value then medium level should
replace the default.  I am tempted to actually dropping this as a failed
experiment.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Reverted]

* mh/unify-color (Fri Jan 23 01:25:23 2009 -0800) 3 commits
 ? Revert previous two commits
 ? move the color variables to color.c
 ? handle color.ui at a central place

This broke git-format-patch badly.

* rs/maint-1.6.0-windows-ceiling (Sat Feb 7 12:40:40 2009 -0800) 2 commits
 ? Revert "fix t1504 on Windows"
 ? fix t1504 on Windows

I'm giving a fresh start to J6t's series which contains this.

* lh/reverted-submodule-tree-traversal (Sun Jan 25 18:39:55 2009 -0800) 4 commits
 ? Revert round #1 of the series
 ? builtin-ls-tree: enable traversal of submodules
 ? archive.c: enable traversal of submodules
 ? tree.c: add support for traversal of submodules

I'm giving a fresh start to Lars's second iteration.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Actively cooking]

* lh/submodule-tree-traversal (Sun Jan 25 01:52:06 2009 +0100) 2 commits
 - archive.c: add support for --submodules[=(all|checkedout)]
 + tree.c: allow read_tree_recursive() to traverse gitlink entries

I think the first one is Ok to have in 1.6.2 but I didn't audit all the
r-t-r callback functions myself to make sure they do not return
READ_TREE_RECURSIVE when they shouldn't.  Perhaps somebody else should
double check.

* kb/checkout-optim (Wed Feb 4 13:53:20 2009 +0100) 8 commits
 - lstat_cache(): print a warning if doing ping-pong between cache
   types
 - show_patch_diff(): remove a call to fstat()
 - write_entry(): cleanup of some duplicated code
 - create_directories(): remove some memcpy() and strchr() calls
 - unlink_entry(): introduce schedule_dir_for_removal()
 - lstat_cache(): swap func(length, string) into func(string, length)
 - lstat_cache(): generalise longest_match_lstat_cache()
 - lstat_cache(): small cleanup and optimisation

I thought it looked fine, but Kjetil asks to cook this a bit longer.

* js/valgrind (Thu Feb 5 22:03:00 2009 +0100) 9 commits
 + valgrind: do not require valgrind 3.4.0 or newer
 + test-lib: avoid assuming that templates/ are in the GIT_EXEC_PATH
 + Tests: let --valgrind imply --verbose and --tee
 + Add a script to coalesce the valgrind outputs
 + t/Makefile: provide a 'valgrind' target
 + test-lib.sh: optionally output to test-results/$TEST.out, too
 + Valgrind support: check for more than just programming errors
 + valgrind: ignore ldso and more libz errors
 + Add valgrind support in test scripts

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* js/maint-remote-remove-mirror (Wed Feb 4 11:06:07 2009 -0500) 2 commits
 + builtin-remote: make rm operation safer in mirrored repository
 + builtin-remote: make rm() use properly named variable to hold
   return value

* ek/maint-filter-branch-bare (Tue Feb 3 13:27:03 2009 -0500) 1 commit
 + filter-branch: Fix fatal error on bare repositories

* tr/add-p-single (Fri Feb 6 20:30:01 2009 +0100) 3 commits
 + add -p: import Term::ReadKey with 'require'
 + add -p: print errors in separate color
 + add -p: prompt for single characters

* js/notes (Tue Jan 13 20:57:16 2009 +0100) 6 commits
 + git-notes: fix printing of multi-line notes
 + notes: fix core.notesRef documentation
 + Add an expensive test for git-notes
 + Speed up git notes lookup
 + Add a script to edit/inspect notes
 + Introduce commit notes

* gt/utf8-width (Fri Jan 30 04:41:29 2009 -0500) 2 commits
 + builtin-blame.c: Use utf8_strwidth for author's names
 + utf8: add utf8_strwidth()

I replaced the bottom one with a cheesy "if it does not look like
utf8, give strlen back" to make the result behave sensibly for legacy
encodings.  It does improve "git blame git-stash.sh" output (especially
if you remove .mailmap).

* jk/head-symref (Thu Jan 29 03:33:02 2009 -0500) 2 commits
 + symbolic ref: refuse non-ref targets in HEAD
 + validate_headref: tighten ref-matching to just branches

* rc/http-push (Tue Feb 3 20:39:00 2009 +0800) 4 commits
 + http-push: wrap signature of get_remote_object_url
 + http-push: add back underscore separator before lock token
 + http-push.c: get_remote_object_url() is only used under
   USE_CURL_MULTI
 + http-push: refactor request url creation

* jc/refuse-push-to-current (Sat Jan 31 17:34:05 2009 -0800) 1 commit
 + receive-pack: explain what to do when push updates the current
   branch

* cb/mergetool (Fri Jan 30 23:20:11 2009 +0000) 3 commits
 + mergetool: fix running mergetool in sub-directories
 + mergetool: Add a test for running mergetool in a sub-directory
 + mergetool: respect autocrlf by using checkout-index

----------------------------------------------------------------
[On Hold]

* jc/refuse-push-to-current-1.7.0 (Sat Jan 31 17:34:05 2009 -0800) 1 commit
 - Refuse updating the current branch in a non-bare repository via
   push

This is for 1.7.0.

* jc/commit-assume-also-during-merge (Thu Jan 22 22:21:49 2009 -0800) 3 commits
 - git commit: pathspec without -i/-o implies -i semantics during a
   merge
 - builtin-commit: shorten eye-sore overlong lines
 - Add "partial commit" tests during a conflicted merge

This is only meant as a weatherballoon to help facilitate discussion.

* jc/merge-convert (Mon Jan 26 16:45:01 2009 -0800) 1 commit
 - git-merge-file: allow converting the results for the work tree

This is a feature waiting for a user.  I do not need it in 1.6.2

We did not give scripted Porcelains a way to say "this temporary file I am
using for merging is for this path, so use the core.autocrlf and attributes
rules for that final path".  Instead, merge-file simply wrote out the
data in the canonical repository representation.

rerere has the same issue, but it is a lot worse.  It reads the three
files (preimage, postimage and thisimage) from the work tree in the work
tree representation, merges them without converting them to the canonical
representation first but inserts the conflict markers with the canonical
representation and writes the resulting mess out.  It needs to be fixed to
read with convert_to_git(), merge them while they are still in the
canonical representation and possibly add conflict markers, and then write
the results out after convert_to_working_tree().  It also needs to write
in binary mode as well.

 . diff: enable "too large a rename" warning when -M/-C is explicitly
   asked for

 . stripspace: add --log-clean option to clean up signed-off-by:
   lines
 . stripspace: use parse_options()
 . Add "git am -s" test
 . git-am: refactor code to add signed-off-by line for the committer
