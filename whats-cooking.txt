What's cooking in git.git (Oct 2021, #03; Mon, 11)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen',
which means nothing more than that I have found them of interest for
some reason (like "it may have hard-to-resolve conflicts with
another topic already in flight" or "this may turn out to be
useful").  Do not read too much into a topic being in (or not in)
'seen'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of the
integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

The eleventh and twelfth batches of topics are in the 'master'
branch, and quite a many topics started cooking in 'next'.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

* jk/cat-file-batch-all-wo-replace (2021-10-08) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-10-11 at 9415f7c43a)
 + cat-file: use packed_object_info() for --batch-all-objects
 + cat-file: split ordered/unordered batch-all-objects callbacks
 + cat-file: disable refs/replace with --batch-all-objects
 + cat-file: mention --unordered along with --batch-all-objects
 + t1006: clean up broken objects

 "git cat-file --batch" with the "--batch-all-objects" option is
 supposed to iterate over all the objects found in a repository, but
 it used to translate these object names using the replace mechanism,
 which defeats the point of enumerating all objects in the repository.
 This has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.

* mp/absorb-submodule-git-dir-upon-deinit (2021-10-07) 1 commit
 - submodule: absorb git dir instead of dying on deinit

 "git submodule deinit" for a submodule whose .git metadata
 directory is embedded in its working tree refused to work, until
 the submodule gets converted to use the "absorbed" form where the
 metadata directory is stored in superproject, and a gitfile at the
 top-level of the working tree of the submodule points at it.  The
 command is taught to convert such submodules to the absorbed form
 as needed.

 Under review.

* ns/remerge-diff (2021-10-08) 8 commits
 - doc/diff-options: explain the new --remerge-diff option

 - ll-merge: add API for capturing warnings in a strbuf instead of stderr
 - merge-ort: add ability to record conflict messages in a file
 - merge-ort: mark a few more conflict messages as omittable
 - Merge branch 'ns/tmp-objdir' into ns/remerge-diff
 (this branch uses ns/tmp-objdir.)

 A new presentation for two-parent merge "--remerge-diff" can be
 used to show the difference between mechanical (and possibly
 conflicted) merge results and the recorded resolution.

 On hold.
 This is Elijah's remerge-diff rebased on ns/tmp-objdir to share the
 "create objects temporarily, only to discard without committing
 them to longer-term storage" infrastructure with another topic.


* ns/tmp-objdir (2021-10-04) 2 commits
 - tmp-objdir: disable ref updates when replacing the primary odb
 - tmp-objdir: new API for creating temporary writable databases
 (this branch is used by ns/batched-fsync and ns/remerge-diff.)

 New interface into the tmp-objdir API to help in-core use of the
 quarantine feature.

* pw/sparse-cache-tree-verify-fix (2021-10-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-10-11 at 2f90c87850)
 + sparse index: fix use-after-free bug in cache_tree_verify()

 Recent sparse-index addition, namely any use of index_name_pos(),
 can expand sparse index entries and breaks any code that walks
 cache-tree or existing index entries.  One such instance of such a
 breakage has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* rs/make-verify-path-really-verify-again (2021-10-07) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-10-11 at 6b4358876f)
 + read-cache: let verify_path() reject trailing dir separators again
 + read-cache: add verify_path_internal()
 + t3905: show failure to ignore sub-repo

 Recent sparse-index work broke safety against attempts to add paths
 with trailing slashes to the index, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 - reset: expand test coverage for sparse checkouts
 - update-index: add --force-full-index option for expand/collapse test

 - reset: rename is_missing to !is_in_reset_tree

 Various operating modes of "git reset" have been made to work
 better with the sparse index.

  (merged to 'next' on 2021-10-06 at 1950944b8c)

 "git grep --recurse-submodules" takes trees and blobs from the
