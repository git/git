What's cooking in git.git (Jun 2022, #03; Fri, 10)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen',
and aren't considered "accepted" at all.

This cycle will complete at around the end of June
(https://tinyurl.com/gitCal); -rc0 and -rc1 are scheduled to happen
next week.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

Release tarballs are available at:

 - branch: check for bisects and rebases
 - branch: add branch_checked_out() helper

 Introduce a helper to see if a branch is already being worked on
 (hence should not be newly checked out in a working tree), which
 performs much better than the existing find_shared_symref() to
 replace many uses of the latter.

 We may find an object missing after a "git fetch" stores the

 because the remote failed to send necessary objects.  Reword the

 user a safe one to access; it now also considers a repository owned
 by root a safe one, too (after all, if an attacker can craft a
 malicious repository owned by root, the box is 0wned already).

* gg/worktree-from-the-above (2022-05-20) 3 commits
 - dir: minor refactoring / clean-up
 - dir: cache git_dir's realpath
 - dir: traverse into repository

 With a non-bare repository, with core.worktree pointing at a
 directory that has the repository as its subdirectory, regressed in
 Git 2.27 days.

 Needs review.

* ar/send-email-confirm-by-default (2022-04-22) 1 commit
 - send-email: always confirm by default

 "git send-email" is changed so that by default it asks for
 confirmation before sending each message out.

 Will discard.

 I wanted to like this, and had it in the version of Git I use
 myself for daily work, but the prompting turned out to be somewhat
 distracting.

 Thoughts?

* ds/rebase-update-refs (2022-06-07) 7 commits
 . rebase: add rebase.updateRefs config option
 . sequencer: implement 'update-refs' command
 . rebase: add --update-refs option
 . sequencer: add update-refs command
 . sequencer: define array with enum values
 . branch: add branch_checked_out() helper
 . log-tree: create for_each_decoration()

 "git rebase" learns "--update-refs" to update the refs that point
 at commits being rewritten so that they point at the corresponding
 commits in the rewritten history.

 Retracted for possible future redesign.
