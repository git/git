What's cooking in git.git (Apr 2022, #07; Thu, 28)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen',
and aren't considered "accepted" at all.

The 2.36 release unfortunately turned out to be a release with
unusually high number of regressions.  We have dealt with a few of
them on the 'master' front already, and there are a few more whose
fixes have not been adequately reviewed or agreed upon.

 - hooks no longer is connected directly to the standard output.
   cf. <CA+dzEBn108QoMA28f0nC8K21XT+Afua0V2Qv8XkR8rAeqUCCZw@mail.gmail.com>

 - "sudo make install" does not work out-of-the-box.
   cf. <4ef9287b-6260-9538-7c89-cffb611520ee@maurel.de>

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/

* gc/submodule-update-part2 (2022-04-26) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2022-04-26 at 673a597451)
 + submodule--helper: fix initialization of warn_if_uninitialized

 "git submodule update" without pathspec should silently skip an
 uninitialized submodule, but it started to become noisy by mistake.

 This fixes a regression in 2.36 and is slate to go to 2.36.1

* jc/diff-tree-stdin-fix (2022-04-26) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2022-04-26 at acf23a19ac)
 + 2.36 gitk/diff-tree --stdin regression fix

 "diff-tree --stdin" has been broken for about a year, but 2.36
 release broke it even worse by breaking running the command with
 <pathspec>, which in turn broke "gitk" and got noticed.  This has
 been corrected by aligning its behaviour to that of "log".

 This fixes a regression in 2.36 and is slate to go to 2.36.1

 Regression fix for 2.36 where "git name-rev" started to sometimes
 reference strings after they are freed.

 This fixes a regression in 2.36 and is slate to go to 2.36.1

* ab/hooks-regression-fix (2022-04-21) 6 commits
 - hook API: fix v2.36.0 regression: hooks should be connected to a TTY
 - hook API: don't redundantly re-set "no_stdin" and "stdout_to_stderr"
 - hook tests: fix redirection logic error in 96e7225b310
 - run-command: add an "ungroup" option to run_process_parallel()
 - run-command tests: test stdout of run_command_parallel()
 - run-command API: replace run_processes_parallel_tr2() with opts struct

 In Git 2.36 we revamped the way how hooks are invoked.  One change
 that is end-user visible is that the output of a hook is no longer
 directly connected to the standard output of "git" that spawns the
 hook, which was noticed post release.  This is getting corrected.
