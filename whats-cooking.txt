What's cooking in git.git (Apr 2023, #08; Thu, 27)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a future
release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and aren't
considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL to a
message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity.

A set of new maintenance releases to address some security issues
have been made; all the integration tracks also have the same fixes.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

 - negotiator/skipping: fix some problems in mark_common()

 The implementation of the default "negotiator", used to find common
 ancestor over the network for object tranfer, used to be recursive;
 it was updated to be iterative to conserve stackspace usage.

 GIT_DEFAULT_HASH and "git clone", which has been clarified to
 stress that the variable is to be ignored by the command.

* mh/fix-detect-compilers-with-nondigit-versions (2023-04-26) 1 commit
 - Handle some compiler versions containing a dash

 The detect-compilers script to help auto-tweaking the build system
 had trouble working with compilers whose version number has extra
 suffixes.  The script has been taught that certain suffixes (like
 "-win32" in "gcc 10-win32") can be safely stripped as they share
 the same features and bugs with the version without the suffix.

 setting pull.rebase=true, but these days pull.rebase=merges may be
 more inline with the original spirit of "rebuild your side on top
 of theirs".

 "cat-file" in the batch mode that is fed NUL-terminated pathnames
 learned to cquote them in its error output (otherwise, a funny
 pathname with LF in it would break the lines in the output stream).

 of cruft packs has been made the default and no longer considered
 an experimental feature.

 - usage: clarify --recurse-submodules as a boolean

 The "--[no-]recurse-submodules" option of "git checkout" and others
 supported an undocumented syntax --recurse-submodules=<value> where
 the value can spell a Boolean in various ways.  The support for the
 syntax is being dropped.

 Expecting a reroll.
