What's cooking in git.git (Aug 2010, #05; Sat, 21)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones
marked with '.' do not appear in any of the integration branches, but I am
still holding onto them.

I fixed up a trivial error in the configuration parser (which didn't
return immediately after parsing), and while at it flipped the default 
value of the configuration and the command line option to false.

This probably needs tests; also we know of longstanding bugs in related
area that needs to be addressed---they do not have to be part of this
series but their reproduction recipe would belong to the test script for
this topic.

Previously many individual topic branches from the same author, all
regarding tests.  I thought it probably was ready for 'next' but was
holding off as we seem to still keep getting many fixes on top.
