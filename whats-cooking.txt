What's cooking in git.git (Oct 2016, #02; Thu, 6)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

With fixes since 2.10 accumulated on the 'master' front, the first
maintenance release 2.10.1 has been tagged.  The auto-abbreviation
by Linus and Peff is now in 'next'.  The tip of 'master' has quite a
many topics merged since the last report.  Pat is back and hopefully
be more active as the git-gui maintainer.  Life is good ;-)

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* jc/blame-abbrev (2016-09-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-10-03 at 8ec86ff1e1)
 + blame: use DEFAULT_ABBREV macro

 Almost everybody uses DEFAULT_ABBREV to refer to the default
 setting for the abbreviation, but "git blame" peeked into
 underlying variable bypassing the macro for no good reason.


* jk/ambiguous-short-object-names (2016-09-27) 11 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-09-28 at 1b85295323)
 + get_short_sha1: make default disambiguation configurable
 + get_short_sha1: list ambiguous objects on error
 + for_each_abbrev: drop duplicate objects
 + sha1_array: let callbacks interrupt iteration
 + get_short_sha1: mark ambiguity error for translation
 + get_short_sha1: NUL-terminate hex prefix
 + get_short_sha1: refactor init of disambiguation code
 + get_short_sha1: parse tags when looking for treeish
 + get_sha1: propagate flags to child functions
 + get_sha1: avoid repeating ourselves via ONLY_TO_DIE
 + get_sha1: detect buggy calls with multiple disambiguators
 (this branch is used by jk/abbrev-auto and lt/abbrev-auto.)

 When given an abbreviated object name that is not (or more
 realistically, "no longer") unique, we gave a fatal error
 "ambiguous argument".  This error is now accompanied by hints that
 lists the objects that begins with the given prefix.  During the
 course of development of this new feature, numerous minor bugs were
 uncovered and corrected, the most notable one of which is that we
 gave "short SHA1 xxxx is ambiguous." twice without good reason.


* jk/graph-padding-fix (2016-09-29) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-10-03 at 3f526e0f38)
 + graph: fix extra spaces in graph_padding_line

 The "graph" API used in "git log --graph" miscounted the number of
 output columns consumed so far when drawing a padding line, which
 has been fixed; this did not affect any existing code as nobody
 tried to write anything after the padding on such a line, though.


* ps/http-gssapi-cred-delegation (2016-09-29) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-10-03 at 310fbe8f24)
 + http: control GSSAPI credential delegation

 In recent versions of cURL, GSSAPI credential delegation is
 disabled by default due to CVE-2011-2192; introduce a configuration
 to selectively allow enabling this.


* rs/c-auto-resets-attributes (2016-09-29) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-10-03 at 6a0b946a79)
 + pretty: avoid adding reset for %C(auto) if output is empty

 When "%C(auto)" appears at the very beginning of the pretty format
 string, it did not need to issue the reset sequence, but it did.
 This is a small optimization to already graduated topic.


* rs/cocci (2016-10-03) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-10-03 at 758cc6de9c)
 + coccicheck: make transformation for strbuf_addf(sb, "...") more precise
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-09-28 at 26462645f9)
 + use strbuf_add_unique_abbrev() for adding short hashes, part 2
 + use strbuf_addstr() instead of strbuf_addf() with "%s", part 2
 + gitignore: ignore output files of coccicheck make target

 Code clean-up with help from coccinelle tool continues.


* sg/ref-filter-parse-optim (2016-10-03) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-10-03 at 9af6bb63e9)
 + ref-filter: strip format option after a field name only once while parsing

 The code that parses the format parameter of for-each-ref command
 has seen a micro-optimization.


* vn/revision-shorthand-for-side-branch-log (2016-09-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-09-28 at c1237b24f6)
 + revision: new rev^-n shorthand for rev^n..rev

 "git log rev^..rev" is an often-used revision range specification
 to show what was done on a side branch merged at rev.  This has
 gained a short-hand "rev^-1".  In general "rev^-$n" is the same as
 "^rev^$n rev", i.e. what has happened on other branches while the
 history leading to nth parent was looking the other way.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* jc/ws-error-highlight (2016-10-04) 4 commits
 - diff: introduce diff.wsErrorHighlight option
 - diff.c: move ws-error-highlight parsing helpers up
 - diff.c: refactor parse_ws_error_highlight()
 - t4015: split out the "setup" part of ws-error-highlight test

 "git diff/log --ws-error-highlight=<kind>" lacked the corresponding
 configuration variable to set it by default.

 Undecided.


* jk/abbrev-auto (2016-10-03) 1 commit
 - find_unique_abbrev: move logic out of get_short_sha1()
 (this branch uses lt/abbrev-auto.)

 Updates the way approximate count of total objects is computed
 while attempting to come up with a unique abbreviated object name,
 which in turn needs to estimate how many hexdigits are necessary to
 ensure uniqueness.

 Undecided.


* jk/clone-copy-alternates-fix (2016-10-05) 1 commit
 - clone: detect errors in normalize_path_copy

 "git clone" of a local repository can be done at the filesystem
 level, but the codepath did not check errors while copying and
 adjusting the file that lists alternate object stores.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* nd/commit-p-doc (2016-10-05) 1 commit
 - git-commit.txt: clarify --patch mode with pathspec

 Documentation for "git commit" was updated to clarify that "commit
 -p <paths>" adds to the current contents of the index to come up
 with what to commit.

 Will merge to 'next'.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* jc/bundle (2016-03-03) 6 commits
 - index-pack: --clone-bundle option
 - Merge branch 'jc/index-pack' into jc/bundle
 - bundle v3: the beginning
 - bundle: keep a copy of bundle file name in the in-core bundle header
 - bundle: plug resource leak
 - bundle doc: 'verify' is not about verifying the bundle

 The beginning of "split bundle", which could be one of the
 ingredients to allow "git clone" traffic off of the core server
 network to CDN.

 While I think it would make it easier for people to experiment and
 build on if the topic is merged to 'next', I am at the same time a
 bit reluctant to merge an unproven new topic that introduces a new
 file format, which we may end up having to support til the end of
 time.  It is likely that to support a "prime clone from CDN", it
 would need a lot more than just "these are the heads and the pack
 data is over there", so this may not be sufficient.

 Will discard.


* jc/attr (2016-05-25) 18 commits
 - attr: support quoting pathname patterns in C style
 - attr: expose validity check for attribute names
 - attr: add counted string version of git_attr()
 - attr: add counted string version of git_check_attr()
 - attr: retire git_check_attrs() API
 - attr: convert git_check_attrs() callers to use the new API
 - attr: convert git_all_attrs() to use "struct git_attr_check"
 - attr: (re)introduce git_check_attr() and struct git_attr_check
 - attr: rename function and struct related to checking attributes
 - attr.c: plug small leak in parse_attr_line()
 - attr.c: tighten constness around "git_attr" structure
 - attr.c: simplify macroexpand_one()
 - attr.c: mark where #if DEBUG ends more clearly
 - attr.c: complete a sentence in a comment
 - attr.c: explain the lack of attr-name syntax check in parse_attr()
 - attr.c: update a stale comment on "struct match_attr"
 - attr.c: use strchrnul() to scan for one line
 - commit.c: use strchrnul() to scan for one line
 (this branch is used by jc/attr-more, sb/pathspec-label and sb/submodule-default-paths.)

 The attributes API has been updated so that it can later be
 optimized using the knowledge of which attributes are queried.

 I wanted to polish this topic further to make the attribute
 subsystem thread-ready, but because other topics depend on this
 topic and they do not (yet) need it to be thread-ready.

 As the authors of topics that depend on this seem not in a hurry,
 let's discard this and dependent topics and restart them some other
 day.

 Will discard.


* jc/attr-more (2016-06-09) 8 commits
 - attr.c: outline the future plans by heavily commenting
 - attr.c: always pass check[] to collect_some_attrs()
 - attr.c: introduce empty_attr_check_elems()
 - attr.c: correct ugly hack for git_all_attrs()
 - attr.c: rename a local variable check
 - fixup! d5ad6c13
 - attr.c: pass struct git_attr_check down the callchain
 - attr.c: add push_stack() helper
 (this branch uses jc/attr; is tangled with sb/pathspec-label and sb/submodule-default-paths.)

 The beginning of long and tortuous journey to clean-up attribute
 subsystem implementation.

 Needs to be redone.
 Will discard.


* sb/submodule-default-paths (2016-06-20) 5 commits
 - completion: clone can recurse into submodules
 - clone: add --init-submodule=<pathspec> switch
 - submodule update: add `--init-default-path` switch
 - Merge branch 'sb/pathspec-label' into sb/submodule-default-paths
 - Merge branch 'jc/attr' into sb/submodule-default-paths
 (this branch uses jc/attr and sb/pathspec-label; is tangled with jc/attr-more.)

 Allow specifying the set of submodules the user is interested in on
 the command line of "git clone" that clones the superproject.

 Will discard.


* sb/pathspec-label (2016-06-03) 6 commits
 - pathspec: disable preload-index when attribute pathspec magic is in use
 - pathspec: allow escaped query values
 - pathspec: allow querying for attributes
 - pathspec: move prefix check out of the inner loop
 - pathspec: move long magic parsing out of prefix_pathspec
 - Documentation: fix a typo
 (this branch is used by sb/submodule-default-paths; uses jc/attr; is tangled with jc/attr-more.)

 The pathspec mechanism learned ":(attr:X)$pattern" pathspec magic
 to limit paths that match $pattern further by attribute settings.
 The preload-index mechanism is disabled when the new pathspec magic
 is in use (at least for now), because the attribute subsystem is
 not thread-ready.

 Will discard.


* mh/connect (2016-06-06) 10 commits
 - connect: [host:port] is legacy for ssh
 - connect: move ssh command line preparation to a separate function
 - connect: actively reject git:// urls with a user part
 - connect: change the --diag-url output to separate user and host
 - connect: make parse_connect_url() return the user part of the url as a separate value
 - connect: group CONNECT_DIAG_URL handling code
 - connect: make parse_connect_url() return separated host and port
 - connect: re-derive a host:port string from the separate host and port variables
 - connect: call get_host_and_port() earlier
 - connect: document why we sometimes call get_port after get_host_and_port

 Rewrite Git-URL parsing routine (hopefully) without changing any
 behaviour.

 It has been two months without any support.  We may want to discard
 this.

 GSoC "bisect" topic.

 I'd prefer to see early part solidified so that reviews can focus
 on the later part that is still in flux.  We are almost there but
 not quite yet.


* kn/ref-filter-branch-list (2016-05-17) 17 commits
 - branch: implement '--format' option

 - ref-filter: include reference to 'used_atom' within 'atom_value'
 - ref-filter: implement %(if), %(then), and %(else) atoms

 The code to list branches in "git branch" has been consolidated
 with the more generic ref-filter API.

 Rerolled.
 Needs review.

 Was expecting a reroll, but now pb/bisect topic starts removinging
 more and more parts from git-bisect.sh, this needs to see a fresh
 reroll.

 Will discard.

* ec/annotate-deleted (2015-11-20) 1 commit
 - annotate: skip checking working tree if a revision is provided

 Usability fix for annotate-specific "<file> <rev>" syntax with deleted
 files.

 Has been waiting for a review for too long without seeing anything.

 Will discard.


* dk/gc-more-wo-pack (2016-01-13) 4 commits
 - gc: clean garbage .bitmap files from pack dir
 - t5304: ensure non-garbage files are not deleted
 - t5304: test .bitmap garbage files

* jc/diff-b-m (2015-02-23) 5 commits
 . WIPWIP
 . WIP: diff-b-m
 - diffcore-rename: allow easier debugging
 - diffcore-rename.c: add locate_rename_src()
 - diffcore-break: allow debugging

 "git diff -B -M" produced incorrect patch when the postimage of a
 completely rewritten file is similar to the preimage of a removed
 file; such a resulting file must not be expressed as a rename from
 other place.

 The fix in this patch is broken, unfortunately.

 Will discard.

* nd/ita-empty-commit (2016-09-28) 3 commits
 - commit: don't be fooled by ita entries when creating initial commit
 - diff-lib.c: enable --shift-ita in index_differs_from()
 - Resurrect "diff-lib.c: adjust position of i-t-a entries in diff"

 When new paths were added by "git add -N" to the index, it was
 enough to circumvent the check by "git commit" to refrain from
 making an empty commit without "--allow-empty".  The same logic
 prevented "git status" to show such a path as "new file" in the
 "Changes not staged for commit" section.

 Expecting a reroll.

* lt/abbrev-auto (2016-10-03) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-10-03 at bb188d00f7)
 + abbrev: auto size the default abbreviation
 + abbrev: prepare for new world order
 + abbrev: add FALLBACK_DEFAULT_ABBREV to prepare for auto sizing
 (this branch is used by jk/abbrev-auto.)

 Allow the default abbreviation length, which has historically been
 7, to scale as the repository grows.  The logic suggests to use 12
 hexdigits for the Linux kernel, and 9 to 10 for Git itself.

 Will hold to see if people scream.


* dt/http-empty-auth (2016-10-04) 1 commit
 - http: http.emptyauth should allow empty (not just NULL) usernames

 http.emptyauth configuration is a way to allow an empty username to
 pass when attempting to authenticate using mechanisms like
 Kerberos.  We took an unspecified (NULL) username and sent ":"
 (i.e. no username, no password) to CURLOPT_USERPWD, but did not do
 the same when the username is explicitly set to an empty string.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jc/diff-unique-abbrev-comments (2016-09-30) 1 commit
 - diff_unique_abbrev(): document its assumption and limitation


* jk/quarantine-received-objects (2016-10-05) 5 commits
 - tmp-objdir: do not migrate files starting with '.'
 - tmp-objdir: put quarantine information in the environment
 - receive-pack: quarantine objects until pre-receive accepts
 - tmp-objdir: introduce API for temporary object directories
 - check_connected: accept an env argument
 (this branch uses jk/alt-odb-cleanup.)

 In order for the receiving end of "git push" to inspect the
 received history and decide to reject the push, the objects sent
 from the sending end need to be made available to the hook and
 the mechanism for the connectivity check, and this was done
 traditionally by storing the objects in the receiving repository
 and letting "git gc" to expire it.  Instead, store the newly
 received objects in a temporary area, and make them available by
 reusing the alternate object store mechanism to them only while we
 decide if we accept the check, and once we decide, either migrate
 them to the repository or purge them immediately.

 Will merge to 'next' after whipping jk/alt-odb-cleanup into shape.


* rs/qsort (2016-10-03) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-10-06 at 32a5bd3c88)
 + show-branch: use QSORT
 + use QSORT, part 2
 + coccicheck: use --all-includes by default
 + remove unnecessary check before QSORT
 + use QSORT
 + add QSORT

 We call "qsort(array, nelem, sizeof(array[0]), fn)", and most of
 the time third parameter is redundant.  A new QSORT() macro lets us
 omit it.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/alt-odb-cleanup (2016-10-05) 19 commits
 - alternates: use fspathcmp to detect duplicates
 - sha1_file: always allow relative paths to alternates
 - count-objects: report alternates via verbose mode
 - fill_sha1_file: write into a strbuf
 - alternates: store scratch buffer as strbuf
 - fill_sha1_file: write "boring" characters
 - alternates: use a separate scratch space

  (merged to 'next' on 2016-09-28 at c8673e03c2)
 + utf8: accept "latin-1" as ISO-8859-1
 + utf8: refactor code to decide fallback encoding

 Some platforms no longer understand "latin-1" that is still seen in
 the wild in e-mail headers; replace them with "iso-8859-1" that is
 more widely known when conversion fails from/to it.

 Will hold to see if people scream.


* mg/gpg-richer-status (2016-10-06) 2 commits
 - SQUASH: gpg-interface: use more status letters
 - gpg-interface: use more status letters

 The GPG verification status shown in "%G?" pretty format specifier
 was not rich enough to differentiate a signature made by an expired
 key, a signature made by a revoked key, etc.  New output letters
 have been assigned to express them.

 Waiting for a response to ping/squash.


* jc/blame-reverse (2016-06-14) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-09-22 at d1a8e9ce99)
 + blame: dwim "blame --reverse OLD" as "blame --reverse OLD.."
 + blame: improve diagnosis for "--reverse NEW"

 It is a common mistake to say "git blame --reverse OLD path",
 expecting that the command line is dwimmed as if asking how lines
 in path in an old revision OLD have survived up to the current
 commit.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* js/libify-require-clean-work-tree (2016-10-05) 6 commits
 - wt-status: begin error messages with lower-case
 - wt-status: teach has_{unstaged,uncommitted}_changes() about submodules
 - wt-status: export also the has_un{staged,committed}_changed()
 - wt-status: make the require_clean_work_tree() function reusable
 - pull: make code more similar to the shell script again
 - pull: drop confusing prefix parameter of die_on_unclean_work_tree()

 The require_clean_work_tree() helper was recreated in C when "git
 pull" was rewritten from shell; the helper is now made available to
 other callers in preparation for upcoming "rebase -i" work.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* bw/ls-files-recurse-submodules (2016-10-03) 4 commits

 - ls-files: optionally recurse into submodules
 - git: make super-prefix option

 "git ls-files" learned "--recurse-submodules" option that can be
 used to get a listing of tracked files across submodules (i.e. this
 only works with "--cached" option, not for listing untracked or
 ignored files).  This would be a useful tool to sit on the upstream
 side of a pipe that is read with xargs to work on all working tree
 files from the top-level superproject.

 Looking good.  Is this ready for 'next'?

 - convert: modernize tests
 - convert: quote filter names in error messages

 The smudge/clean filter API expect an external process is spawned
 to filter the contents for each path that has a filter defined.  A
 new type of "process" filter API has been added to allow the first
 request to run the filter for a path to spawn a single process, and
 all filtering need is served by this single process for multiple
 paths, reducing the process creation overhead.


* hv/submodule-not-yet-pushed-fix (2016-09-14) 2 commits
 - serialize collection of refs that contain submodule changes
 - serialize collection of changed submodules

 The code in "git push" to compute if any commit being pushed in the
 superproject binds a commit in a submodule that hasn't been pushed
 out was overly inefficient, making it unusable even for a small
 project that does not have any submodule but have a reasonable
 number of refs.

 The last two in the original series seem to break a few tests when
 queued to 'pu', and dropped for now.

 Waiting for a reroll.


* sg/fix-versioncmp-with-common-suffix (2016-09-08) 5 commits
 - versioncmp: cope with common leading parts in versionsort.prereleaseSuffix
 - versioncmp: pass full tagnames to swap_prereleases()
 - t7004-tag: add version sort tests to show prerelease reordering issues
 - t7004-tag: use test_config helper
 - t7004-tag: delete unnecessary tags with test_when_finished

 The prereleaseSuffix feature of version comparison that is used in
 "git tag -l" did not correctly when two or more prereleases for the
 same release were present (e.g. when 2.0, 2.0-beta1, and 2.0-beta2
 are there and the code needs to compare 2.0-beta1 and 2.0-beta2).

 Waiting for a reroll.

 Turn the default of "push.recurseSubmodules" to "check" when
 submodules seem to be in use.

* ak/curl-imap-send-explicit-scheme (2016-08-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-09-22 at 4449584c26)
 + imap-send: Tell cURL to use imap:// or imaps://

 When we started cURL to talk to imap server when a new enough
 version of cURL library is available, we forgot to explicitly add
 imap(s):// before the destination.  To some folks, that didn't work
 and the library tried to make HTTP(s) requests instead.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 + pack-objects: break delta cycles before delta-search phase
 + sha1_file: make packed_object_info public
 + provide an initializer for "struct object_info"

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2016-08-11

 "git pack-objects" in a repository with many packfiles used to
 spend a lot of time looking for/at objects in them; the accesses to
 the packfiles are now optimized by checking the most-recently-used
 packfile first.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 The ./configure script generated from configure.ac was taught how
 to detect support of SSL by libcurl better.

* jc/pull-rebase-ff (2016-07-28) 1 commit
 - pull: fast-forward "pull --rebase=true"

 "git pull --rebase", when there is no new commits on our side since
 we forked from the upstream, should be able to fast-forward without
 invoking "git rebase", but it didn't.

 Needs a real log message and a few tests.


* ex/deprecate-empty-pathspec-as-match-all (2016-06-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-09-21 at e19148ea63)
 + pathspec: warn on empty strings as pathspec

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2016-07-13

 An empty string used as a pathspec element has always meant
 'everything matches', but it is too easy to write a script that
 finds a path to remove in $path and run 'git rm "$paht"', which
 ends up removing everything.  Start warning about this use of an
 empty string used for 'everything matches' and ask users to use a
 more explicit '.' for that instead.

 The hope is that existing users will not mind this change, and
 eventually the warning can be turned into a hard error, upgrading
 the deprecation into removal of this (mis)feature.

 Will hold to see if people scream.

 + fetch-pack: use a separate flag for fetch in deepening mode
 + fetch-pack.c: mark strings for translating
 + fetch-pack: use a common function for verbose printing
 + fetch-pack: use skip_prefix() instead of starts_with()
 + upload-pack: move rev-list code out of check_non_tip()
 + upload-pack: make check_non_tip() clean things up on error
 + upload-pack: tighten number parsing at "deepen" lines
 + upload-pack: use skip_prefix() instead of starts_with()
 + upload-pack: move "unshallow" sending code out of deepen()
 + upload-pack: remove unused variable "backup"
 + upload-pack: move "shallow" sending code out of deepen()
 + upload-pack: move shallow deepen code out of receive_needs()
 + transport-helper.c: refactor set_helper_option()
 + remote-curl.c: convert fetch_git() to use argv_array

 The existing "git fetch --depth=<n>" option was hard to use
 correctly when making the history of an existing shallow clone
 deeper.  A new option, "--deepen=<n>", has been added to make this
 easier to use.  "git clone" also learned "--shallow-since=<date>"
 and "--shallow-exclude=<tag>" options to make it easier to specify
 "I am interested only in the recent N months worth of history" and
 "Give me only the history since that version".

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/merge-drop-old-syntax (2015-04-29) 1 commit
 - merge: drop 'git merge <message> HEAD <commit>' syntax

 Stop supporting "git merge <message> HEAD <commit>" syntax that has
 been deprecated since October 2007, and issues a deprecation
 warning message since v2.5.0.

 It has been reported that git-gui still uses the deprecated syntax,
 which needs to be fixed before this final step can proceed.
