What's cooking in git.git (Jul 2010, #04; Mon, 19)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones
marked with '.' do not appear in any of the integration branches, but I am
still holding onto them.

I've ended up merging a few more fixes to 'master'; please give it a good
final round of testing so that we can have the real thing in a couple of
days.

Thanks.

[Graduated to "master"]

 + git submodule add: Require the new --force option to add ignored paths

* by/log-range-diff (2010-07-12) 18 commits
 . Minimum fix to make by/log-range-diff topic at least compile
 . add test cases for '--graph' of line level log
 . line.c output the '--graph' padding before each line
 . add parent rewrite feature to line level log
 . make rewrite_parents an external function
 . some document update
 . add two test cases
 . add --always-print option
 . map/print ranges along traversing the history topologically
 . print the line log
 . map/take range to parent
 . add range clone functions
 . export three functions from diff.c

Seems to break some tests in t403X range but we are not in a hurry.

* ps/gitweb-soc (2010-06-02) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-06-13 at 92245ae)
 + git-instaweb: Add option to reuse previous config file
 + Makefile: Use $(sharedir)/gitweb for target 'install-gitweb'

If we are going to have a configuration variable to control this, I
strongly suspect that --reuse-config should be renamed so that the
variable can be named more sanely and in line with whatever option
that replaces it.

No responses; I think we will eventually want to have a configuration to
always enable the new option, so the renaming of the command line option
is inevitable.  I plan to kick this out of 'next' once the upcoming
release is out, and expect a re-roll with configuration variable.

* js/rebase-origin-x (2010-02-05) 1 commit
 - [RFC w/o test and incomplete] rebase: add -x option to record original commit name

I retract my objection against the idea of -x; needs polishing before
moving forward.

No responses; I plan to drop this entirely after the upcoming release
without prejudice.

* zl/mailinfo-recode-patch (2010-06-14) 2 commits

I recall there was another round of re-roll planned for this one.
