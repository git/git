Subject: What's cooking in git.git (Apr 2020, #02; Mon, 20)
X-master-at: 048abe1751e6727bfbacf7b80466d78e04631f94

What's cooking in git.git (Apr 2020, #02; Mon, 20)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

Having to issue two security fixes on a pair of very similar issues
was embarrassing, but hopefully that's behind us.  Let's restart
merging things down.  I am hoping that we can merge all topics
marked to be merged to 'next' by early next week, so please make
loud noises if I mistakenly marked stuff that are not yet ready.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-15 at 11d6110e99)
 + clone: use "quick" lookup while following tags

 The logic to auto-follow tags by "git clone --single-branch" was
 not careful to avoid lazy-fetching unnecessary tags, which has been
 corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 "git rebase" learned the "--no-gpg-sign" option to countermand
 commit.gpgSign the user may have.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* en/rebase-doc-hooks-called-by-accident (2020-04-05) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-20 at 1011f8a876)
 + git-rebase.txt: add another hook to the hooks section, and explain more

 "git rebase" happens to call some hooks meant for "checkout" and
 "commit" by this was not a designed behaviour than historical
 accident.  This has been documented.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/fast-import-use-hashmap (2020-04-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-20 at 76e8908efe)

* eb/format-patch-no-encode-headers (2020-04-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-15 at 368840cd6c)
 + format-patch: teach --no-encode-email-headers

 The output from "git format-patch" uses RFC 2047 encoding for
 non-ASCII letters on From: and Subject: headers, so that it can
 directly be fed to e-mail programs.  A new option has been added
 to produce these headers in raw.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* js/mingw-fixes (2020-04-10) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-15 at 11a3d39d2b)

* pw/rebase-i-more-options (2020-04-07) 7 commits
 - SQUASH??? - avoid test numbering crashes
 - t3433: improve coverage
 - Revert "sequencer: allow callers of read_author_script() to ignore fields"
 - rebase -i: fix --committer-date-is-author-date
 - t3433: only compare commit dates
 - t3433: remove loops from tests
 - Revert "Revert "Merge branch 'ra/rebase-i-more-options'""

 "git rebase -i" learns a bit more options.

 Expecting a reroll.

* bc/constant-memequal (2020-04-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-20 at 31180dae7d)

* ds/revision-show-pulls (2020-04-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-15 at 89b4d86a3a)
 + revision: --show-pulls adds helpful merges

 "git log" learned "--show-pulls" that helps pathspec limited
 history views; a merge commit that takes the whole change from a
 side branch, which is normally omitted from the output, is shown
 in addition to the commits that introduce real changes.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* en/rebase-no-keep-empty (2020-04-11) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-15 at 9908cee7c0)
 + rebase: fix an incompatible-options error message
 + rebase: reinstate --no-keep-empty
 + rebase -i: mark commits that begin empty in todo editor
 (this branch is used by jt/rebase-allow-duplicate.)

 "git rebase" (again) learns to honor "--no-keep-empty", which lets
 the user to discard commits that are empty from the beginning (as
 opposed to the ones that become empty because of rebasing).  The
 interactive rebase also marks commits that are empty in the todo.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/missing-ref-store-fix (2020-04-09) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-15 at 83caf48c7a)
 + repository: mark the "refs" pointer as private
 + sha1-name: do not assume that the ref store is initialized

 We've left the command line parsing of "git log :/a/b/" broken for
 about a full year without anybody noticing, which has been
 corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/config-use-size-t (2020-04-10) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-20 at 4af9fea74f)
 + config: reject parsing of files over INT_MAX
 + config: use size_t to store parsed variable baselen
 + git_config_parse_key(): return baselen as size_t
 + config: drop useless length variable in write_pair()
 + parse_config_key(): return subsection len as size_t
 + remote: drop auto-strlen behavior of make_branch() and make_rewrite()

 The config API made mixed uses of int and size_t types to represent
 length of various pieces of text it parsed, which has been updated
 to use the correct type (i.e. size_t) throughout.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* js/flush-prompt-before-interative-input (2020-04-10) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-15 at 051407eb3a)
 + interactive: explicitly `fflush` stdout before expecting input
 + interactive: refactor code asking the user for interactive input

 The interactive input from various codepaths are consolidated and
 any prompt possibly issued earlier are fflush()ed before we read.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* js/mingw-is-hidden-test-fix (2020-04-11) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-15 at 1e11f552f7)
 + t: restrict `is_hidden` to be called only on Windows
 + mingw: make test_path_is_hidden more robust
 + t: consolidate the `is_hidden` functions

 A Windows-specific test element has been made more robust against
 misuse from both user's environment and programmer's errors.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* js/mingw-isilon-nfs (2020-04-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-15 at 4bac536980)
 + mingw: cope with the Isilon network file system

 Will merge to 'master'.

 + merge: use skip_prefix to parse config key

 Code simplification.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ds/blame-on-bloom (2020-04-16) 3 commits
 - blame: use changed-path Bloom filters
 - tests: write commit-graph with Bloom filters
 - revision: complicated pathspecs disable filters
 (this branch uses gs/commit-graph-path-filter.)

 "git blame" learns to take advantage of the "changed-paths" Bloom
 filter stored in the commit-graph file.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* dd/iso-8601-updates (2020-04-15) 2 commits
 - date.c: allow compact version of ISO-8601 datetime
 - date.c: skip fractional second part of ISO-8601

 The approxidate parser learns to parse seconds with fraction.

 Expecting further work.
 cf. <20200417133647.GA26701@danh.dev>


* ds/log-exclude-decoration-config (2020-04-16) 2 commits
 - log: add log.excludeDecoration config option
 - log-tree: make ref_filter_match() a helper method

 The "--decorate-refs" and "--decorate-refs-exclude" options "git
 log" takes have learned a companion configuration variable
 log.excludeDecoration that sits at the lowest priority in the
 family.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/credential-parsing-end-of-host-in-URL (2020-04-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-15 at 55bc3eb7cb)

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ag/rebase-merge-allow-ff-under-abbrev-command (2020-03-30) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-15 at b4679f7c7c)
 + t3432: test `--merge' with `rebase.abbreviateCommands = true', too
 + sequencer: don't abbreviate a command if it doesn't have a short form

 "git rebase" with the merge backend did not work well when the
 rebase.abbreviateCommands configuration was set.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jx/proc-receive-hook (2020-04-15) 8 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - doc: add documentation for the proc-receive hook
 - receive-pack: new config receive.procReceiveRefs
 - refs.c: refactor to reuse ref_is_hidden()
 - send-pack: extension for client-side status report
 - receive-pack: add new proc-receive hook

 "git receive-pack" that accepts requests by "git push" learned to
 outsource most of the ref updates to the new "proc-receive" hook.


* dr/midx-avoid-int-underflow (2020-03-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-15 at eb2343a5eb)
 + midx.c: fix an integer underflow

 When fed a midx that records no objects, some codepaths tried to
 loop from 0 through (num_objects-1), which, due to integer
 arithmetic wrapping around, made it nonsense operation with out of
 bounds array accesses.  The code has been corrected to reject such
 an midx file.

* ak/run-command-on-cygwin-fix (2020-03-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-15 at 9e98b82a7f)
 + run-command: trigger PATH lookup properly on Cygwin

 Utitiles run via the run_command() API were not spawned correctly
 on Cygwin, when the paths to them are given as a full path with
 backslashes.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* dd/ci-musl-libc (2020-04-06) 6 commits
 + travis: build and test on Linux with musl libc and busybox
 + ci/linux32: libify install-dependencies step
 + ci: refactor docker runner script
 + ci/linux32: parameterise command to switch arch
 + ci/lib-docker: preserve required environment variables

* dr/doc-recurse-submodules (2020-04-06) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-20 at 601e10f9a1)

* dr/push-remoteref-fix (2020-04-06) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-15 at ecf60dc488)
 + remote.c: fix handling of %(push:remoteref)
 + remote.c: fix %(push) for triangular workflows

 The "%(push:remoteref)" placeholder in the "--format=" argument of
 "git format-patch" (and friends) only showed what got explicitly
 configured, not what ref at the receiving end would be updated when
 "git push" was used, as it ignored the default behaviour (e.g. update
 the same ref as the source).

* jc/doc-test-leaving-early (2020-03-29) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-20 at 4bd94585d1)

 Document the recommended way to abort a failing test early (e.g. by
 exiting a loop), which is to say "return 1".

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/build-with-right-curl (2020-04-05) 3 commits
 - Makefile: avoid running curl-config unnecessarily
 - Makefile: use curl-config --cflags
 - Makefile: avoid running curl-config multiple times

 The build procedure did not use the libcurl library and its include
 files correctly for a custom-built installation.

 On hold.

  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-15 at c983535405)
 + test-lib-functions: simplify packetize() stdin code
 + upload-pack: handle unexpected delim packets

 - git-update-ref.txt: add missing word
 - refs: fix segfault when aborting empty transaction

 "git update-ref --stdin" learned a handful of new verbs to let the
 user control ref update transactions more explicitly, which helps
 as an ingredient to implement two-phase commit-style atomic
 ref-updates across multiple repositories.

 + pull: avoid running both merge and rebase

 "git pull --rebase" tried to run a rebase even after noticing that
 the pull results in a fast-forward and no rebase is needed nor
 sensible, for the past few years due to a mistake nobody noticed.

  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-15 at 408afae2c9)
 + import-tars: ignore the global PAX header

 The import-tars importer (in contrib/fast-import/) used to create
 phony files at the top-level of the repository when the archive
 contains global PAX headers, which made its own logic to detect and
 omit the common leading directory ineffective, which has been
 corrected.

 . rebase: do not switch the default to 'merge' just yet

 The "merge" backend of "git rebase" still has a few bugs and
 unexpected behaviour that need to be ironed out before it becomes
 the default.  Let's switch the default back to the "apply" backend
 for now.

 options to control if the resulting graph chains should be merged
 or a single new incremental graph is created.

 Discarded---tb/commit-graph-split-strategy supersedes this.
