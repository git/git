What's cooking in git.git (Jul 2023, #05; Tue, 25)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and
aren't considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL
to a message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity (of course they can be resubmit when new interests
arise).

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

Release tarballs are available at:

  (merged to 'next' on 2023-07-17 at b040e8280e)
 + push: don't imply that integration is always required before pushing
 + remote: don't imply that integration is always required before pushing
 + wt-status: don't show divergence advice when committing

 Help newbies by suggesting that there are cases where force-pushing
 is a valid and sensible thing to update a branch at a remote
 repository, rather than reconciling with merge/rebase.

 - sequencer: finish parsing the todo list despite an invalid first line

 When the user edits "rebase -i" todo file so that it starts with a
 "fixup", which would make it invalid, the command truncated the
 rest of the file before giving an error and returning the control
 back to the user.  Stop truncating to make it easier to correct
 such a malformed todo file.

 traditional SHA-1 repositories, but at this point, we do not plan
 to make breaking changes to SHA-256 repositories and there is no

 The implementation of "get_sha1_hex()" that reads a hexadecimal
 string that spells a full object name has been extended to cope
 with any hash function used in the repository, but the "sha1" in
 its name survived.  Rename it to get_hash_hex(), a name that is

 - branch: update the message to refuse touching a branch in-use

 "git branch -f X" to repoint the branch X seid that X was "checked
 out" in another worktree, even when branch X was not and instead
 being bisected or rebased.  The message was reworded to say the
 branch was "in use".

 Will merge to 'next'?
