What's cooking in git.git (Mar 2021, #01; Tue, 2)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'seen' (formerly 'pu'---proposed updates) while commits prefixed
with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

A release candidate Git v2.31.0-rc1 has been tagged.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

Release tarballs are available at:

[Graduated to 'master']

* ab/detox-gettext-tests (2021-02-10) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-17 at bd3d771557)
 + tests: remove most uses of test_i18ncmp
 + tests: remove last uses of C_LOCALE_OUTPUT
 + tests: remove most uses of C_LOCALE_OUTPUT
 + tests: remove last uses of GIT_TEST_GETTEXT_POISON=false

 Removal of GIT_TEST_GETTEXT_POISON continues.


* ab/diff-deferred-free (2021-02-11) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-12 at 5e24106122)
 + diff: plug memory leak from regcomp() on {log,diff} -I
 + diff: add an API for deferred freeing

 A small memleak in "diff -I<regexp>" has been corrected.


* ab/pager-exit-log (2021-02-01) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-12 at ffe9f2d364)
 + pager: properly log pager exit code when signalled
 + run-command: add braces for "if" block in wait_or_whine()
 + pager: test for exit code with and without SIGPIPE
 + pager: refactor wait_for_pager() function

 When a pager spawned by us exited, the trace log did not record its
 exit status correctly, which has been corrected.
 The original "what should we do with SIGPIPE?" question remains, though.


* ab/test-lib (2021-02-12) 11 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-12 at 666a0422dc)
 + test-lib-functions: assert correct parameter count
 + test-lib-functions: remove bug-inducing "diagnostics" helper param
 + test libs: rename "diff-lib" to "lib-diff"
 + t/.gitattributes: sort lines
 + test-lib-functions: move function to lib-bitmap.sh
 + test libs: rename gitweb-lib.sh to lib-gitweb.sh
 + test libs: rename bundle helper to "lib-bundle.sh"
 + test-lib-functions: remove generate_zero_bytes() wrapper
 + test-lib-functions: move test_set_index_version() to its user
 + test lib: change "error" to "BUG" as appropriate
 + test-lib: remove check_var_migration
 (this branch is used by ab/pickaxe-pcre2.)

 Test framework clean-up.


* ah/commit-graph-leakplug (2021-02-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-22 at 1330b452db)
 + commit-graph: avoid leaking topo_levels slab in write_commit_graph()

 Plug a minor memory leak.


* ah/rebase-no-fork-point-config (2021-02-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-24 at 8e56891909)
 + rebase: add a config option for --no-fork-point

 "git rebase --[no-]fork-point" gained a configuration variable
 rebase.forkPoint so that users do not have to keep specifying a
 non-default setting.


* bc/signed-objects-with-both-hashes (2021-02-10) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-11 at 391cc85104)
 + gpg-interface: remove other signature headers before verifying
 + ref-filter: hoist signature parsing
 + commit: allow parsing arbitrary buffers with headers
 + gpg-interface: improve interface for parsing tags
 + commit: ignore additional signatures when parsing signed commits
 + ref-filter: switch some uses of unsigned long to size_t

 Signed commits and tags now allow verification of objects, whose
 two object names (one in SHA-1, the other in SHA-256) are both
 signed.


* cw/pack-config-doc (2021-02-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-22 at cfd2f5ccd1)
 + doc: mention bigFileThreshold for packing

 Doc update.


* dl/doc-config-camelcase (2021-02-24) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-24 at 5315e84c47)
 + index-format doc: camelCase core.excludesFile
 + blame-options.txt: camelcase blame.blankBoundary
 + i18n.txt: camel case and monospace "i18n.commitEncoding"

 A handful of multi-word configuration variable names in
 documentation that are spelled in all lowercase have been corrected
 to use the more canonical camelCase.


* dl/stash-cleanup (2021-02-11) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-11 at ae1cde1380)
 + stash: declare ref_stash as an array
 + t3905: use test_cmp() to check file contents
 + t3905: replace test -s with test_file_not_empty
 + t3905: remove nested git in command substitution
 + t3905: move all commands into test cases
 + t3905: remove spaces after redirect operators
 + git-stash.txt: be explicit about subcommand options
 (this branch is used by dl/stash-show-untracked.)

 Documentation, code and test clean-up around "git stash".
 This is an early part of a topic that added a new feature to the
 command, but the implementation is expected to need a handful of
 iterations; I split the preparatory part up to fast-track it.


* ds/chunked-file-api (2021-02-24) 18 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-24 at 6002da063c)
 + commit-graph.c: display correct number of chunks when writing
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-22 at 5f0e28cfb2)
 + chunk-format: add technical docs
 + chunk-format: restore duplicate chunk checks
 + midx: use 64-bit multiplication for chunk sizes
 + midx: use chunk-format read API
 + commit-graph: use chunk-format read API
 + chunk-format: create read chunk API
 + midx: use chunk-format API in write_midx_internal()
 + midx: drop chunk progress during write
 + midx: return success/failure in chunk write methods
 + midx: add num_large_offsets to write_midx_context
 + midx: add pack_perm to write_midx_context
 + midx: add entries to write_midx_context
 + midx: use context in write_midx_pack_names()
 + midx: rename pack_info to write_midx_context
 + commit-graph: use chunk-format write API
 + chunk-format: create chunk format write API
 + commit-graph: anonymize data in chunk_write_fn
 (this branch is used by ds/commit-graph-generation-config and tb/reverse-midx.)

 The common code to deal with "chunked file format" that is shared
 by the multi-pack-index and commit-graph files have been factored
 out, to help codepaths for both filetypes to become more robust.


* ds/merge-base-independent (2021-02-22) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-24 at 9fad5352ea)
 + commit-reach: stale commits may prune generation further
 + commit-reach: use heuristic in remove_redundant()
 + commit-reach: move compare_commits_by_gen
 + commit-reach: use one walk in remove_redundant()
 + commit-reach: reduce requirements for remove_redundant()

 The code to implement "git merge-base --independent" was poorly
 done and was kept from the very beginning of the feature.


* en/diffcore-rename (2021-02-15) 8 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-22 at 243d0182da)
 + merge-ort: call diffcore_rename() directly

 + diffcore-rename: guide inexact rename detection based on basenames
 + diffcore-rename: complete find_basename_matches()
 + diffcore-rename: compute basenames of source and dest candidates
 + t4001: add a test comparing basename similarity and content similarity
 + diffcore-rename: filter rename_src list when possible
 + diffcore-rename: no point trying to find a match better than exact

 Performance optimization work on the rename detection continues.


* es/maintenance-of-bare-repositories (2021-02-23) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-24 at 73a40e23b3)
 + maintenance: fix incorrect `maintenance.repo` path with bare repository

 The "git maintenance register" command had trouble registering bare
 repositories, which had been corrected.


* hn/reftable-tables-doc-update (2021-02-23) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-25 at cfeadb4945)
 + doc/reftable: document how to handle windows

 Documentation update.


* hv/trailer-formatting (2021-02-15) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-25 at 7d1d5ecf59)
 + ref-filter: use pretty.c logic for trailers
 + pretty.c: capture invalid trailer argument
 + pretty.c: refactor trailer logic to `format_set_trailers_options()`
 + t6300: use function to test trailer options

 The logic to handle "trailer" related placeholders in the
 "--format=" mechanisms in the "log" family and "for-each-ref"
 family is getting unified.


* jc/diffcore-rotate (2021-02-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-22 at f17c341d20)
 + diff: --{rotate,skip}-to=<path>
 (this branch is used by zh/difftool-skip-to.)

 "git {diff,log} --{skip,rotate}-to=<path>" allows the user to
 discard diff output for early paths or move them to the end of the
 output.


* jc/maint-column-doc-typofix (2021-02-19) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-22 at d927f64824)
 + Documentation: typofix --column description

 Doc update.


* jc/push-delete-nothing (2021-02-23) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-24 at 9d5481ea10)
 + push: do not turn --delete '' into a matching push

 "git push $there --delete ''" should have been diagnosed as an
 error, but instead turned into a matching push, which has been
 corrected.


* jh/fsmonitor-prework (2021-02-16) 11 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-17 at 1943efb5ac)

  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-25 at 79d1e40211)
 + dir: fix malloc of root untracked_cache_dir

 An under-allocation for the untracked cache data has been corrected.


* jk/rev-list-disk-usage (2021-02-17) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-22 at 37a29a3495)
 + docs/rev-list: add some examples of --disk-usage
 + docs/rev-list: add an examples section
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-11 at 6fb701f287)
 + rev-list: add --disk-usage option for calculating disk usage
 + t: add --no-tag option to test_commit
 (this branch is used by ab/pickaxe-pcre2.)

 "git rev-list" command learned "--disk-usage" option.


* js/doc-proto-v2-response-end (2021-02-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-17 at 9d5d479469)
 + doc: fix naming of response-end-pkt

 Docfix.


* js/params-vs-args (2021-02-23) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-24 at 0a1ff0bc16)
 + replace "parameters" by "arguments" in error messages

 Messages update.


* jt/transfer-fsck-across-packs (2021-02-22) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-22 at 76f1327431)
 + fetch-pack: print and use dangling .gitmodules
 + fetch-pack: with packfile URIs, use index-pack arg
 + http-fetch: allow custom index-pack args
 + http: allow custom index-pack args

 The approach to "fsck" the incoming objects in "index-pack" is
 attractive for performance reasons (we have them already in core,
 inflated and ready to be inspected), but fundamentally cannot be
 applied fully when we receive more than one pack stream, as a tree
 object in one pack may refer to a blob object in another pack as
 ".gitmodules", when we want to inspect blobs that are used as
 ".gitmodules" file, for example.  Teach "index-pack" to emit
 objects that must be inspected later and check them in the calling
 "fetch-pack" process.


* ma/doc-markup-fix (2021-02-18) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-22 at a8e9e712c8)
 + gitmailmap.txt: fix rendering of e-mail addresses
 + git.txt: fix monospace rendering
 + rev-list-options.txt: fix rendering of bonus paragraph

 Docfix.


* mt/add-chmod-fixes (2021-02-24) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-24 at 6c0977f3be)
 + add: propagate --chmod errors to exit status
 + add: mark --chmod error string for translation
 + add --chmod: don't update index when --dry-run is used

 Various fixes on "git add --chmod".


* mt/checkout-index-corner-cases (2021-02-16) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-17 at 81dad9735b)
 + checkout-index: omit entries with no tempname from --temp output
 + write_entry(): fix misuses of `path` in error messages

 The error codepath around the "--temp/--prefix" feature of "git
 checkout-index" has been improved.


* mt/grep-sparse-checkout (2021-02-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-24 at 246fc2ad56)
 + grep: honor sparse-checkout on working tree searches

 "git grep" has been tweaked to be limited to the sparse checkout
 paths.


* mz/doc-notes-are-not-anchors (2021-02-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-17 at 81f92a74b2)
 + docs: clarify that refs/notes/ do not keep the attached objects alive

 Objects that lost references can be pruned away, even when they
 have notes attached to it (and these notes will become dangling,
 which in turn can be pruned with "git notes prune").  This has been
 clarified in the documentation.


* ns/raise-write-index-buffer-size (2021-02-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-25 at 8f43f67ba7)
 + read-cache: make the index write buffer size 128K

 Raise the buffer size used when writing the index file out from
 (obviously too small) 8kB to (clearly sufficiently large) 128kB.
 We may want to extend this to use a value the platform suggests as
 the best size with a follow-up patch, but this should do for now.


* rs/blame-optim (2021-02-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-17 at e54665eeb3)
 + blame: remove unnecessary use of get_commit_info()

  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-24 at dbd4c6684c)
 + mergetools/vimdiff: add vimdiff1 merge tool variant

 Mergetools update.


* sv/t7001-modernize (2021-02-11) 10 commits

 + doc: mention approxidates for git-commit --date

 Doc update.


* zh/difftool-skip-to (2021-02-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-22 at eeff734f2b)
 + difftool.c: learn a new way start at specified file
 (this branch uses jc/diffcore-rotate.)

 "git difftool" learned "--skip-to=<path>" option to restart an
 interrupted session from an arbitrary path.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* ab/remote-write-config-in-camel-case (2021-02-24) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-03-01 at a01bd0d8e4)
 + remote: write camel-cased *.pushRemote on rename

  (merged to 'next' on 2021-03-01 at 357954af7c)
 + convert: fail gracefully upon missing clean cmd on required filter

 We had a code to diagnose and die cleanly when a required
 clean/smudge filter is missing, but an assert before that
 unnecessarily fired, hiding the end-user facing die() message.

 Will cook in 'next'.

* jk/symlinked-dotgitx-files (2020-10-23) 9 commits
 - docs: document symlink restrictions for .git* files
 - fsck: complain when .gitattributes or .gitignore is a symlink
 - verify_path(): disallow symlinks in .gitattributes and .gitignore
 - t0060: test obscured .gitattributes and .gitignore matching
 - t7450: test .gitmodules symlink matching against obscured names
 - t7450: test verify_path() handling of gitmodules
 - t7415: rename to expand scope
 - fsck_tree(): wrap some long lines
 - fsck_tree(): fix shadowed variable

 "git fsck" and the corresponding check done during the transport
 learned to ensure that in-tree files like `.gitignore` and
 `.gitattributes` are not symbolic links.

 It seems that there are real projects with .gitignore recorded as
 symlinks, which may need to loosen the fsck setting.  Do we need to
 introduce a class that is separate from symlinked .gitmodules that
 has potential consequences that is more/less grave, so that these
 projects can opt out of the new checks?

* ab/make-cleanup (2021-02-23) 6 commits
 - Makefile: build "$(FUZZ_OBJS)" in CI, not under "all"
 - Makefile: add {program,xdiff,test,git,fuzz}-objs & objects targets
 - Makefile: split OBJECTS into OBJECTS and GIT_OBJS
 - Makefile: sort OBJECTS assignment for subsequent change

 - Makefile: guard against TEST_OBJS in the environment

 Reorganize Makefile to allow building git.o and other essential
 objects without extra stuff needed only for testing.

 The last step is of dubious value, but otherwise looked OK.

* cm/rebase-i-fixup-amend-reword (2021-03-01) 6 commits
 - doc/git-commit: add documentation for fixup=[amend|reword] options
 - t3437: use --fixup with options to create amend! commit
 - t7500: add tests for --fixup=[amend|reword] options
 - commit: add a reword suboption to --fixup
 - commit: add amend suboption to --fixup to create amend! commit
 - sequencer: export subject_length()
 (this branch uses cm/rebase-i and cm/rebase-i-updates.)

 "git commit --fixup=<commit>", which was to tweak the changes made
 to the contents while keeping the original log message intact,
 learned "--fixup=(amend|reword):<commit>", that can be used to
 tweak both the message and the contents, and only the message,
 respectively.

 Getting there.

* jk/open-dotgitx-with-nofollow (2021-02-16) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-25 at a784bf7be6)
 + mailmap: do not respect symlinks for in-tree .mailmap
 + exclude: do not respect symlinks for in-tree .gitignore
 + attr: do not respect symlinks for in-tree .gitattributes
 + exclude: add flags parameter to add_patterns()
 + attr: convert "macro_ok" into a flags field
 + add open_nofollow() helper

 It does not make sense to make ".gitattributes", ".gitignore" and
 ".mailmap" symlinks, as they are supposed to be usable from the
 object store (think: bare repositories where HEAD:.mailmap etc. are
 used).  When these files are symbolic links, we used to read the
 contents of the files pointed by them by mistake, which has been
 corrected.

 Will cook in 'next'.

 "git repack" so far has been only capable of repacking everything
 under the sun into a single pack (or split by size).  A cleverer
 strategy to reduce the cost of repacking a repository has been
 introduced.
