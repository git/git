What's cooking in git.git (May 2020, #02; Tue, 5)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

 cf. <20200428033611.GB2369457@coredump.intra.peff.net>


* jk/test-fail-prereqs-fix (2020-04-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-28 at 75787711c0)
 + t0000: disable GIT_TEST_FAIL_PREREQS in sub-tests

 Test update.


* js/anonymise-push-url-in-errors (2020-04-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-28 at 49539cf116)
 + push: anonymize URLs in error messages and warnings

 Error and verbose trace messages from "git push" did not redact
 credential material embedded in URLs.


* js/partial-urlmatch (2020-04-29) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-05-01 at e7017fcfd1)
 + Sync with js/partial-urlmatch-2.17
 + credential: handle `credential.<partial-URL>.<key>` again
 + credential: optionally allow partial URLs in credential_from_url_gently()
 (this branch uses js/partial-urlmatch-2.17.)

 The same as js/partial-urlmatch-2.17, built on more recent codebase
 to avoid unnecessary merge conflicts.


* js/partial-urlmatch-2.17 (2020-04-29) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-05-01 at 7c69571f89)
 + credential: handle `credential.<partial-URL>.<key>` again
 + credential: optionally allow partial URLs in credential_from_url_gently()
 + credential: fix grammar
 (this branch is used by js/partial-urlmatch.)

 Recent updates broke parsing of "credential.<url>.<key>" where
 <url> is not a full URL (e.g. [credential "https://"] helper = ...)
 stopped working, which has been corrected.


* jt/v2-fetch-nego-fix (2020-04-28) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-28 at c6f9ebf2f7)
 + fetch-pack: in protocol v2, reset in_vain upon ACK
 + fetch-pack: in protocol v2, in_vain only after ACK
 + fetch-pack: return enum from process_acks()

 The upload-pack protocol v2 gave up too early before finding a
 common ancestor, resulting in a wasteful fetch from a fork of a
 project.  This has been corrected to match the behaviour of v0
 protocol.


* mt/doc-worktree-ref (2020-04-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-28 at d96c05cb0a)
 + config doc: fix reference to config.worktree info

 + commit-graph.c: gracefully handle file descriptor exhaustion
 + t/test-lib.sh: make ULIMIT_FILE_DESCRIPTORS available to tests
 + commit-graph.c: don't use discarded graph_name in error
 (this branch is tangled with tb/commit-graph-split-strategy.)

 The commit-graph code exhausted file descriptors easily when it
 does not have to.


* tb/commit-graph-perm-bits (2020-04-29) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-29 at 66a87c1fbc)
 + commit-graph.c: make 'commit-graph-chain's read-only
 + commit-graph.c: ensure graph layers respect core.sharedRepository
 + commit-graph.c: write non-split graphs as read-only
 + lockfile.c: introduce 'hold_lock_file_for_update_mode'
 + tempfile.c: introduce 'create_tempfile_mode'

 Some of the files commit-graph subsystem keeps on disk did not
 correctly honor the core.sharedRepository settings and some were
 left read-write.


* tb/commit-graph-split-strategy (2020-04-29) 8 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-29 at 99fa922569)
 + Revert "commit-graph.c: introduce '--[no-]check-oids'"

 + builtin/commit-graph.c: support for '--split[=<strategy>]'
 + t/helper/test-read-graph.c: support commit-graph chains
 (this branch is tangled with tb/commit-graph-fd-exhaustion-fix.)

 "git commit-graph write" learned different ways to write out split
 files.


* tb/reset-shallow (2020-04-24) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-28 at 9510639ae8)
 + shallow.c: use '{commit,rollback}_shallow_file'
 + t5537: use test_write_lines and indented heredocs for readability
 (this branch is used by tb/shallow-cleanup.)

 Fix in-core inconsistency after fetching into a shallow repository
 that broke the code to write out commit-graph.

* ds/line-log-on-bloom (2020-05-01) 12 commits
 - line-log: integrate with changed-path Bloom filters
 - line-log: try to use generation number-based topo-ordering

 file, by adding appropriate quotes as needed..

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/for-each-ref-multi-key-sort-fix (2020-05-04) 2 commits
 - ref-filter: apply fallback refname sort only after all user sorts
 - ref-filter: apply --ignore-case to all sorting keys

 "git branch" and other "for-each-ref" variants accepted multiple
 --sort=<key> options in the increasing order of precedence, but it
 had a few breakages around "--ignore-case" handling, and tiebreaking
 with the refname, which have been fixed.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* js/rebase-autosquash-double-fixup-fix (2020-05-04) 1 commit
 - rebase --autosquash: fix a potential segfault

 "rebase -i" segfaulted when rearranging a sequence that has a
 fix-up that applies another fix-up (which may or may not be a
 fix-up of yet another step).

 Under review.

 The sparse-checkout patterns have been forbidden from excluding all
 paths, leaving an empty working tree, for a long time.  This
 limitation has been lifted.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/arith-expansion-coding-guidelines (2020-05-04) 1 commit
 - CodingGuidelines: drop arithmetic expansion advice to use "$x"

 The coding guideline for shell scripts instructed to refer to a
 variable with dollar-sign inside airthmetic expansion to work
 around a bug in old versions of dash, which is a thing of the past.
 Now we are not forbidden from writing $((var+1)).

 Will merge to 'next'.


* tb/bitmap-walk-with-tree-zero-filter (2020-05-04) 4 commits
 - pack-bitmap: pass object filter to fill-in traversal
 - pack-bitmap.c: support 'tree:0' filtering
 - pack-bitmap.c: make object filtering functions generic

* cb/avoid-colliding-with-netbsd-hmac (2020-05-05) 1 commit
 - builtin/receive-pack: avoid generic function name hmac()

 The <stdlib.h> header on NetBSD brings in its own definition of
 hmac() function (eek), which conflicts with our own and unrelated
 function with the same name.  Our function has been renamed to work
 around the issue.

 Will merge to 'next'.

* dd/ci-only-on-selective-branches (2020-05-05) 2 commits
 - CI: limit GitHub Actions to designated branches
 - SubmittingPatches: advertise GitHub Actions CI

 Instead of always building all branches of all forks of our project
 at GitHub via GitHub Actions, only build when branches with known
 and specific names are updated, and also a pull request.

 Expecting an update.
 cf. <cover.1588695295.git.congdanhqx@gmail.com>
 The description talks too much about helping (or not getting in the
 way of) the current maintainer, but the focus should instead be
 general contributors.

* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2018-10-15) 1 commit
 - zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

* cb/credential-store-ignore-bogus-lines (2020-05-02) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-05-05 at 5b919ec5d6)
 + credential-store: ignore bogus lines from store file
 + credential-store: document the file format a bit more

 With the recent tightening of the code that is used to parse
 various parts of a URL for use in the credential subsystem, a
 hand-edited credential-store file causes the credential helper to
 die, which is a bit too harsh to the users.  Demote the error
 behaviour to only warn and keep using well-formed lines instead.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* dl/switch-c-option-in-error-message (2020-04-30) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-05-05 at 472db48735)
 + switch: fix errors and comments related to -c and -C

 In error messages that "git switch" mentions its option to create a
 new branch, "-b/-B" options were shown, where "-c/-C" options
 should be, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* es/bugreport-with-hooks (2020-04-30) 2 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - bugreport: collect list of populated hooks

 "git bugreport" learned to report enabled hooks in the repository.

 - completion: add tests showing lack of support for git switch -c/-C
 - completion: add test highlighting subpar git switch --track completion
 - completion: add test showing subpar git switch completion

 The command line completion (in contrib/) learned to complete
 options that the "git switch" command takes.

 Needs review.


* dr/push-remoteref-fix (2020-04-23) 1 commit
 - remote.c: fix handling of %(push:remoteref)

 The "%(push:remoteref)" placeholder in the "--format=" argument of
 "git format-patch" (and friends) only showed what got explicitly
 configured, not what ref at the receiving end would be updated when
 "git push" was used, as it ignored the default behaviour (e.g. update
 the same ref as the source).

 Expecting a reroll.
 cf. <20200416152145.wp2zeibxmuyas6y6@feanor>


* pw/rebase-i-more-options (2020-04-29) 5 commits

 - doc: add documentation for the proc-receive hook
 - receive-pack: new config receive.procReceiveRefs
 - refs.c: refactor to reuse ref_is_hidden()
 - receive-pack: feed report options to post-receive
 - New capability "report-status-v2" for git-push
 - receive-pack: add new proc-receive hook
 - transport: not report a non-head push as a branch

 "git receive-pack" that accepts requests by "git push" learned to
 outsource most of the ref updates to the new "proc-receive" hook.

 Needs review.

 . ci: respect the [skip ci] convention in our GitHub workflow "CI/PR"

 Allow contributors to mark a branch/push that it does not have to
