What's cooking in git.git (May 2018, #04; Wed, 30)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

The recent fixes in v2.17.1 and downward have been merged to these
integration branches 'master' and above.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* ab/get-short-oid (2018-05-11) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-23 at 07e1908439)
 + get_short_oid: sort ambiguous objects by type, then SHA-1
 + sha1-name.c: move around the collect_ambiguous() function
 + git-p4: change "commitish" typo to "committish"
 + sha1-array.h: align function arguments
 + sha1-name.c: remove stray newline

 When a short hexadecimal string is used to name an object but there
 are multiple objects that share the string as the prefix of their
 names, the code lists these ambiguous candidates in a help message.
 These object names are now sorted according to their types for
 easier eyeballing.


* bc/object-id (2018-05-02) 42 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-23 at 916bcce829)
 + merge-one-file: compute empty blob object ID

 Conversion from uchar[20] to struct object_id continues.


* bp/merge-rename-config (2018-05-08) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-22 at 911440a742)
 + merge: pass aggressive when rename detection is turned off
 + merge: add merge.renames config setting
 + merge: update documentation for {merge,diff}.renameLimit
 (this branch is used by ma/unpack-trees-free-msgs.)

 With merge.renames configuration set to false, the recursive merge
 strategy can be told not to spend cycles trying to find renamed
 paths and merge them accordingly.


* bp/status-rename-config (2018-05-13) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-22 at ffcb0a7aa7)
 + add status config and command line options for rename detection

 "git status" learned to honor a new status.renames configuration to
 skip rename detection, which could be useful for those who want to
 do so without disabling the default rename detection done by the
 "git diff" command.


* cf/submodule-progress-dissociate (2018-05-22) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-22 at 9b3b96c54b)
 + submodule: add --dissociate option to add/update commands
 + submodule: add --progress option to add command
 + submodule: clean up substitutions in script

 "git submodule update" and "git submodule add" supported the
 "--reference" option to borrow objects from a neighbouring local
 repository like "git clone" does, but lacked the more recent
 invention "--dissociate".  Also "git submodule add" has been taught
 to take the "--progress" option.


* dd/send-email-reedit (2018-05-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-22 at 1f4c98324f)
 + git-send-email: allow re-editing of message

 "git send-email" can sometimes offer confirmation dialog "Send this
 email?" with choices 'Yes', 'No', 'Quit', and 'All'.  A new action
 'Edit' has been added to this dialog's choice.


* jk/unavailable-can-be-missing (2018-05-13) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-22 at 91980c5d1e)
 + mark_parents_uninteresting(): avoid most allocation
 + mark_parents_uninteresting(): replace list with stack
 + mark_parents_uninteresting(): drop missing object check
 + mark_tree_contents_uninteresting(): drop missing object check

 Code clean-up to turn history traversal more robust in a
 semi-corrupt repository.


* js/sequencer-and-root-commits (2018-05-06) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-22 at c1a62f5bc9)
 + rebase --rebase-merges: root commits can be cousins, too
 + rebase --rebase-merges: a "merge" into a new root is a fast-forward
 + sequencer: allow introducing new root commits
 + rebase -i --root: let the sequencer handle even the initial part
 + sequencer: learn about the special "fake root commit" handling
 + sequencer: extract helper to update active_cache_tree

 The implementation of "git rebase -i --root" has been updated to use
 the sequencer machinery more.


* js/use-bug-macro (2018-05-10) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-22 at fd848c39ae)
 + BUG_exit_code: fix sparse "symbol not declared" warning
 + Convert remaining die*(BUG) messages
 + Replace all die("BUG: ...") calls by BUG() ones
 + run-command: use BUG() to report bugs, not die()
 + test-tool: help verifying BUG() code paths

 Developer support update, by using BUG() macro instead of die() to
 mark codepaths that should not happen more clearly.
 Further updates can come on top later.
 cf. <20180507090109.GA367@sigill.intra.peff.net>


* jt/partial-clone-proto-v2 (2018-05-06) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-23 at f8b3692e8e)
 + {fetch,upload}-pack: support filter in protocol v2
 + upload-pack: read config when serving protocol v2
 + upload-pack: fix error message typo
 + Merge branch 'bw/protocol-v2' into jt/partial-clone-proto-v2

 Transfer protocol v2 learned to support the partial clone.


* lm/credential-netrc (2018-05-14) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-23 at c3a0417715)
 + git-credential-netrc: accept gpg option
 + git-credential-netrc: adapt to test framework for git

 Update credential-netrc helper (in contrib/) to allow customizing
 the GPG used to decrypt the encrypted .netrc file.


* ma/create-pseudoref-with-null-old-oid (2018-05-13) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-22 at c751a19b67)
 + refs: handle zero oid for pseudorefs
 + t1400: add tests around adding/deleting pseudorefs
 + refs.c: refer to "object ID", not "sha1", in error messages

 "git update-ref A B" is supposed to ensure that ref A does not yet
 exist when B is a NULL OID, but this check was not done correctly
 for pseudo-refs outside refs/ hierarchy, e.g. MERGE_HEAD.


* ma/lockfile-cleanup (2018-05-10) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-22 at e2efbf0b90)
 + lock_file: move static locks into functions
 + lock_file: make function-local locks non-static
 + refs.c: do not die if locking fails in `delete_pseudoref()`
 + refs.c: do not die if locking fails in `write_pseudoref()`
 + t/helper/test-write-cache: clean up lock-handling

 Code clean-up to adjust to a more recent lockfile API convention that
 allows lockfile instances kept on the stack.


* nd/pack-struct-commit (2018-05-13) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-22 at 38d8a651f0)
 + commit.h: rearrange 'index' to shrink struct commit

 Memory optimization.


* nd/repo-clear-keep-the-index (2018-05-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-22 at 398c7ac4e9)
 + repository: fix free problem with repo_clear(the_repository)

 the_repository->index is not a allocated piece of memory but
 repo_clear() indiscriminately attempted to free(3) it, which has
 been corrected.


* nd/travis-gcc-8 (2018-05-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-22 at d5d54efa72)
 + travis-ci: run gcc-8 on linux-gcc jobs

 Developer support.  Use newer GCC on one of the builds done at
 TravisCI.org to get more warnings and errors diagnosed.


* rs/no-null-ptr-arith-in-fast-export (2018-05-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-22 at db60f06bba)
 + fast-export: avoid NULL pointer arithmetic

 Code clean-up to avoid non-standard-conformant pointer arithmetic.


* sb/blame-color (2018-04-24) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-23 at 2e9c0daf0b)
 + builtin/blame: add new coloring scheme config
 + builtin/blame: highlight recently changed lines
 + builtin/blame: dim uninteresting metadata lines

 "git blame" learns to unhighlight uninteresting metadata from the
 originating commit on lines that are the same as the previous one,
 and also paint lines in different colors depending on the age of
 the commit.


* sb/submodule-update-try-harder (2018-05-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-23 at 698e6707d7)
 + git-submodule.sh: try harder to fetch a submodule

 "git submodule update" attempts two different kinds of "git fetch"
 against the upstream repository to grab a commit bound at the
 submodule's path, but it incorrectly gave up if the first kind
 (i.e. a normal fetch) failed, making the second "last resort" one
 (i.e. fetching an exact commit object by object name) ineffective.
 This has been corrected.


* sg/complete-paths (2018-05-21) 13 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-22 at a00b992aec)
 + t9902-completion: exercise __git_complete_index_file() directly
 + completion: don't return with error from __gitcomp_file_direct()
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-08 at 2a11444f90)
 + completion: fill COMPREPLY directly when completing paths
 + completion: improve handling quoted paths in 'git ls-files's output
 + completion: remove repeated dirnames with 'awk' during path completion
 + t9902-completion: ignore COMPREPLY element order in some tests
 + completion: use 'awk' to strip trailing path components
 + completion: let 'ls-files' and 'diff-index' filter matching paths
 + completion: improve handling quoted paths on the command line
 + completion: support completing non-ASCII pathnames
 + completion: simplify prefix path component handling during path completion
 + completion: move __git_complete_index_file() next to its helpers
 + t9902-completion: add tests demonstrating issues with quoted pathnames

 Command line completion (in contrib/) learned to complete pathnames
 for various commands better.


* sg/t6500-no-redirect-of-stdin (2018-05-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-22 at 7019b3a1d5)
 + t6050-replace: don't disable stdin for the whole test script

 Test cleanup.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* pa/import-tars-long-names (2018-05-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-30 at 5e043b2fca)
 + import-tars: read overlong names from pax extended header

 The import-tars script (in contrib/) has been taught to handle
 tarballs with overly long paths that use PAX extended headers.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* nd/use-opt-int-set-f (2018-05-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-30 at f8f5d612ed)

 Hotfixes.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jt/submodule-pull-recurse-rebase (2018-05-25) 1 commit
 - submodule: do not pass null OID to setup_revisions

 "git pull -recurse-submodules --rebase", when the submodule
 repository's history did not have anything common between ours and
 the upstream's, failed to execute.  We need to fetch from them to
 continue even in such a case.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ma/wrapped-info (2018-05-28) 2 commits
 - usage: prefix all lines in `vreportf()`, not just the first
 - usage: extract `prefix_suffix_lines()` from `advise()`

 An attempt to help making multi-line messages fed to warning(),
 error(), and friends more easily translatable.

 Wait for discussion to settle.
 cf. <20180529213957.GF7964@sigill.intra.peff.net>


* nd/complete-config-vars (2018-05-29) 13 commits
 - completion: complete general config vars in two steps
 - log-tree: allow to customize 'grafted' color
 - completion: support case-insensitive config vars
 - completion: keep other config var completion in camelCase
 - completion: drop the hard coded list of config vars

 - Merge branch 'nd/command-list' into nd/complete-config-vars
 (this branch uses nd/command-list.)

 Continuing with the idea to programatically enumerate various
 pieces of data required for command line completion, teach the
 codebase to report the list of configuration variables
 subcommands care about to help complete them.


* nd/completion-negation (2018-05-29) 3 commits
 - completion: collapse extra --no-.. options
 - completion: suppress some -no- options
 - parse-options: option to let --git-completion-helper show negative form

 Continuing with the idea to programatically enumerate various
 pieces of data required for command line completion, the codebase
 has been taught to enumerate options prefixed with "--no-" to
 negate them.


* rd/doc-options-placeholder (2018-05-25) 1 commit

* jh/json-writer (2018-03-28) 1 commit
 - json_writer: new routines to create data in JSON format

 Preparatory code to later add json output for unspecified telemetry
 data.

 We do not add random code that does not have real users to our
 codebase, so let's have it wait until such a real code materializes
 before too long.


* hn/bisect-first-parent (2018-04-21) 1 commit

 - SQUASH???
 - t5560-http-backend-noserver.sh: add CONTENT_LENGTH cases
 - SQUASH???
 - http-backend: respect CONTENT_LENGTH as specified by rfc3875

 The http-backend (used for smart-http transport) used to slurp the
 whole input until EOF, without paying attention to CONTENT_LENGTH
 that is supplied in the environment and instead expecting the Web
 server to close the input stream.  This has been fixed.

 Expecting a reroll.
 Suggested fixes to be used when rerolling is queued, but I'd
 prefer _not_ squashing them myself.

 Also, it may be too complex solution for the problem.

* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2017-08-10) 1 commit
 . zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

 Needs resurrecting by making sure the fix is good and still applies
 (or adjusted to today's codebase).

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* jm/cache-entry-from-mem-pool (2018-05-24) 7 commits
 - block alloc: add validations around cache_entry lifecyle
 - block alloc: allocate cache entries from mem_pool
 - mem-pool: fill out functionality
 - mem-pool: add lifecycle management functions
 - mem-pool: only search head block for available space
 - block alloc: add lifecycle APIs for cache_entry structs
 - read-cache: teach refresh_cache_entry() to take istate

 For a large tree, the index needs to hold many cache entries
 allocated on heap.  These cache entries are now allocated out of a
 dedicated memory pool to amortize malloc(3) overhead.

 Is this ready for 'next'?


* bw/ref-prefix-for-configured-refspec (2018-05-18) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-24 at a0d4af6180)
 + fetch: generate ref-prefixes when using a configured refspec
 + refspec: consolidate ref-prefix generation logic
 (this branch uses bw/refspec-api.)

 "git fetch $there $refspec" that talks over protocol v2 can take
 advantage of server-side ref filtering; the code has been extended
 so that this mechanism triggers also when fetching with configured
 refspec.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 Many tests hardcode the raw object names, which would change once
 we migrate away from SHA-1.  While some of them must test against
 exact object names, most of them do not have to use hardcoded
 constants in the test.  The latter kind of tests have been updated
 to test the moral equivalent of the original without hardcoding the
 actual object names.

  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-24 at bb5643d75c)

 The in-core "commit" object had an all-purpose "void *util" field,
 which was tricky to use especially in library-ish part of the
 code.  All of the existing uses of the field has been migrated to a
 more dedicated "commit-slab" mechanism and the field is eliminated.

* nd/diff-apply-ita (2018-05-29) 4 commits

 + t2203: add a test about "diff HEAD" case
 + diff: turn --ita-invisible-in-index on by default
 + diff: ignore --ita-[in]visible-in-index when diffing worktree-to-tree

 "git diff" compares the index and the working tree.  For paths
 added with intent-to-add bit, the command shows the full contents
 of them as added, but the paths themselves were not marked as new
 files.  They are now shown as new by default.

 "git apply" learned the "--intent-to-add" option so that an
 otherwise working-tree-only application of a patch will add new
 paths to the index marked with the "intent-to-add" bit.

 + merge-recursive: give notice when submodule commit gets fast-forwarded
 + merge-recursive: i18n submodule merge output and respect verbosity
 + submodule.c: move submodule merging to merge-recursive.c

 By code restructuring of submodule merge in merge-recursive,
 informational messages from the codepath are now given using the
 same mechanism as other output, and honor the merge.verbosity
 configuration.  The code also learned to give a few new messages
 when a submodule three-way merge resolves cleanly when one side
 records a descendant of the commit chosen by the other side.

 The "-l" option in "git branch -l" is an unfortunate short-hand for
 "--create-reflog", but many users, both old and new, somehow expect
 it to be something else, perhaps "--list".  This step deprecates
 the short-hand and warns about the future removal of the it when it
