What's cooking in git.git (Jul 2009, #03; Wed, 29)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones
marked with '.' do not appear in any of the branches, but I am still
holding onto them.

In preparation for rewinding 'next' after a major release, one topic was
reverted and kicked back to 'pu' to give it a fresh start.

After the 1.6.5 cycle, the next release will be 1.7.0, and we will push
out the planned "push safety" change.  1.7.0 would be a good time to
introduce "justifiable" changes that are not strictly backward compatible.

During 1.6.5 cycle, 'next' will hold topics meant for 1.6.5 and 1.7.0.
I've already merged the "diff --exit-code --ignore-whitespace" change and
"push safety" change.

I'll rewind 'next' sometime this weekend.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[In 'next']

* ne/futz-upload-pack (Wed Jun 10 01:50:18 2009 +0200) 1 commit
 + Shift object enumeration out of upload-pack

* js/run-command-updates (Sat Jul 4 21:26:43 2009 +0200) 6 commits
 + receive-pack: remove unnecessary run_status report
 + run_command: report failure to execute the program, but optionally
   don't
 + run_command: encode deadly signal number in the return value
 + run_command: report system call errors instead of returning error
   codes
 + run_command: return exit code as positive value
 + MinGW: simplify waitpid() emulation macros

* sb/maint-pull-rebase (Sun Jul 19 09:45:16 2009 +0200) 2 commits
 + pull: support rebased upstream + fetch + pull --rebase
 + t5520-pull: Test for rebased upstream + fetch + pull --rebase

* jc/1.7.0-diff-whitespace-only-status (Sat May 23 01:15:35 2009 -0700) 2 commits
 + diff: Rename QUIET internal option to QUICK
 + diff: change semantics of "ignore whitespace" options

This changes exit code from "git diff --ignore-whitespace" and friends
when there is no actual output.  It is a backward incompatible change, but
we could argue that it is a bugfix.

* jc/1.7.0-push-safety (Mon Feb 9 00:19:46 2009 -0800) 2 commits
 + Refuse deleting the current branch via push
 + Refuse updating the current branch in a non-bare repository via
   push

This is old 'jc/deny-delete-current-1.7.0' and 'jc/1.7.0-push-safety'
topics redone.

* sb/read-tree (Thu Jun 25 22:14:10 2009 -0700) 2 commits
 + read-tree: migrate to parse-options
 + read-tree: convert unhelpful usage()'s to helpful die()'s

* sb/parse-options (Tue Jul 7 22:15:41 2009 -0700) 4 commits
 + prune-packed: migrate to parse-options
 + verify-pack: migrate to parse-options
 + verify-tag: migrate to parse-options
 + write-tree: migrate to parse-options

Parse-options migration; should be in 'master' soonish.

* mk/grep-max-depth (Wed Jul 22 19:52:15 2009 +0200) 1 commit
 + grep: Add --max-depth option.

* cc/replace (Wed May 27 07:14:09 2009 +0200) 14 commits
 + t6050: check pushing something based on a replaced commit
 + Documentation: add documentation for "git replace"
 + Add git-replace to .gitignore
 + builtin-replace: use "usage_msg_opt" to give better error messages
 + parse-options: add new function "usage_msg_opt"
 + builtin-replace: teach "git replace" to actually replace
 + Add new "git replace" command
 + environment: add global variable to disable replacement
 + mktag: call "check_sha1_signature" with the replacement sha1
 + replace_object: add a test case
 + object: call "check_sha1_signature" with the replacement sha1
 + sha1_file: add a "read_sha1_file_repl" function
 + replace_object: add mechanism to replace objects found in
   "refs/replace/"
 + refs: add a "for_each_replace_ref" function

Does not seem to hurt normal operation without "replace".  The basic idea
should be easier and safer to use than the graft mechanism.  I haven't
tried the replacement myself, though.

* ns/init-mkdir (Sat Jul 25 06:59:28 2009 +0900) 1 commit
 + git init: optionally allow a directory argument

Straightforward usability change.  Should be in 'master' soonish.

* mk/init-db-parse-options (Sun Jul 12 12:24:32 2009 +0200) 1 commit
 + init-db: migrate to parse-options

* jk/maint-show-tag (Sat Jul 18 06:14:37 2009 -0400) 2 commits
 + show: add space between multiple items
 + show: suppress extra newline when showing annotated tag

* jc/apply-epoch-patch (Fri Jul 10 18:38:08 2009 -0700) 1 commit
 + apply: notice creation/removal patches produced by GNU diff

Better acceptance of some "GNU patch" output to create or remove files.
