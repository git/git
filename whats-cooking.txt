What's cooking in git.git (Jun 2025, #07; Fri, 20)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and
aren't considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL
to a message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity (of course they can be resubmit when new interests
arise).

A handful of topics that have been cooking in 'next' are now in
'master'.  I've rewound the tip of 'next' to prepare for this cycle.

As the project usually is slow during Summer in Northern hemisphere,
I plan to make the next cycle on the shorter side to last 8 weeks
(usually a typical release cycle lasts for 8 to 12 weeks).  Key
dates are:

 - Jun 23rd - the 2.51 cycle opens
 - Aug  4th - 2.51-rc0 (preview)
 - Aug  7th - 2.51-rc1 (master really freezes)
 - Aug 13th - 2.51-rc2
 - Aug 18th - 2.51-final

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-scm/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

Release tarballs are available at:

* jc/cocci-avoid-regexp-constraint (2025-06-18) 1 commit
 - cocci: matching (multiple) identifiers

 Avoid regexp_constraint and instead use comparison_constraint when

* jc/cocci-dtype (2025-06-18) 1 commit
 - cocci: do not directly access the .d_type member in struct dirent

 Catch direct access to .d_type member of struct dirent, as some
 non-POSIX compliant systems we support lack it, and rewrite to use
 DTYPE() macro, which is not quite the right thing to do.
