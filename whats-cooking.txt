What's cooking in git.git (Oct 2021, #06; Mon, 25)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen',
which means nothing more than that I have found them of interest for
some reason (like "it may have hard-to-resolve conflicts with
another topic already in flight" or "this may turn out to be
useful").  Do not read too much into a topic being in (or not in)
'seen'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of the
integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

The fifteenth batch of topics are in 'master'.  I expect that this
is more-or-less what we can expect in the -rc0, unless there is a
hotfix to what's already merged.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/

  (merged to 'next' on 2021-10-14 at 08c52f5cd5)

  (merged to 'next' on 2021-10-11 at 2f90c87850)

 Recent sparse-index addition, namely any use of index_name_pos(),

 cache-tree or existing index entries.  One such instance of such a
 breakage has been corrected.

* tb/fix-midx-rename-while-mapped (2021-10-15) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-10-18 at 52e552caae)
 + midx.c: guard against commit_lock_file() failures

 + midx.c: lookup MIDX by object directory during expire

 + Merge branch 'tb/repack-write-midx' into tb/fix-midx-rename-while-mapped

 The codepath to write a new version of .midx multi-pack index files
 has learned to release the mmaped memory holding the current
 version of .midx before removing them from the disk, as some
 platforms do not allow removal of a file that still has mapping.

 - pull: --ff-only should make it a noop when already-up-to-date

 "git pull --ff-only" and "git pull --rebase --ff-only" should make
 it a no-op to attempt pulling from a remote that is behind us, but
 instead the command errored out by saying it was impossible to
 fast-forward, which may technically be true, but not a useful thing
 to diagnose as an error.  This has been corrected.

* ab/ignore-replace-while-working-on-commit-graph (2021-10-15) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-10-25 at 5ed4266a96)
 + commit-graph: don't consider "replace" objects with "verify"
 + commit-graph tests: fix another graph_git_two_modes() helper
 + commit-graph tests: fix error-hiding graph_git_two_modes() helper
 (this branch is used by gc/use-repo-settings.)

 Teach "git commit-graph" command not to allow using replace objects
 at all, as we do not use the commit-graph at runtime when we see
 object replacement.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* so/stash-staged (2021-10-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-10-25 at 68b88e35c4)
 + stash: implement '--staged' option for 'push' and 'save'

 "git stash" learned the "--staged" option to stash away what has
 been added to the index (and nothing else).

 Will merge to 'master'.


* vd/sparse-sparsity-fix-on-read (2021-10-21) 3 commits
 - sparse-index: update do_read_index to ensure correct sparsity
 - sparse-index: add ensure_correct_sparsity function
 - test-read-cache.c: prepare_repo_settings after config init

 Ensure that the sparseness of the in-core index matches the
 index.sparse configuration specified by the repository immediately
 after the on-disk index file is read.


* jc/fix-ref-sorting-parse (2021-10-20) 2 commits
 - for-each-ref: delay parsing of --sort=<atom> options
 - Merge branch 'ab/ref-filter-leakfix' into jc/fix-ref-sorting-parse
 (this branch uses ab/ref-filter-leakfix.)

 Things like "git -c branch.sort=bogus branch new HEAD", i.e. the
 operation modes of the "git branch" command that do not need the
 sort key information, no longer errors out by seeing a bogus sort
 key.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jc/tutorial-format-patch-base (2021-10-23) 1 commit
 - MyFirstContribution: teach to use "format-patch --base=auto"

 Teach and encourage first-time contributors to this project to
 state the base commit when they submit their topic.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/http-push-status-fix (2021-10-18) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-10-23 at 9704ff261d)
 + transport-helper: recognize "expecting report" error from send-pack
 + send-pack: complain about "expecting report" with --helper-status

 "git push" client talking to an HTTP server did not diagnose the
 lack of the final status report from the other side correctly,
 which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* js/branch-track-inherit (2021-10-18) 1 commit
 - branch: add flags and config to inherit tracking

 "git -c branch.autosetupmerge=inherit branch new old" makes "new"
 to have the same upstream as the "old" branch, instead of marking
 "old" itself as its upstream.

 Under discussion.

* rb/doc-commit-header-continuation-line (2021-10-11) 1 commit
 - signature-format.txt: add space to fix gpgsig continuation line

 Values in the header portion of commit object can be multi-lined
 by a single SP indentation of the second and subsequent lines, and
 this applies to an empty line as well.  Update an example in the
 technical documentation to highlight it.

 Will discard.

 Superseded by the jc/doc-commit-header-continuation-line topic.

 (this branch uses vd/sparse-reset.)

 Teach diff and blame to work well with sparse index.


* mp/absorb-submodule-git-dir-upon-deinit (2021-10-07) 1 commit
 - submodule: absorb git dir instead of dying on deinit

 "git submodule deinit" for a submodule whose .git metadata
 directory is embedded in its working tree refused to work, until
 the submodule gets converted to use the "absorbed" form where the
 metadata directory is stored in superproject, and a gitfile at the
 top-level of the working tree of the submodule points at it.  The
 command is taught to convert such submodules to the absorbed form
 as needed.

 Under review.

* ns/remerge-diff (2021-10-08) 8 commits

 - merge-ort: capture and print ll-merge warnings in our preferred fashion
 - ll-merge: add API for capturing warnings in a strbuf instead of stderr
 - merge-ort: add ability to record conflict messages in a file
 - merge-ort: mark a few more conflict messages as omittable
 - Merge branch 'ns/tmp-objdir' into ns/remerge-diff
 (this branch uses ns/tmp-objdir.)

 A new presentation for two-parent merge "--remerge-diff" can be
 used to show the difference between mechanical (and possibly
 conflicted) merge results and the recorded resolution.

 On hold.
 This is Elijah's remerge-diff rebased on ns/tmp-objdir to share the
 "create objects temporarily, only to discard without committing
 them to longer-term storage" infrastructure with another topic.


* ns/tmp-objdir (2021-10-04) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-10-23 at 358d376f61)
 + tmp-objdir: disable ref updates when replacing the primary odb
 + tmp-objdir: new API for creating temporary writable databases
 (this branch is used by ns/batched-fsync and ns/remerge-diff.)

 New interface into the tmp-objdir API to help in-core use of the
 quarantine feature.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 better with the sparse index.

 Needs review.


* gc/use-repo-settings (2021-10-15) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-10-25 at 3d38c09a8d)
 + gc: perform incremental repack when implictly enabled

 + fsck: verify commit graph when implicitly enabled
 + Merge branch 'ab/ignore-replace-while-working-on-commit-graph' into gc/use-repo-settings
 (this branch uses ab/ignore-replace-while-working-on-commit-graph.)

 It is wrong to read some settings directly from the config
 subsystem, as things like feature.experimental can affect their
 default values.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 which codepaths the helper is used and to do what, and tests to
 protect the fixes.
