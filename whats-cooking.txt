What's cooking in git.git (Jan 2013, #01; Tue, 1)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.

The tip of the 'master' branch is at 1.8.1; the tip of 'next' will
be rewound soonish to reorder topics that are already well cooked
during the pre-release freeze earlier than the others so that they
can orderly be merged to 'master' after the dust settles, probably
towards the end of this week.

Note that many topics that have been marked as "Will cook in next"
have been recategorized to be merged to 'master' soonish, and a few
topics have been marked to be kicked back to 'pu'.  Please holler if
a topic that still has unresolved issues is marked to be merged to
'master' by mistake.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches of the
repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* jc/submittingpatches (2013-01-01) 3 commits
 - SubmittingPatches: remove overlong checklist
 - SubmittingPatches: mention subsystems with dedicated repositories
 - SubmittingPatches: who am I and who cares?

 Will reroll.


* kb/maint-bundle-doc (2013-01-01) 2 commits

 - branch: delete branch description if it's empty
 - format-patch: pick up branch description when no ref is specified
 - config.txt: a few lines about branch.<name>.description

 Waiting for a reroll.

* jl/submodule-deinit (2012-12-04) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-12-07 at ea772f0)
 + submodule: add 'deinit' command

 There was no Porcelain way to say "I no longer am interested in
 this submodule", once you express your interest in a submodule with
 "submodule init".  "submodule deinit" is the way to do so.

 But this does not yet do so (does not remove the checkout of the
 submodule).  The design discussion petered out.

 http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/210867/focus=211456

 Will kick back to 'pu'.


* jc/doc-maintainer (2012-11-27) 1 commit
 - update "howto maintain git"

 An early draft that is still incomplete.

 - remote-bzr: add support for pushing
 - Add new remote-bzr transport helper

 New remote helper for bzr (v3).  With minor fixes, this may be ready
 for 'next'.

 Needs review by folks interested in cvsserver.


* aw/rebase-am-failure-detection (2012-10-11) 1 commit
 - rebase: Handle cases where format-patch fails

 Save output from format-patch command in a temporary file, just in
 case it aborts, to give a better failure-case behaviour.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/lua-hackery (2012-10-07) 6 commits
 - pretty: fix up one-off format_commit_message calls
 - Minimum compilation fixup
 - Makefile: make "lua" a bit more configurable
 - add a "lua" pretty format
 - add basic lua infrastructure
 - pretty: make some commit-parsing helpers more public

 Interesting exercise. When we do this for real, we probably would want
 to wrap a commit to make it more like an "object" with methods like
 "parents", etc.


* fc/remote-testgit-feature-done (2012-10-29) 1 commit
 - remote-testgit: properly check for errors

 Needs review and Ack (or Nack) from people involved in the remote
 helper interface for this to move forward.


* rc/maint-complete-git-p4 (2012-09-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-10-29 at af52cef)
 + Teach git-completion about git p4

 Comment from Pete will need to be addressed in a follow-up patch.

 Will kick back to 'pu'.


* jc/maint-name-rev (2012-09-17) 7 commits
 - describe --contains: use "name-rev --algorithm=weight"
 - name-rev --algorithm=weight: tests and documentation
 - name-rev --algorithm=weight: cache the computed weight in notes
 - name-rev --algorithm=weight: trivial optimization
 - name-rev: --algorithm option
 - name_rev: clarify the logic to assign a new tip-name to a commit
 - name-rev: lose unnecessary typedef

 "git name-rev" names the given revision based on a ref that can be
 reached in the smallest number of steps from the rev, but that is
 not useful when the caller wants to know which tag is the oldest one
 that contains the rev.  This teaches a new mode to the command that
 uses the oldest ref among those which contain the rev.

 I am not sure if this is worth it; for one thing, even with the help
 from notes-cache, it seems to make the "describe --contains" even
 slower. Also the command will be unusably slow for a user who does
 not have a write access (hence unable to create or update the
 notes-cache).

 Stalled mostly due to lack of responses.


* jc/xprm-generation (2012-09-14) 1 commit
 - test-generation: compute generation numbers and clock skews

 A toy to analyze how bad the clock skews are in histories of real
 world projects.

 Stalled mostly due to lack of responses.


* jc/blame-no-follow (2012-09-21) 2 commits
 - blame: pay attention to --no-follow
 - diff: accept --no-follow option

 Teaches "--no-follow" option to "git blame" to disable its
 whole-file rename detection.

 Stalled mostly due to lack of responses.


* jc/doc-default-format (2012-11-26) 2 commits
 - [SQAUSH] allow "cd Doc* && make DEFAULT_DOC_TARGET=..."
 - Allow generating a non-default set of documentation

 Need to address the installation half if this is to be any useful.


* jc/add-delete-default (2012-08-13) 1 commit
 - git add: notice removal of tracked paths by default

 "git add dir/" updated modified files and added new files, but does
 not notice removed files, which may be "Huh?" to some users.  They
 can of course use "git add -A dir/", but why should they?

 Resurrected from graveyard, as I thought it was a worthwhile thing
 to do in the longer term.

 Waiting for comments.


* mb/remote-default-nn-origin (2012-07-11) 6 commits
 - Teach get_default_remote to respect remote.default.
 - Test that plain "git fetch" uses remote.default when on a detached HEAD.
 - Teach clone to set remote.default.
 - Teach "git remote" about remote.default.
 - Teach remote.c about the remote.default configuration setting.
 - Rename remote.c's default_remote_name static variables.

 When the user does not specify what remote to interact with, we
 often attempt to use 'origin'.  This can now be customized via a
 configuration variable.

 Expecting a reroll.

 "The first remote becomes the default" bit is better done as a
 separate step.

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

 Stop recommending a defunct third-party software.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* as/test-name-alias-uniquely (2012-12-28) 1 commit
 - Use longer alias names in subdirectory tests

 A few short-and-bland aliases used in the tests were interfering
 with git-custom command in user's $PATH.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jc/maint-fmt-merge-msg-no-edit-lose-credit (2012-12-28) 1 commit
 - merge --no-edit: do not credit people involved in the side branch

 Stop spending cycles to compute information to be placed on
 commented lines in "merge --no-edit".

 Will merge to 'next'.

 - dir.c: rename path_excluded() to is_path_excluded()
 - dir.c: rename cryptic 'which' variable to more consistent name
 - Improve documentation and comments regarding directory traversal API
 - api-directory-listing.txt: update to match code

 Rerolled.  The early parts looked mostly fine; we may want to split
 this into two topics and have the early half progress earlier.


* jc/format-patch-reroll (2012-12-22) 7 commits
 - format-patch: add --reroll-count=$N option
 - get_patch_filename(): split into two functions
 - get_patch_filename(): drop "just-numbers" hack
 - get_patch_filename(): simplify function signature
 - builtin/log.c: stop using global patch_suffix
 - builtin/log.c: drop redundant "numbered_files" parameter from make_cover_letter()
 - builtin/log.c: drop unused "numbered" parameter from make_cover_letter()

 Teach "format-patch" to prefix v4- to its output files for the
 fourth iteration of a patch series, to make it easier for the
 submitter to keep separate copies for iterations.

 Needs tests and documentation updates.


* ms/subtree-fixlets (2012-12-22) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-12-26 at 1cb26eb)
 + git-subtree: fix typo in manpage

 - wildmatch: make dowild() take arbitrary flags
 - wildmatch: rename constants and update prototype
 (this branch uses nd/wildmatch.)

 Replace our use of fnmatch(3) with a more feature-rich wildmatch.
 A handful patches at the bottom have been moved to nd/wildmatch to
 graduate as part of that branch, before this series solidifies.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 Will merge to 'master' in the first batch.


* os/gitweb-highlight-uncaptured (2013-01-01) 1 commit

 - merge-tree: fix d/f conflicts
 - merge-tree: add comments to clarify what these functions are doing
 - merge-tree: lose unused "resolve_directories"

 proof-of-concept code.


* mk/maint-graph-infinity-loop (2012-09-25) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-12-26 at 2ff59ab)
 + graph.c: infinite loop in git whatchanged --graph -m

 The --graph code fell into infinite loop when asked to do what the
 code did not expect ;-)

 Will merge to 'master' in the first batch.

  (merged to 'next' on 2012-12-22 at 18cdaf0)
 + xmkstemp(): avoid showing truncated template more carefully

 An earlier patch to save original arguments to mkstemp() away and
 use it to report what filename we failed to create incorrectly used
 the buffer munged by failing mkstemp().

 Will merge to 'master' in the first batch.

 Race-fix for pack-refs running in parallel to ref creation.

 Will merge to 'master' in the first batch.

 + Makefile: replace "echo 1>..." with "echo >..."
 + Makefile: detect when PYTHON_PATH changes

 rest of the system, so that the same SSH/GIT_ASKPASS can be used.

 Will merge to 'master' in the first batch.


* zk/clean-report-failure (2012-12-17) 1 commit
 - git-clean: Display more accurate delete messages

 "git clean" states what it is going to remove and then goes on to
 remove it, but sometimes it only discovers things that cannot be
 removed after recursing into a directory, which makes the output
 confusing and even wrong.

 Expecting a reroll.


* mp/complete-paths (2012-12-21) 1 commit
 - git-completion.bash: add support for path completion

 The completion script used to let the default completer to suggest
 pathnames, which gave too many irrelevant choices (e.g. "git add"
 would not want to add an unmodified path).  Teach it to use a more
 git-aware logic to enumerate only relevant ones.

 Waiting for area-experts' review.


* ja/directory-attrs (2012-12-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-12-17 at ced8e73)
 + Add directory pattern matching to attributes

 The attribute mechanism didn't allow limiting attributes to be
 applied to only a single directory itself with "path/" like the
 exclude mechanism does.

 Will merge to 'master' in the first batch.


* jk/mailmap-from-blob (2012-12-13) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-12-17 at 14b7cdc)

 like shortlog in server settings.

 Will merge to 'master' in the first batch.


* dm/port (2012-12-19) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-12-22 at 8adc198)
 + git-compat-util.h: do not #include <sys/param.h> by default
 + Generalize the inclusion of strings.h
 + Detect when the passwd struct is missing pw_gecos

 Complete "git commmit -c foo<TAB>" into a refname that begins with
 "foo".

 Will merge to 'master' in the first batch.


* jk/error-const-return (2012-12-15) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-12-22 at bf2b1cd)
 + silence some -Wuninitialized false positives
 + make error()'s constant return value more visible

 Help compilers' flow analysis by making it more explicit that
 error() always returns -1, to reduce false "variable used
 uninitialized" warnings.  Looks somewhat ugly but not too much.

 Will merge to 'master' in the first batch.


* mk/qnx (2012-12-19) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-12-22 at 0473197)

  (merged to 'next' on 2012-12-22 at 7312c6c)
 + tests: paint unexpectedly fixed known breakages in bold red
 + tests: test the test framework more thoroughly
 + tests: refactor mechanics of testing in a sub test-lib
 + tests: change info messages from yellow/brown to cyan
 + tests: paint skipped tests in blue
 + tests: paint known breakages in yellow
 + tests: test number comes first in 'not ok $count - $message'

 Various minor tweaks to the test framework to paint its output
 lines in colors that match what they mean better.

 Will merge to 'master' in the first batch.


* sp/shortlog-missing-lf (2012-12-11) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-12-11 at 64b8429)
 + strbuf_add_wrapped*(): Remove unused return value
 + shortlog: fix wrapping lines of wraplen

 When a line to be wrapped has a solid run of non space characters
 whose length exactly is the wrap width, "git shortlog -w" failed to
 add a newline after such a line.

 Will merge to 'master' in the first batch.


* ap/log-mailmap (2012-12-27) 10 commits
 - log --use-mailmap: optimize for cases without --author/--committer search
 - log: add log.mailmap configuration option
 - log: grep author/committer using mailmap
 - test: Add test for --use-mailmap option
 - log: Add --use-mailmap option
 - pretty: Use mailmap to display username and email

 - mailmap: Simplify map_user() interface
 - mailmap: Remove buffer length limit in map_user
 - Use split_ident_line to parse author and committer
 (this branch is used by jc/mailmap.)

 Clean up various codepaths around mailmap and teach the "log"
 machinery to use it.

 Waiting for further tweaks.

  (merged to 'next' on 2012-12-13 at 9f39410)
 + gitweb: Sort projects with undefined ages last

 Gitweb showed repositories without any commit at the top in its
 age-sorted view, in which the users are interested in looking at
 active projects; sorting them at the bottom makes it more useful.

 Will merge to 'master' in the first batch.

* nd/invalidate-i-t-a-cache-tree (2012-12-15) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-12-18 at 33e4488)
 + cache-tree: invalidate i-t-a paths after generating trees
 + cache-tree: fix writing cache-tree when CE_REMOVE is present
 + cache-tree: replace "for" loops in update_one with "while" loops
 + cache-tree: remove dead i-t-a code in verify_cache()

 Writing out a tree object when you still have intent-to-add entries
 in the index left an incorrect cache-tree data there.

* pf/editor-ignore-sigint (2012-12-02) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-12-07 at 6b04419)
 + launch_editor: propagate signals from editor to git
 + run-command: do not warn about child death from terminal
 + launch_editor: ignore terminal signals while editor has control
 + launch_editor: refactor to use start/finish_command
 + run-command: drop silent_exec_failure arg from wait_or_whine

 Avoid confusing cases where the user hits Ctrl-C while in the editor
 session, not realizing git will receive the signal. Since most editors
 will take over the terminal and will block SIGINT, this is not likely
 to confuse anyone.

  (merged to 'next' on 2012-11-28 at 43d51c2)
 + config: exit on error accessing any config file
 + doc: advertise GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM
 + config: treat user and xdg config permission problems as errors
 + config, gitignore: failure to access with ENOTDIR is ok

 Deal with a situation where .config/git is a file and we notice
 .config/git/config is not readable due to ENOTDIR, not ENOENT.

* mh/ceiling (2012-10-29) 8 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-11-26 at d1ce76a)
 + string_list_longest_prefix(): remove function
 + setup_git_directory_gently_1(): resolve symlinks in ceiling paths
 + longest_ancestor_length(): require prefix list entries to be normalized
 + longest_ancestor_length(): take a string_list argument for prefixes
 + longest_ancestor_length(): use string_list_split()
 + Introduce new function real_path_if_valid()
 + real_path_internal(): add comment explaining use of cwd
 + Introduce new static function real_path_internal()

 Elements of GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES list may not match the real
 pathname we obtain from getcwd(), leading the GIT_DIR discovery
 logic to escape the ceilings the user thought to have specified.

 Resurrected from Stalled; the earlier performance fear was
 unwarranted.

 + apply.c:update_pre_post_images(): the preimage can be truncated

 Fix to update_pre_post_images() that did not take into account the
 possibility that whitespace fix could shrink the preimage and
 change the number of lines in it.
