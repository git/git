What's cooking in git.git (Feb 2017, #01; Thu, 2)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

The tip of 'master' has most of the topics (and all the big ones)
that should be in the upcoming release.  I'll tag 2.12-rc0 sometime
tomorrow.  On the 'maint' front, Git 2.11.1 has been tagged with
bugfixes that are already in 'master'.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

* bc/use-asciidoctor-opt (2017-01-31) 8 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-01-31 at f2a641f6f3)
 + Documentation: implement linkgit macro for Asciidoctor
 + Makefile: add a knob to enable the use of Asciidoctor
 + Documentation: move dblatex arguments into variable
 + Documentation: add XSLT to fix DocBook for Texinfo
 + Documentation: sort sources for gitman.texi
 + Documentation: remove unneeded argument in cat-texi.perl
 + Documentation: modernize cat-texi.perl
 + Documentation: fix warning in cat-texi.perl

 Asciidoctor, an alternative reimplementation of AsciiDoc, still
 needs some changes to work with documents meant to be formatted
 with AsciiDoc.  "make USE_ASCIIDOCTOR=YesPlease" to use it out of
 the box to document our pages is getting closer to reality.


* cw/doc-sign-off (2017-01-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-01-31 at 133cc2886d)
 + doc: clarify distinction between sign-off and pgp-signing

 Doc update.


* ep/commit-static-buf-cleanup (2017-01-31) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-01-31 at 02d3c25219)
 + builtin/commit.c: switch to strbuf, instead of snprintf()
 + builtin/commit.c: remove the PATH_MAX limitation via dynamic allocation

 Code clean-up.


* gv/mingw-p4-mapuser (2017-01-30) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-01-31 at 5a9f2c96f6)
 + git-p4: fix git-p4.mapUser on Windows

 "git p4" did not work well with multiple git-p4.mapUser entries on
 Windows.


* hv/mingw-help-is-executable (2017-01-30) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-01-31 at 89aae8d018)
 + help: improve is_executable() on Windows

 "git help" enumerates executable files in $PATH; the implementation
 of "is this file executable?" on Windows has been optimized.


* js/mingw-hooks-with-exe-suffix (2017-01-30) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-01-31 at 3b7863c578)
 + mingw: allow hooks to be .exe files

 Names of the various hook scripts must be spelled exactly, but on
 Windows, an .exe binary must be named with .exe suffix; notice
 $GIT_DIR/hooks/<hookname>.exe as a valid <hookname> hook.


* js/retire-relink (2017-01-25) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-01-31 at c6c6f9b902)
 + relink: really remove the command
 + relink: retire the command

 Cruft removal.


* js/status-pre-rebase-i (2017-01-26) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-01-31 at 09e51b2e39)
 + status: be prepared for not-yet-started interactive rebase

 After starting "git rebase -i", which first opens the user's editor
 to edit the series of patches to apply, but before saving the
 contents of that file, "git status" failed to show the current
 state (i.e. you are in an interactive rebase session, but you have
 applied no steps yet) correctly.


* js/unzip-in-usr-bin-workaround (2017-01-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-01-31 at 515d1d1f90)
 + test-lib: on FreeBSD, look for unzip(1) in /usr/local/bin/

 Test tweak for FreeBSD where /usr/bin/unzip is unsuitable to run
 our tests but /usr/local/bin/unzip is usable.


* mm/reset-facl-before-umask-test (2017-01-30) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-01-31 at 4a2031e49c)
 + t0001: don't let a default ACL interfere with the umask test

 Test tweaks for those who have default ACL in their git source tree
 that interfere with the umask test.


* nd/log-graph-configurable-colors (2017-01-31) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-01-31 at 36df9e2376)
 + color_parse_mem: allow empty color spec
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-01-23 at c369982ad8)
 + log --graph: customize the graph lines with config log.graphColors
 + color.c: trim leading spaces in color_parse_mem()
 + color.c: fix color_parse_mem() with value_len == 0

 Some people feel the default set of colors used by "git log --graph"
 rather limiting.  A mechanism to customize the set of colors has
 been introduced.


* rs/absolute-pathdup (2017-01-27) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-01-31 at f751f64876)
 + use absolute_pathdup()
 + abspath: add absolute_pathdup()

 Code cleanup.


* rs/receive-pack-cleanup (2017-01-30) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-01-31 at d660881f69)
 + receive-pack: call string_list_clear() unconditionally

 Code clean-up.


* sb/submodule-add-force (2016-11-29) 1 commit
 + submodule add: extend force flag to add existing repos
 (this branch is used by sb/push-make-submodule-check-the-default.)

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2016-12-12

 "git submodule add" used to be confused and refused to add a
 locally created repository; users can now use "--force" option
 to add them.


* sg/mailmap-self (2017-01-31) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-01-31 at 2e7641759c)
 + .mailmap: update Gábor Szeder's email address

 Will merge to 'master'.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* ls/p4-path-encoding (2016-12-18) 1 commit
 - git-p4: fix git-p4.pathEncoding for removed files

 When "git p4" imports changelist that removes paths, it failed to
 convert pathnames when the p4 used encoding different from the one
 used on the Git side.  This has been corrected.

 Will be rerolled.

* sh/grep-tree-obj-tweak-output (2017-01-20) 2 commits
 - grep: use '/' delimiter for paths
 - grep: only add delimiter if there isn't one already

 "git grep", when fed a tree-ish as an input, shows each hit
 prefixed with "<tree-ish>:<path>:<lineno>:".  As <tree-ish> is
 almost always either a commit or a tag that points at a commit, the
 early part of the output "<tree-ish>:<path>" can be used as the
 name of the blob and given to "git show".  When <tree-ish> is a
 tree given in the extended SHA-1 syntax (e.g. "<commit>:", or
 "<commit>:<dir>"), however, this results in a string that does not
 name a blob (e.g. "<commit>::<path>" or "<commit>:<dir>:<path>").
 "git grep" has been taught to be a bit more intelligent about these
 cases and omit a colon (in the former case) or use slash (in the
 latter case) to produce "<commit>:<path>" and
 "<commit>:<dir>/<path>" that can be used as the name of a blob.

 Waiting for the review discussion to settle, followed by a reroll.


* mh/ref-remove-empty-directory (2017-01-07) 23 commits
 - files_transaction_commit(): clean up empty directories
 - try_remove_empty_parents(): teach to remove parents of reflogs, too
 - try_remove_empty_parents(): don't trash argument contents
 - try_remove_empty_parents(): rename parameter "name" -> "refname"
 - delete_ref_loose(): inline function
 - delete_ref_loose(): derive loose reference path from lock
 - log_ref_write_1(): inline function
 - log_ref_setup(): manage the name of the reflog file internally
 - log_ref_write_1(): don't depend on logfile argument
 - log_ref_setup(): pass the open file descriptor back to the caller
 - log_ref_setup(): improve robustness against races
 - log_ref_setup(): separate code for create vs non-create
 - log_ref_write(): inline function
 - rename_tmp_log(): improve error reporting
 - rename_tmp_log(): use raceproof_create_file()
 - lock_ref_sha1_basic(): use raceproof_create_file()
 - lock_ref_sha1_basic(): inline constant
 - raceproof_create_file(): new function
 - safe_create_leading_directories(): set errno on SCLD_EXISTS
 - safe_create_leading_directories_const(): preserve errno
 - t5505: use "for-each-ref" to test for the non-existence of references
 - refname_is_safe(): correct docstring
 - files_rename_ref(): tidy up whitespace

 Deletion of a branch "foo/bar" could remove .git/refs/heads/foo
 once there no longer is any other branch whose name begins with
 "foo/", but we didn't do so so far.  Now we do.

 Expecting a reroll.

* jc/diff-b-m (2015-02-23) 5 commits
 . WIPWIP
 . WIP: diff-b-m
 - diffcore-rename: allow easier debugging
 - diffcore-rename.c: add locate_rename_src()
 - diffcore-break: allow debugging

 "git diff -B -M" produced incorrect patch when the postimage of a
 completely rewritten file is similar to the preimage of a removed
 file; such a resulting file must not be expressed as a rename from
 other place.

 The fix in this patch is broken, unfortunately.

 Will discard.

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* jk/delta-chain-limit (2017-01-27) 2 commits
 - pack-objects: convert recursion to iteration in break_delta_chain()
 - pack-objects: enforce --depth limit in reused deltas

 "git repack --depth=<n>" for a long time busted the specified depth
 when reusing delta from existing packs.  This has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* js/re-running-failed-tests (2017-01-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-01-31 at 30c3a9e0cf)
 + t/Makefile: add a rule to re-run previously-failed tests

 "make -C t failed" will now run only the tests that failed in the
 previous run.  This is usable only when prove is not use, and gives
 a useless error message when run after "make clean", but otherwise
 is serviceable.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* cw/log-updates-for-all-refs-really (2017-02-01) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-02-02 at 3e11673fcc)
 + doc: add note about ignoring '--no-create-reflog'
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-01-31 at 53f71d2401)
 + update-ref: add test cases for bare repository
 + refs: add option core.logAllRefUpdates = always
 + config: add markup to core.logAllRefUpdates doc

 The "core.logAllRefUpdates" that used to be boolean has been
 enhanced to take 'always' as well, to record ref updates to refs
 other than the ones that are expected to be updated (i.e. branches,
 remote-tracking branches and notes).

 Will merge to 'master'.


* mm/merge-rename-delete-message (2017-01-30) 1 commit
 - merge-recursive: make "CONFLICT (rename/delete)" message show both paths


* rs/object-id (2017-01-30) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-01-31 at c442e4780c)
 + checkout: convert post_checkout_hook() to struct object_id
 + use oidcpy() for copying hashes between instances of struct object_id
 + use oid_to_hex_r() for converting struct object_id hashes to hex strings

 "uchar [40]" to "struct object_id" conversion continues.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* rs/swap (2017-01-30) 5 commits
 - graph: use SWAP macro
 - diff: use SWAP macro
 - use SWAP macro
 - apply: use SWAP macro
 - add SWAP macro

 Code clean-up.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* pl/complete-diff-submodule-diff (2017-01-30) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-01-31 at 7e668d325c)
 + Completion: Add support for --submodule=diff

 The command line completion (in contrib/) learned that
 "git diff --submodule=" can take "diff" as a recently added option.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ps/urlmatch-wildcard (2017-02-01) 5 commits
 - urlmatch: allow globbing for the URL host part
 - urlmatch: include host in urlmatch ranking
 - urlmatch: split host and port fields in `struct url_info`
 - urlmatch: enable normalization of URLs with globs
 - mailmap: add Patrick Steinhardt's work address

 The <url> part in "http.<url>.<variable>" configuration variable
 can now be spelled with '*' that serves as wildcard.
 E.g. "http.https://*.example.com.proxy" can be used to specify the
 proxy used for https://a.example.com, https://b.example.com, etc.,
 i.e. any host in the example.com domain.


* sb/submodule-recursive-absorb (2017-01-26) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-01-31 at 0a24cfd06b)
 + submodule absorbing: fix worktree/gitdir pointers recursively for non-moves
 + cache.h: expose the dying procedure for reading gitlinks
 + setup: add gentle version of resolve_git_dir

 When a submodule "sub", which has another submodule "module" nested
 within it, is "absorbed" into the top-level superproject, the inner
 submodule "module" is left in a strange state.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* sb/submodule-update-initial-runs-custom-script (2017-01-26) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-01-31 at d794f894c6)
 + submodule update: run custom update script for initial populating as well

 The user can specify a custom update method that is run when
 "submodule update" updates an already checked out submodule.  This
 was ignored when checking the submodule out for the first time and
 we instead always just checked out the commit that is bound to the
 path in the superproject's index.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* sf/putty-w-args (2017-02-01) 5 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - connect: Add the envvar GIT_SSH_VARIANT and ssh.variant config
 - git_connect(): factor out SSH variant handling
 - connect: rename tortoiseplink and putty variables
 - connect: handle putty/plink also in GIT_SSH_COMMAND

 The command line options for ssh invocation needs to be tweaked for
 some implementations of SSH (e.g. PuTTY plink wants "-P <port>"
 while OpenSSH wants "-p <port>" to specify port to connect to), and
 the variant was guessed when GIT_SSH environment variable is used
 to specify it.  Extend the guess to the command specified by the
 newer GIT_SSH_COMMAND and also core.sshcommand configuration
 variable, and give an escape hatch for users to deal with
 misdetected cases.

 Expecting a reroll of the last step to plug new memory leak.

* jk/describe-omit-some-refs (2017-01-23) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-01-23 at f8a14b4996)
 + describe: teach describe negative pattern matches
 + describe: teach --match to accept multiple patterns
 + name-rev: add support to exclude refs by pattern match
 + name-rev: extend --refs to accept multiple patterns
 + doc: add documentation for OPT_STRING_LIST

 "git describe" and "git name-rev" have been taught to take more
 than one refname patterns to restrict the set of refs to base their
 naming output on, and also learned to take negative patterns to
 name refs not to be used for naming via their "--exclude" option.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* sb/unpack-trees-super-prefix (2017-01-25) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-01-31 at dabe6ca2b1)
 + unpack-trees: support super-prefix option
 + t1001: modernize style
 + t1000: modernize style
 + read-tree: use OPT_BOOL instead of OPT_SET_INT

 "git read-tree" and its underlying unpack_trees() machinery learned
 to report problematic paths prefixed with the --super-prefix option.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* sb/submodule-doc (2017-01-12) 3 commits
 - submodules: add a background story
 - submodule update documentation: don't repeat ourselves

 - attr.c: update a stale comment on "struct match_attr"
 - attr.c: use strchrnul() to scan for one line
 - commit.c: use strchrnul() to scan for one line

 The gitattributes machinery is being taught to work better in a
 multi-threaded environment.

 Expecting a reroll.


* vn/xdiff-func-context (2017-01-15) 1 commit
 - xdiff -W: relax end-of-file function detection

 "git diff -W" has been taught to handle the case where a new
 function is added at the end of the file better.

 Will hold.
 An follow-up change to go back from the line that matches the
 funcline to show comments before the function definition is still
 being discussed.


* ls/filter-process-delayed (2017-01-08) 1 commit
 . convert: add "status=delayed" to filter process protocol

 Ejected, as does not build when merged to 'pu'.

 - worktree move: refuse to move worktrees with submodules
 - worktree move: accept destination as directory
 - worktree move: new command
 - worktree.c: add update_worktree_location()
 - worktree.c: add validate_worktree()

 "git worktree" learned move and remove subcommands.

 Needs review.

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2016-10-26

 This is the endgame of the topic to avoid blindly falling back to
 ".git" when the setup sequence said we are _not_ in Git repository.
 A corner case that happens to work right now may be broken by a
 call to die("BUG").

* jc/bundle (2016-03-03) 6 commits
 . index-pack: --clone-bundle option
 . Merge branch 'jc/index-pack' into jc/bundle
 . bundle v3: the beginning
 . bundle: keep a copy of bundle file name in the in-core bundle header
 . bundle: plug resource leak
 . bundle doc: 'verify' is not about verifying the bundle

 The beginning of "split bundle", which could be one of the
 ingredients to allow "git clone" traffic off of the core server
 network to CDN.

 While I think it would make it easier for people to experiment and
 build on if the topic is merged to 'next', I am at the same time a
 bit reluctant to merge an unproven new topic that introduces a new
 file format, which we may end up having to support til the end of
 time.  It is likely that to support a "prime clone from CDN", it
 would need a lot more than just "these are the heads and the pack
 data is over there", so this may not be sufficient.


* jk/nofollow-attr-ignore (2016-11-02) 5 commits
 . exclude: do not respect symlinks for in-tree .gitignore
 . attr: do not respect symlinks for in-tree .gitattributes
 . exclude: convert "check_index" into a flags field
 . attr: convert "macro_ok" into a flags field
 . add open_nofollow() helper

 As we do not follow symbolic links when reading control files like
 .gitignore and .gitattributes from the index, match the behaviour
 and not follow symbolic links when reading them from the working
 tree.  This also tightens security a bit by not leaking contents of
 an unrelated file in the error messages when it is pointed at by
 one of these files that is a symbolic link.

 Perhaps we want to cover .gitmodules too with the same mechanism?
