What's cooking in git.git (Jan 2019, #03; Fri, 18)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

* cy/completion-typofix (2019-01-03) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-08 at 6c6f01a07d)
 + completion: fix typo in git-completion.bash

 Typofix.


* cy/zsh-completion-SP-in-path (2019-01-03) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-08 at fee27de30b)
 + completion: treat results of git ls-tree as file paths
 + zsh: complete unquoted paths with spaces correctly

 With zsh, "git cmd path<TAB>" was completed to "git cmd path name"
 when the completed path has a special character like SP in it,
 without any attempt to keep "path name" a single filename.  This
 has been fixed to complete it to "git cmd path\ name" just like
 Bash completion does.


* ds/commit-graph-assert-missing-parents (2019-01-02) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-08 at d141f063e0)
 + commit-graph: writing missing parents is a BUG

 Tightening error checking in commit-graph writer.


* ds/gc-doc-typofix (2019-01-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-08 at f21ffc83e0)
 + git-gc.txt: fix typo about gc.writeCommitGraph

 Typofix.


* ed/simplify-setup-git-dir (2019-01-03) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-08 at 8722c7c2ef)
 + Simplify handling of setup_git_directory_gently() failure cases.

 Code simplification.


* en/show-ref-doc-fix (2019-01-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-14 at f875bfb9a4)
 + git-show-ref.txt: fix order of flags

 Doc update.


* es/doc-worktree-guessremote-config (2018-12-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-08 at f1dc5e39a6)
 + doc/config: do a better job of introducing 'worktree.guessRemote'

 Doc clarification.


* ew/ban-strncat (2019-01-02) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-08 at 3bba2ae2bb)
 + banned.h: mark strncat() as banned

 The "strncat()" function is now among the banned functions.


* jk/dev-build-format-security (2019-01-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-08 at 3761ab7026)
 + config.mak.dev: add -Wall, primarily for -Wformat, to help autoconf users

 Earlier we added "-Wformat-security" to developer builds, assuming
 that "-Wall" (which includes "-Wformat" which in turn is required
 to use "-Wformat-security") is always in effect.  This is not true
 when config.mak.autogen is in use, unfortunately.  This has been
 fixed by unconditionally adding "-Wall" to developer builds.


* jn/stripspace-wo-repository (2018-12-26) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-08 at 81815821c9)
 + stripspace: allow -s/-c outside git repository

 "git stripspace" should be usable outside a git repository, but
 under the "-s" or "-c" mode, it didn't.


* js/gc-repack-close-before-remove (2019-01-11) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-14 at 9daedfee40)
 + gc/repack: release packs when needed

 "git gc" and "git repack" did not close the open packfiles that
 they found unneeded before removing them, which didn't work on a
 platform incapable of removing an open file.  This has been
 corrected.


* la/quiltimport-keep-non-patch (2019-01-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-08 at 37cb490792)
 + git-quiltimport: add --keep-non-patch option

 "git quiltimport" learned "--keep-non-patch" option.


* ma/asciidoctor (2018-12-26) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-08 at 3cfd4ad6cb)
 + git-status.txt: render tables correctly under Asciidoctor
 + Documentation: do not nest open blocks
 + git-column.txt: fix section header

 Some of the documentation pages formatted incorrectly with
 Asciidoctor, which have been fixed.


* mm/multimail-1.5 (2019-01-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-08 at 8c872af48e)
 + git-multimail: update to release 1.5.0

 Update "git multimail" from the upstream.


* nd/style-opening-brace (2018-12-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-08 at 80de026e14)
 + style: the opening '{' of a function is in a separate line

 Code clean-up.


* nd/worktree-remove-with-uninitialized-submodules (2019-01-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-08 at e19cfe8741)
 + worktree: allow to (re)move worktrees with uninitialized submodules

 "git worktree remove" and "git worktree move" refused to work when
 there is a submodule involved.  This has been loosened to ignore
 uninitialized submodules.


* ot/ref-filter-object-info (2019-01-10) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-10 at 9e740568ce)
 + ref-filter: give uintmax_t to format with %PRIuMAX
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-08 at 0a4d4ed36a)
 + ref-filter: add docs for new options
 + ref-filter: add tests for deltabase
 + ref-filter: add deltabase option
 + ref-filter: add tests for objectsize:disk
 + ref-filter: add check for negative file size
 + ref-filter: add objectsize:disk option

 The "--format=<placeholder>" option of for-each-ref, branch and tag
 learned to show a few more traits of objects that can be learned by
 the object_info API.


* po/git-p4-wo-login (2019-01-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-08 at a7cc58d6b9)
 + git-p4: fix problem when p4 login is not necessary

 "git p4" update.


* rb/hpe (2019-01-03) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-08 at 52d6995399)
 + compat/regex/regcomp.c: define intptr_t and uintptr_t on NonStop
 + git-compat-util.h: add FLOSS headers for HPE NonStop
 + config.mak.uname: support for modern HPE NonStop config.
 + transport-helper: drop read/write errno checks
 + transport-helper: use xread instead of read

 Portability updates for the HPE NonStop platform.


* rs/loose-object-cache-perffix (2019-01-08) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-08 at 36e355e099)
 + object-store: retire odb_load_loose_cache()
 + object-store: use one oid_array per subdirectory for loose cache
 + object-store: factor out odb_clear_loose_cache()
 + object-store: factor out odb_loose_cache()
 (this branch is used by jk/loose-object-cache-oid.)

 The loose object cache used to optimize existence look-up has been
 updated.


* rs/sha1-file-close-mapped-file-on-error (2019-01-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-08 at 5841cbc153)
 + sha1-file: close fd of empty file in map_sha1_file_1()

 Code clean-up.


* sb/submodule-fetchjobs-default-to-one (2018-12-14) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-08 at 97a522ef5e)
 + submodule update: run at most one fetch job unless otherwise set

 "git submodule update" ought to use a single job unless asked, but
 by mistake used multiple jobs, which has been fixed.


* sb/submodule-unset-core-worktree-when-worktree-is-lost (2018-12-26) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-08 at 38f3175a2b)
 + submodule deinit: unset core.worktree
 + submodule--helper: fix BUG message in ensure_core_worktree
 + submodule: unset core.worktree if no working tree is present
 + submodule update: add regression test with old style setups

 The core.worktree setting in a submodule repository should not be
 pointing at a directory when the submodule loses its working tree
 (e.g. getting deinit'ed), but the code did not properly maintain
 this invariant.


* sg/stress-test (2019-01-07) 8 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-08 at 2a65cea5f9)
 + test-lib: add the '--stress' option to run a test repeatedly under load
 + test-lib-functions: introduce the 'test_set_port' helper function
 + test-lib: set $TRASH_DIRECTORY earlier
 + test-lib: consolidate naming of test-results paths
 + test-lib: parse command line options earlier
 + test-lib: parse options in a for loop to keep $@ intact
 + test-lib: extract Bash version check for '-x' tracing
 + test-lib: translate SIGTERM and SIGHUP to an exit
 (this branch uses sg/test-bash-version-fix.)

 Flaky tests can now be repeatedly run under load with the
 "--stress" option.


* sg/test-bash-version-fix (2019-01-03) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-08 at f83a0628a0)
 + Merge branch 'sg/test-bash-version-fix'
 + test-lib: check Bash version for '-x' without using shell arrays
 (this branch is used by sg/stress-test.)

 The test suite tried to see if it is run under bash, but the check
 itself failed under some other implementations of shell (notably
 under NetBSD).  This has been corrected.


* so/cherry-pick-always-allow-m1 (2019-01-07) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-08 at 2b790fec25)
 + t3506: validate '-m 1 -ff' is now accepted for non-merge commits
 + t3502: validate '-m 1' argument is now accepted for non-merge commits
 + cherry-pick: do not error on non-merge commits when '-m 1' is specified
 + t3510: stop using '-m 1' to force failure mid-sequence of cherry-picks

 "git cherry-pick -m1" was forbidden when picking a non-merge
 commit, even though there _is_ parent number 1 for such a commit.
 This was done to avoid mistakes back when "cherry-pick" was about
 picking a single commit, but is no longer useful with "cherry-pick"
 that can pick a range of commits.  Now the "-m$num" option is
 allowed when picking any commit, as long as $num names an existing
 parent of the commit.

 Technically this is a backward incompatible change; hopefully
 nobody is relying on the error-checking behaviour.


* tg/t5570-drop-racy-test (2019-01-07) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-08 at 9fc753bbdc)
 + Revert "t/lib-git-daemon: record daemon log"
 + t5570: drop racy test

 An inherently racy test that caused intermittent failures has been
 removed.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* ab/commit-graph-write-optim (2019-01-17) 1 commit
 - commit-graph write: use pack order when finding commits
 (this branch uses ab/commit-graph-write-progress.)

 The codepath to write out commit-graph has been optimized by
 following the usual pattern of visiting objects in in-pack order.

 This is taken hostage of the other topic; it may be slightly better
 if the dependency were the other way around, to allow this to
 graduate faster without waiting for the other.

 Needs sign-off.


* ab/commit-graph-write-progress (2019-01-17) 9 commits
 - commit-graph write: emit a percentage for all progress
 - commit-graph write: add itermediate progress
 - commit-graph write: remove empty line for readability
 - commit-graph write: add more descriptive progress output
 - commit-graph write: show progress for object search
 - commit-graph write: more descriptive "writing out" output
 - commit-graph write: add "Writing out" progress output
 - commit-graph: don't call write_graph_chunk_large_edges() unnecessarily
 - commit-graph: rename 'num_extra_edges' variable to 'num_large_edges'
 (this branch is used by ab/commit-graph-write-optim.)

 The codepath to show progress meter while writing out commit-graph
 file has been improved.

 Proposed updates for the bottom two have been raised.

* cc/test-ref-store-typofix (2019-01-17) 1 commit
 - helper/test-ref-store: fix "new-sha1" vs "old-sha1" typo

 An obvious typo in an assersion error message has been fixed.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/add-ignore-errors-bit-assignment-fix (2019-01-17) 1 commit
 - add: use separate ADD_CACHE_RENORMALIZE flag

 "git add --ignore-errors" did not work as advertised and instead
 worked as an unintended synonym for "git add --renormalize", which
 has been fixed.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* js/mingw-unc-path-w-backslashes (2019-01-18) 2 commits
 - mingw: special-case arguments to `sh`
 - mingw (t5580): document bug when cloning from backslashed UNC paths

 In Git for Windows, "git clone \\server\share\path" etc. that uses
 UNC paths from command line had bad interaction with its shell
 emulation.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* js/t6042-timing-fix (2019-01-17) 1 commit
 - t6042: work around speed optimization on Windows

 Test update.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jt/namespaced-ls-refs-fix (2019-01-18) 1 commit
 - ls-refs: filter refs using namespace-stripped name

 Fix namespace support in protocol v2.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* bp/checkout-new-branch-optim (2019-01-18) 2 commits
 - checkout: fix regression in checkout -b on intitial checkout
 - checkout: add test to demonstrate regression with checkout -b on initial commit

 "git checkout -b <new> [HEAD]" to create a new branch from the
 current commit and check it out ought to be a no-op in the index
 and the working tree in normal cases, but there are corner cases
 that does require updates to the index and the working tree.
 Running it immediately after "git clone --no-checkout" is one of
 these cases that an earlier optimization kicked in incorrectly,
 which has been fixed.

 Seems to break an existing test...


* br/blame-ignore (2019-01-18) 3 commits
 - blame: add a config option to mark ignored lines
 - blame: add the ability to ignore commits and their changes
 - Move init_skiplist() outside of fsck

 "git blame" learned to "ignore" commits in the history, whose
 effects (as well as their presence) get ignored.


* js/abspath-part-inside-repo (2019-01-18) 1 commit
 - abspath_part_inside_repo: respect core.ignoreCase

 On a case-insensntive filesystem, we failed to compare the part of
 the path that is above the worktree directory in an absolute
 pathname, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* nd/diff-parseopt (2019-01-18) 77 commits
 - SQUASH???

 - parse-options: disable option abbreviation with PARSE_OPT_KEEP_UNKNOWN
 - parse-options: allow keep-unknown + stop-at-non-opt combination
 - parse-options: add one-shot mode
 - parse-options.h: remove extern on function prototypes

 The diff machinery, one of the oldest parts of the system, which
 long predates the parse-options API, uses fairly long and complex
 handcrafted option parser.  This has been rewritten to use the
 parse-options API.

* js/filter-options-should-use-plain-int (2019-01-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-18 at 6714547e6d)
 + filter-options: expand scaled numbers
 (this branch uses md/list-objects-filter-by-depth and sb/more-repo-in-api; is tangled with jt/get-reference-with-commit-graph.)

 Update the protocol message specification to allow only the limited
 use of scaled quantities.  This is ensure potential compatibility
 issues will not go out of hand.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jt/upload-pack-deepen-relative-proto-v2 (2019-01-10) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-18 at 1483ad21db)

 + merge-recursive: copy $GITHEAD strings
 + init: make a copy of $GIT_DIR string
 + config: make a copy of $GIT_CONFIG string
 + commit: copy saved getenv() result
 + get_super_prefix(): copy getenv() result

 There were many places the code relied on the string returned from
 getenv() to be non-volatile, which is not true, that have been
 corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jt/fetch-v2-sideband (2019-01-17) 5 commits
 - tests: define GIT_TEST_SIDEBAND_ALL
 - {fetch,upload}-pack: sideband v2 fetch response
 - sideband: reverse its dependency on pkt-line
 - pkt-line: introduce struct packet_writer
 - Merge branch 'ms/packet-err-check' into jt/fetch-v2-sideband

 "git fetch" and "git upload-pack" learned to send all exchange over
 the sideband channel while talking the v2 protocol.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* kg/external-diff-save-env (2019-01-11) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-14 at 8281bbd48b)
 + diff: ensure correct lifetime of external_diff_cmd

 The code to drive GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF command relied on the string
 returned from getenv() to be non-volatile, which is not true, that
 has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 - read-cache.c: replace update_index_if_able with repo_&
 - read-cache.c: kill read_index()
 - checkout: avoid the_index when possible
 - repository.c: replace hold_locked_index() with repo_hold_locked_index()
 - notes-utils.c: remove the_repository references
 - grep: use grep_opt->repo instead of explict repo argument

 The assumption to work on the single "in-core index" instance has
 been reduced from the library-ish part of the codebase.

 This obviously has fallouts with a few topics in flight, but
 otherwise it seemed to be in good enough shape.

  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-18 at 60c38b9e4a)
 + cache: make oidcpy always copy GIT_MAX_RAWSZ bytes
 + tree-walk: store object_id in a separate member
 + match-trees: use hashcpy to splice trees
 + match-trees: compute buffer offset correctly when splicing
 + tree-walk: copy object ID before use

 The code to walk tree objects has been taught that we may be
 working with object names that are not computed with SHA-1.

 "git add -e" got confused when the change it wants to let the user
 edit is smaller than the previous change that was left over in a
 temporary file.

* js/rebase-am (2019-01-18) 4 commits
 - built-in rebase: call `git am` directly
 - rebase: teach `reset_head()` to optionally skip the worktree
 - rebase: avoid double reflog entry when switching branches
 - rebase: move `reset_head()` into a better spot

 Instead of going through "git-rebase--am" scriptlet to use the "am"
 backend, the built-in version of "git rebase" learned to drive the
 "am" backend directly.

 Waiting for a review response.
 Looked almost ready.


* ms/packet-err-check (2019-01-02) 2 commits
 - pack-protocol.txt: accept error packets in any context
 - Use packet_reader instead of packet_read_line
 (this branch is used by jt/fetch-v2-sideband.)

 Error checking of data sent over the pack-protocol has been
 revamped so that error packets are always diagnosed properly.

 + rebase: run post-checkout hook on checkout
 + t5403: simplify by using a single repository

 "git rebase" internally runs "checkout" to switch between branches,
 and the command used to call the post-checkout hook, but the
 reimplementation stopped doing so, which is getting fixed.

 Code clean-up.

 Later parts of the series crash heavily with sb/more-repo-in-api
 and are left out for now.  I am not sure if keeping that other
 topic is worth keeping to block the clean-up value of this topic
 which is probably more clear.


* lt/date-human (2019-01-18) 5 commits
 - Add `human` date format tests.
 - Add `human` format to test-tool
 - Add 'human' date format documentation
 - Remove the proposed use of auto as secondary way to specify human
 - Add 'human' date format

 A new date format "--date=human" that morphs its output depending
 on how far the time is from the current time has been introduced.
 "--date=auto" can be used to use this new format when the output is
 goint to the pager or to the terminal and otherwise the default
 format.

 The design around "auto" may need to be rethought.
 The tests need to be updated, too.

 - pack-objects: create GIT_TEST_PACK_SPARSE
 - pack-objects: create pack.useSparse setting
 - revision: implement sparse algorithm
 - list-objects: consume sparse tree walk
 - revision: add mark_tree_uninteresting_sparse

 "git pack-objects" learned another algorithm to compute the set of
 objects to send, that trades the resulting packfile off to save
 traversal cost to favor small pushes.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* js/rebase-i-redo-exec (2018-12-11) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-18 at 71be3fedb7)
 + rebase: introduce a shortcut for --reschedule-failed-exec
 + rebase: add a config option to default to --reschedule-failed-exec
 + rebase: introduce --reschedule-failed-exec

 "git rebase -i" learned to re-execute a command given with 'exec'
 to run after it failed the last time.

* md/list-objects-filter-by-depth (2019-01-15) 4 commits
 + tree:<depth>: skip some trees even when collecting omits

 + Merge branch 'nd/the-index' into md/list-objects-filter-by-depth
 + Merge branch 'sb/more-repo-in-api' into md/list-objects-filter-by-depth
 (this branch is used by js/filter-options-should-use-plain-int; uses sb/more-repo-in-api; is tangled with jt/get-reference-with-commit-graph.)

 The objects-filter machinery learned "tree:<depth>" to filter
 objects up to a given depth; earlier it only supported depth=0,
 i.e. usable to create a commit-only lazy clone.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 + entry: support CE_WT_REMOVE flag in checkout_entry
 + entry: factor out unlink_entry function
 + move worktree tests to t24*

 "git checkout --no-overlay" can be used to trigger a new mode of
 checking out paths out of the tree-ish, that allows paths that
 match the pathspec that are in the current index and working tree
 and are not in the tree-ish.

 The v2 upload-pack protocol implementation failed to honor
 hidden-ref configuration, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.
 An earlier attempt reverted out of 'next'.

 - Makefile: correct example fuzz build
 - commit-graph: fix buffer read-overflow
 - commit-graph, fuzz: add fuzzer for commit-graph

 The codepath to read from the commit-graph file attempted to read
 past the end of it when the file's table-of-contents was corrupt.

 + revision: use commit graph in get_reference()
 (this branch uses sb/more-repo-in-api; is tangled with js/filter-options-should-use-plain-int and md/list-objects-filter-by-depth.)

 Micro-optimize the code that prepares commit objects to be walked
 by "git rev-list" when the commit-graph is available.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* dl/merge-cleanup-scissors-fix (2018-11-21) 2 commits
 - merge: add scissors line on merge conflict
 - t7600: clean up 'merge --squash c3 with c7' test

 The list of conflicted paths shown in the editor while concluding a
 conflicted merge was shown above the scissors line when the
 clean-up mode is set to "scissors", even though it was commented
 out just like the list of updated paths and other information to
 help the user explain the merge better.

* aw/pretty-trailers (2018-12-09) 7 commits
 - pretty: add support for separator option in %(trailers)
 - strbuf: separate callback for strbuf_expand:ing literals
 - pretty: add support for "valueonly" option in %(trailers)
 - pretty: allow showing specific trailers
 - pretty: single return path in %(trailers) handling
 - pretty: allow %(trailers) options with explicit value
 - doc: group pretty-format.txt placeholders descriptions

 The %(trailers) formatter in "git log --format=..."  now allows to
 optionally pick trailers selectively by keyword, show only values,
 etc.

 How's the doneness of this one?


* jn/unknown-index-extensions (2018-11-21) 2 commits
 - index: offer advice for unknown index extensions
 - index: do not warn about unrecognized extensions

 A bit too alarming warning given when unknown index extensions
 exist is getting revamped.

 Expecting a reroll.

 "git rebase --merge" as been reimplemented by reusing the internal
 machinery used for "git rebase -i".

 On hold.

* dl/remote-save-to-push (2018-12-11) 1 commit
 - remote: add --save-to-push option to git remote set-url

 "git remote set-url" learned a new option that moves existing value
 of the URL field to pushURL field of the remote before replacing
 the URL field with a new value.

 I am personally not yet quite convinced if this is worth pursuing.


* js/protocol-advertise-multi (2018-12-28) 1 commit
 - protocol: advertise multiple supported versions

 The transport layer has been updated so that the protocol version
 used can be negotiated between the parties, by the initiator
 listing the protocol versions it is willing to talk, and the other
 side choosing from one of them.

 - remote-curl: die on server-side errors
 - remote-curl: tighten "version 2" check for smart-http
 - remote-curl: refactor smart-http discovery

 Some errors from the other side coming over smart HTTP transport
 were not noticed, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* nb/branch-show-other-worktrees-head (2019-01-15) 3 commits
 - branch: add an extra verbose output displaying worktree path for checked out branch
 - branch: mark and color a branch that is checked out in a linked worktree differently
 - ref-filter: add worktreepath atom

 "git branch --list" learned to show branches that are checked out
 in other worktrees connected to the same repository prefixed with
 '+', similar to the way the currently checked out branch is shown
 with '*' in front.

 The second one is of dubious value.  The third one requires extra
 "-v" to trigger extra information, but a new feature that improves
 human-readable Porcelain output, it probably shouldn't.  Needs
 sign-off.

 . ci/lib.sh: encapsulate Travis-specific things
 . ci: rename the library of common functions

 Prepare to run test suite on Azure DevOps.

 Ejected out of 'pu', as doing so seems to help other topics get
 tested at TravisCI.

 https://travis-ci.org/git/git/builds/452713184 is a sample of a
 build whose tests on 4 hang (with this series in).  Ejecting it
 gave us https://travis-ci.org/git/git/builds/452778963 which still
 shows breakages from other topics not yet in 'next', but at least
 the tests do not stall.


* du/branch-show-current (2018-10-26) 1 commit

* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2018-10-15) 1 commit

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".


* ag/sequencer-reduce-rewriting-todo (2019-01-14) 18 commits
 - rebase-interactive.h: fix hdr-check warnings

 - sequencer: refactor check_todo_list() to work on a todo_list
 - sequencer: introduce todo_list_write_to_file()
 - sequencer: refactor transform_todos() to work on a todo_list
 - sequencer: remove the 'arg' field from todo_item
 - sequencer: make the todo_list structure public
 - sequencer: changes in parse_insn_buffer()

 The scripted version of "git rebase -i" wrote and rewrote the todo
 list many times during a single step of its operation, and the
 recent C-rewrite made a faithful conversion of the logic to C.  The
 implementation has been updated to carry necessary information
 around in-core to avoid rewriting the same file over and over
 unnecessarily.

 May need a further update, including squashing the tip commit to a
 releavant place.

 - add -p: optimize line selection for short hunks
 - add -p: allow line selection to be inverted
 - add -p: select modified lines correctly
 - add -p: select individual hunk lines

 "git add -p" interactive interface learned to let users choose

 No further feedbacks on the topic for quite some time.

 I found the feature to be hard to explain, and may result in more
 end-user complaints, but let's see.
