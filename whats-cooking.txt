What's cooking in git.git (May 2014, #04; Wed, 21)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.

The tip of the 'master' branch has past v2.0.0-rc4, as there were
last minute regressions to be taken care of.  Hopefully we can tag
v2.0.0 final soonish.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* tr/merge-recursive-index-only (2014-02-05) 3 commits
 - merge-recursive: -Xindex-only to leave worktree unchanged
 - merge-recursive: internal flag to avoid touching the worktree
 - merge-recursive: remove dead conditional in update_stages()
 (this branch is used by tr/remerge-diff.)

 Will hold.


* tr/remerge-diff (2014-02-26) 5 commits
 . log --remerge-diff: show what the conflict resolution changed
 . name-hash: allow dir hashing even when !ignore_case
 . merge-recursive: allow storing conflict hunks in index
 . revision: fold all merge diff variants into an enum merge_diff_mode
 . combine-diff: do not pass revs->dense_combined_merges redundantly
 (this branch uses tr/merge-recursive-index-only.)

 "log -p" output learns a new way to let users inspect a merge
 commit by showing the differences between the automerged result
 with conflicts the person who recorded the merge would have seen
 and the final conflict resolution that was recorded in the merge.

 Needs to be rebased, now kb/fast-hashmap topic is in.


* jk/makefile (2014-02-05) 16 commits
 . FIXUP
 . move LESS/LV pager environment to Makefile
 . Makefile: teach scripts to include make variables
 . FIXUP
 . Makefile: auto-build C strings from make variables
 . Makefile: drop *_SQ variables
 . FIXUP
 . Makefile: add c-quote helper function
 . Makefile: introduce sq function for shell-quoting
 . Makefile: always create files via make-var
 . Makefile: store GIT-* sentinel files in MAKE/
 . Makefile: prefer printf to echo for GIT-*
 . Makefile: use tempfile/mv strategy for GIT-*
 . Makefile: introduce make-var helper function
 . Makefile: fix git-instaweb dependency on gitweb
 . Makefile: drop USE_GETTEXT_SCHEME from GIT-CFLAGS

 Simplify the Makefile rules and macros that exist primarily for
 quoting purposes, and make it easier to robustly express the
 dependency rules.

 Expecting a reroll.


* po/everyday-doc (2014-01-27) 1 commit
 - Make 'git help everyday' work

 This may make the said command to emit something, but the source is
 not meant to be formatted into a manual pages to begin with, and
 also its contents are a bit stale.  It may be a good first step in
 the right direction, but needs more work to at least get the
 mark-up right before public consumption.

 Will hold.


* jk/branch-at-publish-rebased (2014-01-17) 5 commits
 . t1507 (rev-parse-upstream): fix typo in test title
 . implement @{publish} shorthand
 . branch_get: provide per-branch pushremote pointers
 . branch_get: return early on error
 . sha1_name: refactor upstream_mark

 Give an easier access to the tracking branches from "other" side in
 a triangular workflow by introducing B@{publish} that works in a
 similar way to how B@{upstream} does.

 Meant to be used as a basis for whatever Ram wants to build on.

 Ejected from 'pu' to unclutter.


* fc/publish-vs-upstream (2014-04-21) 8 commits
 . sha1_name: add support for @{publish} marks
 . sha1_name: simplify track finding
 . sha1_name: cleanup interpret_branch_name()
 . branch: display publish branch
 . push: add --set-publish option
 . branch: add --set-publish-to option
 . Add concept of 'publish' branch
 . t5516 (fetch-push): fix test restoration

 Add branch@{publish}; it seems that this is somewhat different from
 Ram and Peff started working on.  At least the tip needs to be
 rerolled not to squat on @{p} which @{push} and possibly @{pull}
 may want to share.

 Ejected from 'pu' to unclutter.


* rb/merge-prepare-commit-msg-hook (2014-01-10) 4 commits
 - merge: drop unused arg from abort_commit method signature
 - merge: make prepare_to_commit responsible for write_merge_state
 - t7505: ensure cleanup after hook blocks merge
 - t7505: add missing &&

 Expose more merge states (e.g. $GIT_DIR/MERGE_MODE) to hooks that
 run during "git merge".  The log message stresses too much on one
 hook, prepare-commit-msg, but it would equally apply to other hooks
 like post-merge, I think.

 Waiting for a reroll.


* jl/submodule-recursive-checkout (2013-12-26) 5 commits
 - Teach checkout to recursively checkout submodules
 - submodule: teach unpack_trees() to update submodules
 - submodule: teach unpack_trees() to repopulate submodules
 - submodule: teach unpack_trees() to remove submodule contents
 - submodule: prepare for recursive checkout of submodules

 An RFCv2 exists ($gmane/241455) with sizable review comments.
 Expecting a reroll.


* jc/graph-post-root-gap (2013-12-30) 3 commits
 - WIP: document what we want at the end
 - graph: remove unused code a bit
 - graph: stuff the current commit into graph->columns[]

 This was primarily a RFH ($gmane/239580).


* np/pack-v4 (2013-09-18) 90 commits
 . packv4-parse.c: add tree offset caching
 . t1050: replace one instance of show-index with verify-pack
 . index-pack, pack-objects: allow creating .idx v2 with .pack v4
 . unpack-objects: decode v4 trees
 . unpack-objects: allow to save processed bytes to a buffer
 - ...

 Nico and Duy advancing the eternal vaporware pack-v4.  This is here
 primarily for wider distribution of the preview edition.

 Needs to be rebased, now the pack-bitmap series is in.


* tg/perf-lib-test-perf-cleanup (2013-09-19) 2 commits
 - perf-lib: add test_perf_cleanup target
 - perf-lib: split starting the test from the execution

 Add test_perf_cleanup shell function to the perf suite, that allows
 the script writers to define a test with a clean-up action.

 Will hold.


* jc/show-branch (2014-03-24) 5 commits
 - show-branch: use commit slab to represent bitflags of arbitrary width
 - show-branch.c: remove "all_mask"
 - show-branch.c: abstract out "flags" operation
 - show-branch.c: lift all_mask/all_revs to a global static
 - show-branch.c: update comment style

 Waiting for the final step to lift the hard-limit before sending it out.

* tb/unicode-6.3-zero-width (2014-05-12) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-05-14 at 08e0171)
 + utf8: make it easier to auto-update git_wcwidth()
 + utf8.c: use a table for double_width

 Update the logic to compute the display width needed for utf8
 strings and allow us to more easily maintain the tables used in
 that logic.

 We may want to let the users choose if codepoints with ambiguous
 widths are treated as a double or single width in a follow-up patch.

 Will keep in 'next' for the remainder of the cycle.

 The original 16 MiB limit for the in-core delta-base-cache
 introduced in 18bdec11 (Limit the size of the new delta_base_cache,
 2007-03-19) is turning too small.

* fc/merge-default-to-upstream (2014-04-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-04-22 at 4f98483)
 + merge: enable defaulttoupstream by default

 "git merge" without argument, even when there is an upstream
 defined for the current branch, refused to run until
 merge.defaultToUpstream is set to true. Flip the default of that
 configuration variable to true.

  (merged to 'next' on 2014-05-02 at a554691)
 + mergetool: document the default for --[no-]prompt
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-04-22 at dcaec94)
 + mergetool: run prompt only if guessed tool

 mergetool.prompt used to default to 'true', always causing a confirmation
 "do you really want to run the tool on this path" to be shown.

 Among the two purposes the prompt serves, ignore the use case to
 confirm that the user wants to view particular path with the named
 tool, and make the prompt only to confirm the choice of the tool
 made by autodetection and defaulting.  For those who configured the
 tool explicitly, the prompt shown for the latter purpose is simply
 annoying.

 Strictly speaking, this is a backward incompatible change and the
 users need to explicitly set the variable to 'true' if they want to
 resurrect the now-ignored use case.

 pread() emulation.

* ym/fix-opportunistic-index-update-race (2014-04-10) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-04-16 at cb92f4f)
 + read-cache.c: verify index file before we opportunistically update it
 + wrapper.c: add xpread() similar to xread()

 Read-only operations such as "git status" that internally refreshes
 the index write out the refreshed index to the disk to optimize
 future accesses to the working tree, but this could race with a
 "read-write" operation that modify the index while it is running.
 Detect such a race and avoid overwriting the index.

 Duy raised a good point that we may need to do the same for the
 normal writeout codepath, not just the "opportunistic" update
 codepath.  While that is true, nobody sane would be running two
 simultaneous operations that are clearly write-oriented competing
 with each other against the same index file.  So in that sense that
 can be done as a less urgent follow-up for this topic.

* jc/apply-ignore-whitespace (2014-03-26) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-04-04 at 53779a7)
 + apply --ignore-space-change: lines with and without leading whitespaces do not match

 "--ignore-space-change" option of "git apply" ignored the
 spaces at the beginning of line too aggressively, which is
 inconsistent with the option of the same name "diff" and "git diff"
 have.

  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-28 at 810a076)

 Add a configuration variable to force --full-name to be default for
 "git grep".

 This may cause regressions on scripted users that do not expect
 this new behaviour.

 + tree-diff: reuse base str(buf) memory on sub-tree recursion
 + tree-diff: no need to call "full" diff_tree_sha1 from show_path()
 + tree-diff: rework diff_tree interface to be sha1 based
 + tree-diff: diff_tree() should now be static
 + tree-diff: remove special-case diff-emitting code for empty-tree cases
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-25 at cfcbdac)
 + tree-diff: simplify tree_entry_pathcmp
 + tree-diff: show_path prototype is not needed anymore
 + tree-diff: rename compare_tree_entry -> tree_entry_pathcmp
 + tree-diff: move all action-taking code out of compare_tree_entry()
 + tree-diff: don't assume compare_tree_entry() returns -1,0,1
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-21 at d872679)
 + tree-diff: consolidate code for emitting diffs and recursion in one place
 + tree-diff: show_tree() is not needed
 + tree-diff: no need to pass match to skip_uninteresting()
 + tree-diff: no need to manually verify that there is no mode change for a path
 + combine-diff: move changed-paths scanning logic into its own function
 + combine-diff: move show_log_first logic/action out of paths scanning

 Instead of running N pair-wise diff-trees when inspecting a
 N-parent merge, find the set of paths that were touched by walking
 N+1 trees in parallel.  These set of paths can then be turned into
 N pair-wise diff-tree results to be processed through rename
 detections and such.  And N=2 case nicely degenerates to the usual
 2-way diff-tree, which is very nice.

 A new option to send a single patch to the standard output to be
