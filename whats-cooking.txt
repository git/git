What's cooking in git.git (Oct 2019, #06; Thu, 24)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

The first release candidate has been tagged on the 'master' front.
We probably would want to include ds/commit-graph-on-fetch fixup
(which is not in 'next' yet) in the upcoming release, but other than
that, this should be very close to the final one, I hope ;-)

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

 + commit: give correct advice for empty commit during a rebase
 + sequencer: export the function to get the path of `.git/rebase-merge/`
 + cherry-pick: add test for `--skip` advice in `git commit`

 The logic used in "git commit" to give hints and errors depending
 on what operation was in progress learned to distinguish rebase and
 cherry-pick better.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* sg/dir-trie-fixes (2019-10-23) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-10-24 at 06d60a7fb0)

 - rebase: add --reset-author-date
 - rebase -i: support --ignore-date
 - sequencer: rename amend_author to author_to_rename
 - rebase -i: support --committer-date-is-author-date
 - sequencer: allow callers of read_author_script() to ignore fields
 - rebase -i: add --ignore-whitespace flag

 "git rebase -i" learned a few options that are known by "git
 rebase" proper.

 Needs to consider existing GIT_COMMITTER_DATE environment, etc.
 cf. <5adde732-173b-d24d-d23f-bb4d043076d7@gmail.com>


* vn/reset-deleted-ita (2019-07-26) 1 commit
 - reset: unstage empty deleted ita files

 "git reset HEAD [<pathspec>]" did not reset an empty file that was
 added with the intent-to-add bit.

 Expecting a reroll.


* jn/unknown-index-extensions (2018-11-21) 2 commits
 - index: offer advice for unknown index extensions
 - index: do not warn about unrecognized extensions

 A bit too alarming warning given when unknown index extensions
 exist is getting revamped.

 Expecting a reroll.


* jc/format-patch-delay-message-id (2019-04-05) 1 commit
 - format-patch: move message-id and related headers to the end

 The location "git format-patch --thread" adds the Message-Id:
 header in the series of header fields has been moved down, which
 may help working around a suspected bug in GMail MSA, reported at
 <CAHk-=whP1stFZNAaJiMi5eZ9rj0MRt20Y_yHVczZPH+O01d+sA@mail.gmail.com>

 Waiting for feedback to see if it truly helps.
 Needs tests.


* js/protocol-advertise-multi (2018-12-28) 1 commit
 - protocol: advertise multiple supported versions

 The transport layer has been updated so that the protocol version
 used can be negotiated between the parties, by the initiator
 listing the protocol versions it is willing to talk, and the other
 side choosing from one of them.

 Expecting a reroll.
 cf. <CANq=j3u-zdb_FvNJGPCmygNMScseav63GhVvBX3NcVS4f7TejA@mail.gmail.com>


* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2018-10-15) 1 commit
 - zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

* dd/notes-copy-default-dst-to-head (2019-10-18) 2 commits

 + notes: fix minimum number of parameters to "copy" subcommand
 + t3301: test diagnose messages for too few/many paramters

 "git notes copy $original" ought to copy the notes attached to the
 original object to HEAD, but a mistaken tightening to command line
 parameter validation made earlier disabled that feature by mistake.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* jc/log-graph-simplify (2019-10-16) 13 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-10-24 at 190b88709e)

 + graph: reuse `find_new_column_by_commit()`
 + graph: handle line padding in `graph_next_line()`
 + graph: automatically track display width of graph lines

 The implementation of "git log --graph" got refactored and then its
 output got simplified.

 Will cook in 'next'.

  (merged to 'next' on 2019-10-24 at 3a7533c171)
 + git_path(): handle `.lock` files correctly
 + t1400: wrap setup code in test case

 "git rev-parse --git-path HEAD.lock" did not give the right path
 when run in a secondary worktree.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* pw/post-commit-from-sequencer (2019-10-16) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-10-18 at 15b41a097d)

 + move run_commit_hook() to libgit and use it there
 + sequencer.h fix placement of #endif
 + t3404: remove uneeded calls to set_fake_editor

 "rebase -i" ceased to run post-commit hook by mistake in an earlier
 update, which has been corrected.

 Will cook in 'next'.

 Management of sparsely checked-out working tree has gained a
 dedicated "sparse-checkout" command.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* dl/format-patch-cover-from-desc (2019-10-16) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-10-18 at 40e992b6f5)
 + format-patch: teach --cover-from-description option
 + format-patch: use enum variables
 + format-patch: replace erroneous and condition

 The branch description ("git branch --edit-description") has been
 used to fill the body of the cover letters by the format-patch
 command; this has been enhanced so that the subject can also be
 filled.

 Will cook in 'next'.
 No need for rush, as this is a new feature.

 + t604[236]: do not run setup in separate tests
 + merge-recursive: fix merging a subdirectory into the root directory
 + merge-recursive: clean up get_renamed_dir_portion()

 When all files from some subdirectory were renamed to the root
 directory, the directory rename heuristics would fail to detect that
 as a rename/merge of the subdirectory to the root directory, which has
 been corrected.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* jt/fetch-pack-record-refs-in-the-dot-promisor (2019-10-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-10-18 at 4ead52e59a)

 + sequencer: update `total_nr' when adding an item to a todo list

 Reduce unnecessary reading of state variables back from the disk
 during sequener operation.

 Will cook in 'next'.
 No need for rush, as this does not fix anything nor adds any new feature.


* mt/threaded-grep-in-object-store (2019-10-02) 11 commits
 - grep: move driver pre-load out of critical section
 - grep: re-enable threads in non-worktree case

 - grep: fix racy calls in grep_objects()
 - grep: fix race conditions at grep_submodule()
 - grep: fix race conditions on userdiff calls

 Traditionally, we avoided threaded grep while searching in objects
 (as opposed to files in the working tree) as accesses to the object
 layer is not thread-safe.  This limitation is getting lifted.


* jk/packfile-reuse-cleanup (2019-10-23) 9 commits
 - pack-objects: improve partial packfile reuse
 - builtin/pack-objects: introduce obj_is_packed()
 - pack-objects: introduce pack.allowPackReuse

 The way "git pack-objects" reuses objects stored in existing pack
 to generate its result has been improved.


* js/builtin-add-i (2019-08-30) 11 commits
 . built-in add -i: implement the `help` command
 . built-in add -i: use color in the main loop
 . built-in add -i: support `?` (prompt help)

 The beginning of rewriting "git add -i" in C.

 Expecting a reroll on top of a base with the tg/stash-refresh-index
 topic that defines an updated repo_refresh_and_write_index() helper.
