What's cooking in git.git (Sep 2018, #05; Mon, 24)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

The tip of 'master' has been updated with about 20 topics, the tip
of 'next' has been rewound, and 'maint' now prepares for Git 2.19.x
maintenance track.  A few topics have been kicked out of 'next' to
'pu' to be replaced with a newer iterations.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

 When fsmonitor is in use, after operation on submodules updates
 .gitmodules, we lost track of the fact that we did so and relied on
 stale fsmonitor data.

 Recent update broke the reachability algorithm when refs (e.g.
 tags) that point at objects that are not commit were involved,
 which has been fixed.
 Hotfix for a topic already in 'master'.

 + sequencer: fix --allow-empty-message behavior, make it smarter

 "git rebase" etc. in Git 2.19 fails to abort when given an empty
 commit log message as result of editing, which has been corrected.

 + rebase -i --autosquash: demonstrate a problem skipping the last squash

 "git rebase -i" did not clear the state files correctly when a run
 of "squash/fixup" is aborted and then the user manually amended the
 commit instead, which has been corrected.


* jt/lazy-object-fetch-fix (2018-09-13) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-09-17 at 321602b284)

 - git-column.1: clarify initial description, provide examples
 - git-archimport.1: specify what kind of Arch we're talking about

 Doc updates.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 - tests: don't swallow Git errors upstream of pipes
 - t/*: fix ordering of expected/observed arguments
 - tests: standardize pipe placement
 - CodingGuidelines: add shell piping guidelines

 Various test scripts have been updated for style and also correct
 handling of exit status of various commands.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* nd/complete-fetch-multiple-args (2018-09-21) 1 commit
 - completion: support "git fetch --multiple"

 Teach bash completion that "git fetch --multiple" only takes remote
 names as arguments and no refspecs.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jt/fetch-tips-in-partial-clone (2018-09-21) 2 commits
 - fetch: in partial clone, check presence of targets
 - connected: document connectivity in partial clones

 "git fetch $repo $object" in a partial clone did not correctly
 fetch the asked-for object that is referenced by an object in
 promisor packfile, which has been fixed.


* tg/t5551-with-curl-7.61.1 (2018-09-24) 2 commits
 - t5551: compare sorted cookies files
 - t5551: move setup code inside test_expect blocks

 Test update.

 Will merge to 'next'.
 Supersedes tz/t5551-with-curl-7.61.1 topic

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* bw/submodule-name-to-dir (2018-08-10) 2 commits
 - submodule: munge paths to submodule git directories
 - submodule: create helper to build paths to submodule gitdirs

 In modern repository layout, the real body of a cloned submodule
 repository is held in .git/modules/ of the superproject, indexed by
 the submodule name.  URLencode the submodule name before computing
 the name of the directory to make sure they form a flat namespace.

 Kicked back to 'pu', expecting further work on the topic.
 cf. <CAGZ79kYnbjaPoWdda0SM_-_X77mVyYC7JO61OV8nm2yj3Q1OvQ@mail.gmail.com>


* ng/status-i-short-for-ignored (2018-08-09) 1 commit
 - status: -i shorthand for --ignored command line option

 "git status --ignored" gained a shorthand "git status -i".

 Will discard, after hearing no strong support.
 What's the list opinion on this one?  It is Meh to me, but
 obviously the author cared enough to write a patch, so...


* sb/submodule-move-head-with-corruption (2018-08-28) 2 commits
 - submodule.c: warn about missing submodule git directories
 - t2013: add test for missing but active submodule

 Will discard and wait for a cleaned-up rewrite.
 cf. <20180907195349.GA103699@aiede.svl.corp.google.com>


* sl/commit-dry-run-with-short-output-fix (2018-07-30) 4 commits
 . commit: fix exit code when doing a dry run
 . wt-status: teach wt_status_collect about merges in progress
 . wt-status: rename commitable to committable
 . t7501: add coverage for flags which imply dry runs

 "git commit --dry-run" gave a correct exit status even during a
 conflict resolution toward a merge, but it did not with the
 "--short" option, which has been corrected.

 Seems to break 7512, 3404 and 7060 in 'pu'.


* ma/wrapped-info (2018-05-28) 2 commits
 - usage: prefix all lines in `vreportf()`, not just the first
 - usage: extract `prefix_suffix_lines()` from `advise()`

 An attempt to help making multi-line messages fed to warning(),
 error(), and friends more easily translatable.

 Will discard and wait for a cleaned-up rewrite.
 cf. <20180529213957.GF7964@sigill.intra.peff.net>


* hn/bisect-first-parent (2018-04-21) 1 commit
 - bisect: create 'bisect_flags' parameter in find_bisection()
 (this branch is used by tb/bisect-first-parent.)

 Preliminary code update to allow passing more flags down the
 bisection codepath in the future.

 We do not add random code that does not have real users to our
 codebase, so let's have it wait until such a real code materializes
 before too long.


* pb/bisect-helper-2 (2018-07-23) 8 commits
 - t6030: make various test to pass GETTEXT_POISON tests
 - bisect--helper: `bisect_start` shell function partially in C

 - bisect--helper: `bisect_next_check` shell function in C
 - bisect--helper: `check_and_set_terms` shell function in C
 - wrapper: move is_empty_file() and rename it as is_empty_or_missing_file()
 - bisect--helper: `bisect_write` shell function in C
 - bisect--helper: `bisect_reset` shell function in C

 Expecting a reroll.

 I just rebased the topic to a newer base as it did not build
 standalone with the base I originally queued the topic on, but
 otherwise there is no update to address any of the review comments
 in the thread above---we are still waiting for a reroll.


* jk/drop-ancient-curl (2017-08-09) 5 commits

 Some code in http.c that has bitrot is being removed.

 Expecting a reroll.


* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2017-08-10) 1 commit
 . zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

 Needs resurrecting by making sure the fix is good and still applies
 (or adjusted to today's codebase).

 "git commit --dry-run".

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jc/wt-status-state-cleanup (2018-09-07) 1 commit
 - WIP: roll wt_status_state into wt_status and populate in the collect phase
 (this branch uses ss/wt-status-committable.)


* ds/format-commit-graph-docs (2018-08-21) 2 commits
 - commit-graph.txt: improve formatting for asciidoc
 - Docs: Add commit-graph tech docs to Makefile

 Design docs for the commit-graph machinery is now made into HTML as
 well as text.

 Will discard.
 I am inclined to drop these, as I do not see much clarity in HTML
 output over the text source.  Opinions?


* js/rebase-in-c-5.5-work-with-rebase-i-in-c (2018-09-06) 2 commits
 - builtin rebase: prepare for builtin rebase -i
 - Merge branch 'ag/rebase-i-in-c' into js/rebase-in-c-5.5-work-with-rebase-i-in-c
 (this branch is used by pk/rebase-in-c-6-final; uses ag/rebase-i-in-c, pk/rebase-in-c, pk/rebase-in-c-2-basic, pk/rebase-in-c-3-acts, pk/rebase-in-c-4-opts and pk/rebase-in-c-5-test.)

 "rebase" that has been rewritten learns the new calling convention
 used by "rebase -i" that was rewritten in C, tying the loose end
 between two GSoC topics that stomped on each other's toes.


* js/add-i-coalesce-after-editing-hunk (2018-08-28) 1 commit
 - add -p: coalesce hunks before testing applicability

 Applicability check after a patch is edited in a "git add -i/p"
 session has been improved.

 Will hold.

* ao/submodule-wo-gitmodules-checked-out (2018-09-17) 9 commits
 - submodule: support reading .gitmodules when it's not in the working tree
 - submodule: add a helper to check if it is safe to write to .gitmodules
 - t7506: clean up .gitmodules properly before setting up new scenario

 - t7411: merge tests 5 and 6
 - submodule: factor out a config_set_in_gitmodules_file_gently function
 - submodule: add a print_config_from_gitmodules() helper

 The submodule support has been updated to read from the blob at
 HEAD:.gitmodules when the .gitmodules file is missing from the
 working tree.

 Object-store access needs to be protected from multi-threading.

 The "rev-list --filter" feature learned to exclude all trees via
 "tree:0" filter.

 Ejected from 'next' to be replaced with newer version.

* pw/add-p-select (2018-07-26) 4 commits
 - add -p: optimize line selection for short hunks
 - add -p: allow line selection to be inverted
 - add -p: select modified lines correctly
 - add -p: select individual hunk lines

 "git add -p" interactive interface learned to let users choose
 individual added/removed lines to be used in the operation, instead
 of accepting or rejecting a whole hunk.

 Will hold.
 cf. <d622a95b-7302-43d4-4ec9-b2cf3388c653@talktalk.net>
 I found the feature to be hard to explain, and may result in more
 end-user complaints, but let's see.


* ds/commit-graph-with-grafts (2018-08-21) 8 commits
 - commit-graph: close_commit_graph before shallow walk
 - commit-graph: not compatible with uninitialized repo
 - commit-graph: not compatible with grafts
 - commit-graph: not compatible with replace objects
 - test-repository: properly init repo
 - commit-graph: update design document
 - refs.c: upgrade for_each_replace_ref to be a each_repo_ref_fn callback
 - refs.c: migrate internal ref iteration to pass thru repository argument

 The recently introduced commit-graph auxiliary data is incompatible
 with mechanisms such as replace & grafts that "breaks" immutable
 nature of the object reference relationship.  Disable optimizations
 based on its use (and updating existing commit-graph) when these
 incompatible features are in use in the repository.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jn/gc-auto (2018-07-17) 1 commit
 - gc: do not return error for prior errors in daemonized mode
 (this branch uses jn/gc-auto-prep.)

 "gc --auto" ended up calling exit(-1) upon error, which has been
 corrected to use exit(1).  Also the error reporting behaviour when
 daemonized has been updated to exit with zero status when stopping
 due to a previously discovered error (which implies there is no
 point running gc to improve the situation); we used to exit with
 failure in such a case.

 Rewrite of the remaining "rebase -i" machinery in C.


* lt/date-human (2018-07-09) 1 commit
 - Add 'human' date format

 A new date format "--date=human" that morphs its output depending
 on how far the time is from the current time has been introduced.
 "--date=auto" can be used to use this new format when the output is
 goint to the pager or to the terminal and otherwise the default
 format.
