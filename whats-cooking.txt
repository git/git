What's cooking in git.git (Oct 2011, #03; Fri, 7)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.

The first wave of topics have been graduated to 'master'.  I've rebuilt
'next' while kicking some topics back to 'pu'. Also some topics have been
discarded.

Here are the repositories that have my integration branches:

With maint, master, next, pu, todo, html and man:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git
	https://code.google.com/p/git-core/
	https://github.com/git/git

With only maint, master, html and man:

	git://git.sourceforge.jp/gitroot/git-core/git.git
	git://git-core.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/git-core/git-core

With all the topics and integration branches but not todo, html or man:

	https://github.com/gitster/git

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* jc/signed-commit (2011-10-05) 4 commits
 - commit: teach --gpg-sign option
 - Split GPG interface into its own helper library
 - rename "match_refs()" to "match_push_refs()"
 - send-pack: typofix error message
 (this branch is tangled with jc/signed-push and jc/signed-push-3.)

This is to replace the earlier "signed push" experiments.

* js/maint-merge-one-file-osx-expr (2011-10-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-10-07 at fbb28a2)
 + merge-one-file: fix "expr: non-numeric argument"

Will merge to 'master' in the third wave.

* tm/completion-commit-fixup-squash (2011-10-06) 2 commits
 - completion: commit --fixup and --squash
 - completion: unite --reuse-message and --reedit-message handling

Looked reasonable but completion is not exactly in my area so I'd like to
see others the test these in the real life and give opinions first.

* tm/completion-push-set-upstream (2011-10-06) 1 commit
 - completion: push --set-upstream

Looked reasonable but completion is not exactly in my area so I'd like to
see others the test these in the real life and give opinions first.

* js/no-cherry-pick-head-after-punted (2011-10-06) 1 commit
 - Merge branch 'js/maint-no-cherry-pick-head-after-punted' into js/no-cherry-pick-head-after-punted
 (this branch uses js/maint-no-cherry-pick-head-after-punted.)

Looked reasonable.
Will merge to 'next'.

* js/maint-no-cherry-pick-head-after-punted (2011-10-06) 2 commits
 - cherry-pick: do not give irrelevant advice when cherry-pick punted
 - revert.c: defer writing CHERRY_PICK_HEAD till it is safe to do so
 (this branch is used by js/no-cherry-pick-head-after-punted.)

Looked reasonable.
Will merge to 'next'.

[Stalled]

* jk/http-auth-keyring (2011-09-28) 22 commits
 - credential-cache: don't cache items without context
 - check_expirations: don't copy over same element
 - t0300: add missing EOF terminator for <<
 - credential-store: use a better storage format
 - t0300: make alternate username tests more robust
 - t0300: make askpass tests a little more robust
 - credential-cache: fix expiration calculation corner cases
 - docs: minor tweaks to credentials API
 - credentials: make credential_fill_gently() static
 - credentials: add "getpass" helper
 - credentials: add "store" helper
 - credentials: add "cache" helper
 - docs: end-user documentation for the credential subsystem
 - http: use hostname in credential description
 - allow the user to configure credential helpers
 - look for credentials in config before prompting
 - http: use credential API to get passwords
 - introduce credentials API
 - http: retry authentication failures for all http requests
 - remote-curl: don't retry auth failures with dumb protocol
 - improve httpd auth tests
 - url: decode buffers that are not NUL-terminated
 (this branch is used by js/cred-macos-x-keychain-2.)

Kicked back to 'pu' to allow design level discussions to continue.

* js/cred-macos-x-keychain-2 (2011-10-06) 1 commit
 - contrib: add a pair of credential helpers for Mac OS X's keychain
 (this branch uses jk/http-auth-keyring.)

Kicked back to 'pu' to allow design level discussions to continue.

* hv/submodule-merge-search (2011-08-26) 5 commits
 - submodule: Search for merges only at end of recursive merge
 - allow multiple calls to submodule merge search for the same path
 - submodule: Demonstrate known breakage during recursive merge
 - push: Don't push a repository with unpushed submodules
 - push: teach --recurse-submodules the on-demand option
 (this branch is tangled with fg/submodule-auto-push.)

The second from the bottom one needs to be replaced with a properly
written commit log message.

* fg/submodule-auto-push (2011-09-11) 2 commits
 - submodule.c: make two functions static
 - push: teach --recurse-submodules the on-demand option
 (this branch is tangled with hv/submodule-merge-search.)

What the topic aims to achieve may make sense, but the implementation
looked somewhat suboptimal.

* sr/transport-helper-fix-rfc (2011-07-19) 2 commits
 - t5800: point out that deleting branches does not work
 - t5800: document inability to push new branch with old content

Perhaps 281eee4 (revision: keep track of the end-user input from the
command line, 2011-08-25) would help.

  (merged to 'next' on 2011-10-06 at 36c972d)
 + diff: teach --stat/--numstat to honor -U$num

"diff" is allowed to match the common lines differently depending on how
many context lines it is showing, so running --(num)stat with 0 lines of
context internally gives a result that may be surprising to some people.
