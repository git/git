What's cooking in git.git (Apr 2016, #08; Fri, 29)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

The 'master' branch now has the eighths batch of topics of this
cycle.  On the 'maint' front, 2.8.2 is out.

There are a handful of topics that are stuck; they are marked as
"Needs review", "Needs an Ack", etc. in the following list.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

[Graduated to "master"]

* da/user-useconfigonly (2016-04-01) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-04-22 at 26845a5)
 + ident: give "please tell me" message upon useConfigOnly error
 + ident: check for useConfigOnly before auto-detection of name/email

 The "user.useConfigOnly" configuration variable makes it an error
 if users do not explicitly set user.name and user.email.  However,
 its check was not done early enough and allowed another error to
 trigger, reporting that the default value we guessed from the
 system setting was unusable.  This was a suboptimal end-user
 experience as we want the users to set user.name/user.email without
 relying on the auto-detection at all.


* jc/merge-refuse-new-root (2016-04-21) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-04-22 at 74eb957)
 + pull: pass --allow-unrelated-histories to "git merge"
 + t3033: avoid 'ambiguous refs' warning

 "git pull" has been taught to pass --allow-unrelated-histories
 option to underlying "git merge".


* jk/push-client-deadlock-fix (2016-04-20) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-04-22 at d59a2af)
 + t5504: drop sigpipe=ok from push tests
 + fetch-pack: isolate sigpipe in demuxer thread
 + send-pack: isolate sigpipe in demuxer thread
 + run-command: teach async threads to ignore SIGPIPE
 + send-pack: close demux pipe before finishing async process

 "git push" from a corrupt repository that attempts to push a large
 number of refs deadlocked; the thread to relay rejection notices
 for these ref updates blocked on writing them to the main thread,
 after the main thread at the receiving end notices that the push
 failed and decides not to read these notices and return a failure.


* js/replace-edit-use-editor-configuration (2016-04-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-04-22 at 8df6d30)
 + replace --edit: respect core.editor

 "git replace -e" did not honour "core.editor" configuration.


* js/win32-mmap (2016-04-22) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-04-22 at cd39c60)
 + mmap(win32): avoid expensive fstat() call
 + mmap(win32): avoid copy-on-write when it is unnecessary
 + win32mmap: set errno appropriately

 mmap emulation on Windows has been optimized and work better without
 consuming paging store when not needed.


* nd/test-helpers (2016-04-15) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-04-22 at 55ea5cd)
 + test helpers: move test-* to t/helper/ subdirectory
 + Makefile: clean *.o files we create

 Sources to many test helper binaries (and the generated helpers)
 have been moved to t/helper/ subdirectory to reduce clutter at the
 top level of the tree.


* sb/mv-submodule-fix (2016-04-19) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-04-22 at 089e788)
 + mv: allow moving nested submodules

 "git mv old new" did not adjust the path for a submodule that lives
 as a subdirectory inside old/ directory correctly.


* st/verify-tag (2016-04-22) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-04-22 at 98ba239)
 + tag -v: verify directly rather than exec-ing verify-tag
 + verify-tag: move tag verification code to tag.c
 + verify-tag: prepare verify_tag for libification
 + verify-tag: update variable name and type
 + t7030: test verifying multiple tags
 + builtin/verify-tag.c: ignore SIGPIPE in gpg-interface

 Unify internal logic between "git tag -v" and "git verify-tag"
 commands by making one directly call into the other.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* ab/hooks (2016-04-26) 4 commits
 - hooks: allow customizing where the hook directory is
 - githooks.txt: minor improvements to the grammar & phrasing
 - githooks.txt: amend dangerous advice about 'update' hook ACL
 - githooks.txt: improve the intro section

 A new configuration variable core.hooksPath allows customizing
 where the hook directory is.

 Almost there.

* jc/merge-impossible-no-commit (2016-04-26) 2 commits
 - merge: warn --no-commit merge when no new commit is created
 - merge: do not contaminate option_commit with --squash

 "git merge --no-commit" silently succeeded when there is no need to
 create any commit, either when you are more recent than the commit
 you tried to merge, or you can fast-forward to the commit you tried
 to merge.  The command gives a warning message in such cases.

 Just tying loose ends in a discussion.  Unless somebody else
 champions this topic, I'll drop it.


* jk/fix-attribute-macro-in-2.5 (2016-04-25) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-04-27 at 2e42613)
 + remote.c: spell __attribute__ correctly

 Code fixup.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* js/http-custom-headers (2016-04-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-04-27 at 0c97a50)
 + http: support sending custom HTTP headers

 HTTP transport clients learned to throw extra HTTP headers at the
 server, specified via http.extraHeader configuration variable.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* sb/bisect (2016-04-15) 22 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - bisect: get back halfway shortcut
 - bisect: compute best bisection in compute_relevant_weights()
 - bisect: use a bottom-up traversal to find relevant weights
 - bisect: prepare for different algorithms based on find_all
 - bisect: rename count_distance() to compute_weight()
 - bisect: make total number of commits global
 - bisect: introduce distance_direction()
 - bisect: extract get_distance() function from code duplication
 - bisect: use commit instead of commit list as arguments when appropriate
 - bisect: replace clear_distance() by unique markers
 - bisect: use struct node_data array instead of int array
 - bisect: get rid of recursion in count_distance()
 - bisect: make algorithm behavior independent of DEBUG_BISECT
 - bisect: make bisect compile if DEBUG_BISECT is set
 - bisect: plug the biggest memory leak
 - bisect: add test for the bisect algorithm
 - t6030: generalize test to not rely on current implementation
 - t: use test_cmp_rev() where appropriate
 - t/test-lib-functions.sh: generalize test_cmp_rev
 - bisect: allow 'bisect run' if no good commit is known
 - bisect: write about `bisect next` in documentation

 The internal algorithm used in "git bisect" to find the next commit
 to check has been optimized greatly.

 Expecting a reroll.

* bn/http-cookiefile-config (2016-04-29) 2 commits
 - http: expand http.cookieFile as a path
 - Documentation: config: improve word ordering for http.cookieFile
 (this branch uses jc/config-pathname-type.)

 "http.cookieFile" configuration variable clearly wants a pathname,
 but we forgot to treat it as such by e.g. applying tilde expansion.

 Waiting for an Ack to what's queued with tweaks, or a reroll.
 ($gmane/292969)


* ew/doc-split-pack-disables-bitmap (2016-04-28) 1 commit

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jc/config-pathname-type (2016-04-29) 1 commit
 - config: describe 'pathname' value type
 (this branch is used by bn/http-cookiefile-config.)

 Consolidate description of tilde-expansion that is done to
 configuration variables that take pathname to a single place.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/submodule-config-sanitize-fix (2016-04-28) 5 commits
 - submodule: use prepare_submodule_repo_env consistently
 - submodule--helper: move config-sanitizing to submodule.c
 - submodule: export sanitized GIT_CONFIG_PARAMETERS
 - t5550: break submodule config test into multiple sub-tests
 - t5550: fix typo in $HTTPD_URL

 An earlier addition of "sanitize_submodule_env" with 14111fc4 (git:
 submodule honor -c credential.* from command line, 2016-02-29)
 turned out to be a convoluted no-op; implement what it wanted to do
 correctly.

 With a rethink of the merit of "sanitization" going on, we may end
 up doing the configuration propagation very differently, though.

 Will hold.


* mh/connect-leak (2016-04-28) 1 commit
 - git_connect(): fix memory leak with CONNECT_DIAG_URL

 Is already made obsolete with a patch in flight under discussion.
 ($gmane/292962)

 - config.c: drop local variable

 Will merge to 'next'.

[Stalled]

* ar/diff-args-osx-precompose (2016-04-05) 1 commit
 - diff: run arguments through precompose_argv

 Many commands normalize command line arguments from NFD to NFC
 variant of UTF-8 on OSX, but commands in the "diff" family did
 not, causing "git diff $path" to complain that no such path is
 known to Git.  They have been taught to do the normalization.

 Will be rerolled?
 ($gmane/290724)


* nd/shallow-deepen (2016-04-13) 26 commits
 - fetch, upload-pack: --deepen=N extends shallow boundary by N commits
 - upload-pack: add get_reachable_list()
 - upload-pack: split check_unreachable() in two, prep for get_reachable_list()
 - t5500, t5539: tests for shallow depth excluding a ref
 - clone: define shallow clone boundary with --shallow-exclude
 - fetch: define shallow boundary with --shallow-exclude
 - upload-pack: support define shallow boundary by excluding revisions
 - refs: add expand_ref()
 - t5500, t5539: tests for shallow depth since a specific date
 - clone: define shallow clone boundary based on time with --shallow-since
 - fetch: define shallow boundary with --shallow-since
 - upload-pack: add deepen-since to cut shallow repos based on time
 - shallow.c: implement a generic shallow boundary finder based on rev-list
 - fetch-pack: use a separate flag for fetch in deepening mode
 - fetch-pack.c: mark strings for translating
 - fetch-pack: use a common function for verbose printing
 - fetch-pack: use skip_prefix() instead of starts_with()
 - upload-pack: move rev-list code out of check_non_tip()
 - upload-pack: tighten number parsing at "deepen" lines
 - upload-pack: use skip_prefix() instead of starts_with()
 - upload-pack: move "unshallow" sending code out of deepen()
 - upload-pack: remove unused variable "backup"
 - upload-pack: move "shallow" sending code out of deepen()
 - upload-pack: move shallow deepen code out of receive_needs()
 - transport-helper.c: refactor set_helper_option()
 - remote-curl.c: convert fetch_git() to use argv_array

 The existing "git fetch --depth=<n>" option was hard to use
 correctly when making the history of an existing shallow clone
 deeper.  A new option, "--deepen=<n>", has been added to make this
 easier to use.  "git clone" also learned "--shallow-since=<date>"
 and "--shallow-exclude=<tag>" options to make it easier to specify
 "I am interested only in the recent N months worth of history" and
 "Give me only the history since that version".

 Needs review.


* sg/completion-updates (2016-02-28) 21 commits
 - completion: cache the path to the repository
 - completion: extract repository discovery from __gitdir()
 - completion: don't guard git executions with __gitdir()

 - completion tests: add tests for the __git_refs() helper function
 - completion tests: check __gitdir()'s output in the error cases
 - completion tests: consolidate getting path of current working directory
 - completion tests: make the $cur variable local to the test helper functions
 - completion tests: don't add test cruft to the test repository
 - completion: improve __git_refs()'s in-code documentation

 Will be rerolled.

* az/p4-bare-no-rebase (2016-02-19) 1 commit
 - git-p4.py: Don't try to rebase on submit from bare repository

 "git p4 submit" attempts to do a rebase, which would fail if done
 in a bare repository.  Not doing this rebase would paper over the
 failure, which is what this patch does, but it is unclear what the
 side effect of not rebasing is.

 Needs a better explanation.


* ss/commit-dry-run-resolve-merge-to-no-op (2016-02-17) 1 commit
 - wt-status.c: set commitable bit if there is a meaningful merge.

 "git commit --dry-run" reported "No, no, you cannot commit." in one
 case where "git commit" would have allowed you to commit, and this
 improves it a little bit ("git commit --dry-run --short" still does
 not give you the correct answer, for example).


* nd/icase (2016-02-15) 12 commits

 - test-regex: expose full regcomp() to the command line
 - test-regex: isolate the bug test code

* js/am-3-merge-recursive-direct (2015-10-12) 2 commits
 - am: make a direct call to merge_recursive
 - merge_recursive_options: introduce the "gently" flag

 The merge_recursive_generic() function has been made a bit safer to
 call from inside a process.  "git am -3" was taught to make a direct
 call to the function when falling back to three-way merge.

 Being able to make a direct call would be good in general, but as a
 performance thing, the change needs to be backed up by numbers.

 I haven't gone through the "gently" change with fine toothed comb;
 I can see that the change avoids calling die(), but I haven't made
 sure that the program states (e.g. what's in the in-core index) are
 adjusted sensibly when it returns to the caller instead of dying,
 or the codepaths that used to die() are free of resource leaks.
 The original code certainly did not care the program states at the
 point of dying exactly because it knew it is going to exit, but now
 they have to care, and they need to be audited.

 Will be rerolled.

* jc/diff-b-m (2015-02-23) 5 commits
 . WIPWIP
 . WIP: diff-b-m
 - diffcore-rename: allow easier debugging
 - diffcore-rename.c: add locate_rename_src()
 - diffcore-break: allow debugging

 "git diff -B -M" produced incorrect patch when the postimage of a
 completely rewritten file is similar to the preimage of a removed
 file; such a resulting file must not be expressed as a rename from
 other place.

 The fix in this patch is broken, unfortunately.
 Will discard.

[Cooking]

* js/name-rev-use-oldest-ref (2016-04-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-04-27 at 8fdc0ac)
 + name-rev: include taggerdate in considering the best name

 "git describe --contains" often made a hard-to-justify choice of
 tag to give name to a given commit, because it tried to come up
 with a name with smallest number of hops from a tag, causing an old
 commit whose close descendant that is recently tagged were not
 described with respect to an old tag but with a newer tag.  It did
 not help that its computation of "hop" count was further tweaked to
 penalize being on a side branch of a merge.  The logic has been
 updated to favor using the tag with the oldest tagger date, which
 is a lot easier to explain to the end users: "We describe a commit
 in terms of the (chronologically) oldest tag that contains the
 commit."

* tb/convert-eol-autocrlf (2016-04-29) 10 commits
 - ce_compare_data() did not respect conversion
 - t6038; use crlf on all platforms
 - convert.c: more safer crlf handling with text attribute
 - convert: unify the "auto" handling of CRLF
 - convert.c: stream and early out
 - read-cache: factor out get_sha1_from_index() helper
 - convert.c: ident + core.autocrlf didn't work
 - t0027: test cases for combined attributes
 - convert: allow core.autocrlf=input and core.eol=crlf
 - t0027: make commit_chk_wrnNNO() reliable

 The combination of text=auto & eol=crlf (or eol=lf for that matter)
 is taught to be much more useful; it used to be "auto detection"
 was defeated as if setting eol declares that the file _is_ text,
 but now text=auto is still in effect for such a path and the code
 refrains from applying eol conversion if it found the path is not
 text.  Also setting core.autocrlf to 'input' and core.eol to 'crlf'
 used to be rejected, but because the code gives precedence to
 core.autocrlf, there is no need to, hence we no longer reject the
 combination.

 The last step seems to be identical to what I earlier did and
 discarded because the approach is fundamentally wrong, but I may be
 misreading the patch.

 - dir.c: rename str(n)cmp_icase to fspath(n)cmp

 The experimental "multiple worktree" feature gains more safety to
 forbid operations on a branch that is checked out or being actively
 worked on elsewhere, by noticing that e.g. it is being rebased.

 Being reviewed.

* bw/rebase-merge-entire-branch (2016-04-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-04-29 at 7a9487f)
 + git-rebase--merge: don't include absent parent as a base

 "git rebase -m" could be asked to rebase an entire branch starting
 from the root, but failed by assuming that there always is a parent
 commit to the first commit on the branch.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* pb/commit-verbose-config (2016-04-19) 6 commits
 - commit: add a commit.verbose config variable
 - t7507-commit-verbose: improve test coverage by testing number of diffs
 - parse-options.c: make OPTION_COUNTUP respect "unspecified" values
 - t0040-parse-options: improve test coverage
 - test-parse-options: print quiet as integer
 - t0040-test-parse-options.sh: fix style issues

 "git commit" learned to pay attention to "commit.verbose"
 configuration variable and act as if "--verbose" option was
 given from the command line.

 Need a reroll but it will be some time before that happens.
 ($gmane/292160).


* en/merge-fixes (2016-04-12) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-04-27 at 14d7d10)
 + merge-recursive: do not check working copy when creating a virtual merge base
 + merge-recursive: remove duplicate code

 "merge-recursive" strategy incorrectly checked if a path that is
 involved in its internal merge exists in the working tree.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/fsck-nul-in-commit (2016-04-14) 2 commits
 - fsck: detect and warn a commit with embedded NUL
 - fsck_commit_buffer(): do not special case the last validation

 "git fsck" learned to catch NUL byte in a commit object as
 potential error and warn.


* jc/ll-merge-internal (2016-04-27) 3 commits
 - t6036: remove pointless test that expects failure
 - ll-merge: use a longer conflict marker for internal merge
 - ll-merge: fix typo in comment

 RFC.


* jk/diff-compact-heuristic (2016-04-19) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-04-22 at 0c117ea)
 + xdiff: implement empty line chunk heuristic
 + xdiff: add recs_match helper function

 Patch output from "git diff" and friends has been tweaked to be
 more readable by using a blank line as a strong hint that the
 contents before and after it belong to a logically separate unit.

 Will merge to 'master' after removing the experimentation knob.


* sb/submodule-init (2016-04-29) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-04-29 at 3e81ee88)
 + submodule--helper update-clone: abort gracefully on missing .gitmodules
 + submodule init: fail gracefully with a missing .gitmodules file
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-04-27 at afaad81)
 + submodule: port init from shell to C
 + submodule: port resolve_relative_url from shell to C
 + Merge branch 'sb/submodule-path-misc-bugs' into sb/submodule-init
 + Merge branch 'sb/submodule-helper-clone-regression-fix' into sb/submodule-init

 Update of "git submodule" to move pieces of logic to C continues.

 Will cook for a bit more in 'next'.


* jc/send-email-skip-backup (2016-04-12) 1 commit
 - send-email: detect and offer to skip backup files

 A careless invocation of "git send-email directory/" after editing
 0001-change.patch with an editor often ends up sending both
 0001-change.patch and its backup file, 0001-change.patch~, causing
 embarrassment and a minor confusion.  Detect such an input and
 offer to skip the backup files when sending the patches out.

 Needs review.


* nf/mergetool-prompt (2016-04-25) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-04-27 at 1c992df)
 + difftool/mergetool: make the form of yes/no questions consistent

 UI consistency improvements.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* va/i18n-misc-updates (2016-04-19) 9 commits
 - i18n: builtin/pull.c: split strings marked for translation
 - i18n: builtin/pull.c: mark placeholders for translation
 - i18n: git-parse-remote.sh: mark strings for translation
 - i18n: branch: move comment for translators
 - i18n: branch: unmark string for translation
 - i18n: builtin/rm.c: remove a comma ',' from string
 - i18n: unpack-trees: mark strings for translation
 - i18n: builtin/branch.c: mark option for translation
 - i18n: index-pack: use plural string instead of normal one

 Mark several messages for translation.

 Comments?  They looked all sensible to me.


* jc/drop-git-spec-in (2016-04-27) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-04-27 at 2b85030)
 + Makefile: remove dependency on git.spec
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-04-22 at 531583f)
 + Makefile: stop pretending to support rpmbuild

 As nobody maintains our in-tree git.spec.in and distros use their
 own spec file, we stopped pretending that we support "make rpm".

 Will merge to 'master'.

 The code to list branches in "git branch" has been consolidated
 with the more generic ref-filter API.

 Needs review.


* xy/format-patch-base (2016-04-26) 4 commits
 - format-patch: introduce format.useAutoBase configuration
 - format-patch: introduce --base=auto option
 - format-patch: add '--base' option to record base tree info
 - patch-ids: make commit_patch_id() a public helper function

 "git format-patch" learned a new "--base" option to record what
 (public, well-known) commit the original series was built on in
 its output.

 Looking close to be ready.
 ($gmane/292622).

 Needs review.
 t7900#5 seems to fail for me.


* jc/bundle (2016-03-03) 6 commits
 - index-pack: --clone-bundle option
 - Merge branch 'jc/index-pack' into jc/bundle
 - bundle v3: the beginning
 - bundle: keep a copy of bundle file name in the in-core bundle header
 - bundle: plug resource leak
 - bundle doc: 'verify' is not about verifying the bundle

 The beginning of "split bundle", which could be one of the
 ingredients to allow "git clone" traffic off of the core server
 network to CDN.


* jc/merge-drop-old-syntax (2015-04-29) 1 commit
 - merge: drop 'git merge <message> HEAD <commit>' syntax

 Stop supporting "git merge <message> HEAD <commit>" syntax that has
 been deprecated since October 2007, and issues a deprecation
 warning message since v2.5.0.

 It has been reported that git-gui still uses the deprecated syntax,
 which needs to be fixed before this final step can proceed.
