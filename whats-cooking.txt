What's cooking in git.git (May 2012, #04; Fri, 11)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.

The tenth and eleventh batch of topics are now in 'master', and there is
the second maintenance release on the 1.7.10.x track out.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches of the
repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* ah/maint-grep-double-init (2012-05-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-05-08 at 51f84c5)
 + grep.c: remove redundant line of code

* ef/checkout-empty (2012-05-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-05-08 at fc4d754)
 + checkout: do not corrupt HEAD on empty repo

Running "git checkout" on an unborn branch used to corrupt HEAD
(regression in 1.7.10); this makes it error out.

* ef/maint-1.7.6-clone-progress-fix (2012-05-07) 1 commit
 + clone: fix progress-regression
 (this branch is used by ef/maint-clone-progress-fix.)

* ef/maint-clone-progress-fix (2012-05-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-05-08 at b9a6cad)
 + Merge branch 'ef/maint-1.7.6-clone-progress-fix' into ef/maint-clone-progress-fix
 (this branch uses ef/maint-1.7.6-clone-progress-fix.)

Some time ago, "git clone" lost the progress output for its "checkout"
phase; when run without any "--quiet" option, it should give progress to
the lengthy operation.

* fa/maint-config-doc (2012-05-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-05-08 at 54cc478)
 + Documentation/git-config: describe and clarify "--local <file>" option

* jc/install-no-hardlinks (2012-05-04) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-05-07 at b69e132)
 + Makefile: NO_INSTALL_HARDLINKS

Your build platform may support hardlinks but you may prefer not to use
them, e.g. when installing to DESTDIR to make a tarball and untarring on
a filesystem that has poor support for hardlinks.

The Makefile in git-gui project may need to learn to honor the same
setting; it unconditionally creates git-citool by hardlinking git-gui.

* jk/maint-reflog-walk-count-vs-time (2012-05-07) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-05-08 at b1a9987)
 + reflog-walk: tell explicit --date=default from not having --date at all
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-05-07 at 3652958)
 + reflog-walk: always make HEAD@{0} show indexed selectors
 + reflog-walk: clean up "flag" field of commit_reflog struct
 + log: respect date_mode_explicit with --format:%gd
 + t1411: add more selector index/date tests

Gives a better DWIM behaviour for --pretty=format:%gd, "stash list", and
"log -g", depending on how the starting point ("master" vs "master@{0}" vs
"master@{now}") and date formatting options (e.g. "--date=iso") are given
on the command line.

* jk/maint-status-porcelain-z-b (2012-05-08) 4 commits
 + status: respect "-b" for porcelain format
 + status: fix null termination with "-b"
 + status: refactor null_termination option
 + commit: refactor option parsing
 (this branch is used by jk/status-porcelain-z-b.)

* jk/status-porcelain-z-b (2012-05-08) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-05-08 at 31172dd)
 + status: refactor colopts handling
 + Merge branch 'jk/maint-status-porcelain-z-b' into HEAD
 (this branch uses jk/maint-status-porcelain-z-b.)

"git status --porcelain" ignored "--branch" option by mistake.  The output
for "git status --branch -z" was also incorrect and did not terminate the
record for the current branch name with NUL as asked.

* js/checkout-detach-count (2012-05-04) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-05-07 at 2957590)
 + checkout (detached): truncate list of orphaned commits at the new HEAD
 + t2020-checkout-detach: check for the number of orphaned commits

When checking out another commit from an already detached state, we used
to report all commits that are not reachable from any of the refs as
lossage, but some of them might be reachable from the new HEAD, and there
is no need to warn about them.

* mh/ref-api-lazy-loose (2012-05-04) 18 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-05-04 at a70d858)
 + refs: fix find_containing_dir() regression
 + refs: read loose references lazily
 + read_loose_refs(): eliminate ref_cache argument
 + struct ref_dir: store a reference to the enclosing ref_cache
 + search_for_subdir(): return (ref_dir *) instead of (ref_entry *)
 + get_ref_dir(): add function for getting a ref_dir from a ref_entry
 + read_loose_refs(): rename function from get_ref_dir()
 + refs: wrap top-level ref_dirs in ref_entries
 + find_containing_dir(): use strbuf in implementation of this function
 + bisect: copy filename string obtained from git_path()
 + do_for_each_reflog(): use a strbuf to hold logfile name
 + do_for_each_reflog(): return early on error
 + get_ref_dir(): take the containing directory as argument
 + refs.c: extract function search_for_subdir()
 + get_ref_dir(): require that the dirname argument ends in '/'
 + get_ref_dir(): rename "base" parameter to "dirname"
 + get_ref_dir(): use a strbuf to hold refname
 + get_ref_dir(): return early if directory cannot be read

Refs API is updated to lazily read sub-hierarchies of refs/ namespace,
so that we do not have to grab everything from the filesystem when we
are only interested in listing branches, for example.

* nd/i18n-apply-lego (2012-05-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-05-08 at c2be904)
 + apply: remove lego in i18n string in gitdiff_verify_name

* nd/i18n-branch-lego (2012-05-04) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-05-07 at af4e16f)
 + branch: remove lego in i18n tracking info strings

Fix yet another message construction by concatenating pieces of sentenes,
which is unfriendly to i18n.

* nd/stream-to-archive (2012-05-03) 10 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-05-07 at 92f11c4)
 + t5000: rationalize unzip tests
 + archive-zip: streaming for deflated files
 + archive-zip: streaming for stored files
 + archive-zip: factor out helpers for writing sizes and CRC
 + archive-zip: remove uncompressed_size
 + archive-tar: stream large blobs to tar file
 + archive: delegate blob reading to backend
 + archive-tar: unindent write_tar_entry by one level
 + archive-tar: turn write_tar_entry into blob-writing only
 + streaming: void pointer instead of char pointer

Stream large blobs directly out to archive files without slurping
everything in memory first.

* rs/dir-strbuf (2012-05-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-05-08 at 0bc94fb)
 + Merge branch 'rs/maint-dir-strbuf' into rs/dir-strbuf
 (this branch uses rs/maint-dir-strbuf.)

* rs/maint-dir-strbuf (2012-05-08) 1 commit
 + dir: convert to strbuf
 (this branch is used by rs/dir-strbuf.)

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* rs/xdiff-lose-emit-func (2012-05-09) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-05-11 at 1eeb893)
 + xdiff: remove unused functions
 + xdiff: remove emit_func() and xdi_diff_hunks()
 + blame: factor out helper for calling xdi_diff()
 + blame: use hunk_func(), part 2
 + blame: use hunk_func(), part 1
 + xdiff: add hunk_func()

Simplifies the interface between the implementation of "blame" and
underlying xdiff engine, and removes a lot of unnecessary code from
the latter.

* sg/bash-prompt (2012-05-09) 4 commits
 - completion: respect $GIT_DIR
 - completion: use __gitdir() in _git_log()
 - tests: add tests for the bash prompt functions in the completion script
 - tests: move code to run tests under bash into a helper library

This is only the "correction" bits taken from the beginning of a larger
series that is to be rerolled.

* jc/apply-3way (2012-05-10) 9 commits
 - apply: document --3way option
 - apply: allow rerere() upon --3way results
 - apply: register conflicted stages to the index
 - apply: plug the three-way merge logic in
 - apply: fall back on three-way merge
 - apply: accept -3/--3way command line option
 - apply: split load_preimage() helper function out
 - apply: refactor read_file_or_gitlink()
 - apply: clear_image() clears things a bit more

"git apply" learns to wiggle the base version and perform three-way merge
when a patch does not exactly apply to the version you have.

* ld/git-p4-tags-and-labels (2012-05-11) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-05-11 at 441bd9a)
 + git p4: fix bug when enabling tag import/export via config variables
 + git p4: fix bug when verbose enabled with tag export
 + git p4: add test for tag import/export enabled via config

* rs/dir-strbuf-read-recursive-fix (2012-05-11) 2 commits
 - dir: simplify fill_directory()
 - dir: respect string length argument of read_directory_recursive()

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* jc/maint-push-refs-all (2012-05-04) 2 commits
 - get_fetch_map(): tighten checks on dest refs
 - fetch/push: allow refs/*:refs/*

Allows pushing and fetching refs/stash.
Not ready.
There still seem to be other bugs hiding (e.g. try pushing twice).

* jc/run-hook-env-1 (2012-03-11) 1 commit
 - run_hook(): enhance the interface to pass arbitrary environment

Not urgent.

Updates run_hook() API to be much less specific to "commit".  It would
only be useful if people start doing more interesting things with hooks.

* jc/split-blob (2012-04-03) 6 commits
 - chunked-object: streaming checkout
 - chunked-object: fallback checkout codepaths
 - bulk-checkin: support chunked-object encoding
 - bulk-checkin: allow the same data to be multiply hashed
 - new representation types in the packstream
 - packfile: use varint functions

Not ready.

I finished the streaming checkout codepath, but as explained in
127b177 (bulk-checkin: support chunked-object encoding, 2011-11-30),
these are still early steps of a long and painful journey. At least
pack-objects and fsck need to learn the new encoding for the series
to be usable locally, and then index-pack/unpack-objects needs to
learn it to be used remotely.

Given that I heard a lot of noise that people want large files, and
that I was asked by somebody at GitTogether'11 privately for an
advice on how to pay developers (not me) to help adding necessary
support, I am somewhat dissapointed that the original patch series
that was sent almost two months ago still remains here without much
comments and updates from the developer community. I even made the
interface to the logic that decides where to split chunks easily
replaceable, and I deliberately made the logic in the original patch
extremely stupid to entice others, especially the "bup" fanboys, to
come up with a better logic, thinking that giving people an easy
target to shoot for, they may be encouraged to help out. The plan is
not working :-(.

[Cooking]

* nl/http-proxy-more (2012-05-11) 2 commits
 - http: rename HTTP_REAUTH to HTTP_AUTH_RETRY
 - http: Avoid limit of retrying request only twice

I queued only the later two patches from this series, even though they do
not make much sense without the first one that seems to need a bit more
work, so that we won't forget.

* fc/simplify-complete-revlist-file (2012-05-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-05-08 at ff0b7d1)
 + completion: simplify __git_complete_revlist_file

Will merge to 'master'.

* nd/i18n-parseopt (2012-05-08) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-05-08 at 15eb029)
 + i18n: apply: mark parseopt strings for translation
 + i18n: parseopt: lookup help and argument translations when showing usage

Text from "git cmd --help" are getting prepared for i18n.

* nd/threaded-index-pack (2012-05-07) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-05-08 at 053b797)
 + index-pack: disable threading if NO_PREAD is defined
 + index-pack: support multithreaded delta resolving
 + index-pack: restructure pack processing into three main functions
 + compat/win32/pthread.h: Add an pthread_key_delete() implementation

Enables threading in index-pack to resolve base data in parallel.

Will merge to 'master'.

* mm/push-default-switch-warning (2012-04-26) 2 commits
 - t5541: warning message is given even with --quiet
 - push: start warning upcoming default change for push.default

Will squash the two, but this has to wait for a few release cycles.

--------------------------------------------------
[Discarded]

* cb/daemon-test-race-fix (2012-04-27) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-04-27 at 84bbcf8)
 + Revert "git-daemon wrapper to wait until daemon is ready"
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-04-24 at d5c30be)
 + git-daemon wrapper to wait until daemon is ready

Fix race condition between starting and waiting for git-daemon in the
test.

Reverted from 'next' to replace it with js/daemon-test-race-fix.
