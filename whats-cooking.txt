What's cooking in git.git (Nov 2020, #04; Thu, 19)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'seen' (formerly 'pu'---proposed updates) while commits prefixed
with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

The sixth batch of topics are in 'master' and the tests are being
prepared not to be disrupted by a potential change of the default
name for the initial branch.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into.  Some repositories have
only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

Release tarballs are available at:

[Graduated to 'master']

* ds/maintenance-part-3 (2020-10-16) 8 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-11-10 at fe9475c696)
 + maintenance: add troubleshooting guide to docs
 + maintenance: use 'incremental' strategy by default
 + maintenance: create maintenance.strategy config

 (this branch is used by ds/maintenance-part-4.)

 Parts of "git maintenance" to ease writing crontab entries (and
 other scheduling system configuration) for it.


* dd/upload-pack-stateless-eof (2020-10-30) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-11-09 at 01a1f1d4fd)
 + upload-pack: allow stateless client EOF just prior to haves

 "git fetch --depth=<n>" over the stateless RPC / smart HTTP
 transport handled EOF from the client poorly at the server end.


* dg/bswap-msvc (2020-11-11) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-11-11 at 6b9e819b17)

 + compat/bswap.h: simplify MSVC endianness detection

 Define ARM64 compiled with MSVC to be little-endian.


* en/merge-ort-api-null-impl (2020-11-02) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-11-10 at ed9eed1558)
 + merge,rebase,revert: select ort or recursive by config or environment
 + fast-rebase: demonstrate merge-ort's API via new test-tool command
 + merge-ort-wrappers: new convience wrappers to mimic the old merge API

  (merged to 'next' on 2020-11-09 at 8ac9fe94a7)
 + t6423: add more details about direct resolution of directories

 + t/: new helper for tests that pass with ort but fail with recursive

 Preparation for a new merge strategy.


* jc/blame-ignore-fix (2020-11-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-11-10 at 384ace449d)
 + blame: silently ignore invalid ignore file objects

 "git blame --ignore-revs-file=<file>" learned to ignore a
 non-existent object name in the input, instead of complaining.


* jc/line-log-takes-no-pathspec (2020-11-04) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-11-09 at 47c2c88b9d)
 + log: diagnose -L used with pathspec as an error

 "git log -L<range>:<path>" is documented to take no pathspec, but
 this was not enforced by the command line option parser, which has
 been corrected.


* jc/sparse-error-for-developer-build (2020-10-31) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-11-10 at 8cfbe66736)
 + Makefile: enable -Wsparse-error for DEVELOPER build

 "make DEVELOPER=1 sparse" used to run sparse and let it emit
 warnings; now such warnings will cause an error.


* jk/format-patch-output (2020-11-04) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-11-09 at 1f1bb6ebff)
 + format-patch: support --output option
 + format-patch: tie file-opening logic to output_directory
 + format-patch: refactor output selection

 "git format-patch --output=there" did not work as expected and
 instead crashed.  The option is now supported.


* js/default-branch-name-adjust-t5515 (2020-11-02) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-11-09 at 568ba5aba5)

 + t5515: use `main` as the name of the main branch for testing (part 2)
 + t5515: use `main` as the name of the main branch for testing (part 1)

 Prepare a test script to transition of the default branch name to
 'main'.


* nk/perf-fsmonitor (2020-10-26) 10 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-11-09 at 9fed160a17)
 + t/perf/fsmonitor: add benchmark for dirty status
 + t/perf/fsmonitor: perf comparison of multiple fsmonitor integrations
 + t/perf/fsmonitor: initialize test with git reset
 + t/perf/fsmonitor: factor setup for fsmonitor into function
 + t/perf/fsmonitor: silence initial git commit

 + t/perf/fsmonitor: improve error message if typoing hook name
 + t/perf/fsmonitor: move watchman setup to one-time-repo-setup
 + t/perf/fsmonitor: separate one time repo initialization

 Add t/perf support for fsmonitor.


* pb/blame-funcname-range-userdiff (2020-11-01) 8 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-11-10 at 221bb3f773)
 + blame: simplify 'setup_blame_bloom_data' interface
 + blame: simplify 'setup_scoreboard' interface
 + blame: enable funcname blaming with userdiff driver
 + line-log: mention both modes in 'blame' and 'log' short help
 + doc: add more pointers to gitattributes(5) for userdiff
 + blame-options.txt: also mention 'funcname' in '-L' description
 + doc: line-range: improve formatting
 + doc: log, gitk: move '-L' description to 'line-range-options.txt'

 "git blame -L :funcname -- path" did not work well for a path for
 which a userdiff driver is defined.


* pw/rebase-i-orig-head (2020-11-04) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-11-10 at 038a5295f5)
 + rebase -i: simplify get_revision_ranges()
 + rebase -i: use struct object_id when writing state
 + rebase -i: use struct object_id rather than looking up commit
 + rebase -i: stop overwriting ORIG_HEAD buffer

 "git rebase -i" did not store ORIG_HEAD correctly.

* rs/archive-high-compression (2020-11-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-11-10 at 9bee80950e)

 "git archive" now allows compression level higher than "-9"
 when generating tar.gz output.


* rs/empty-reflog-check-fix (2020-11-01) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-11-09 at 3da6b6fef0)

 The code to see if "git stash drop" can safely remove refs/stash
 has been made more carerful.

* sg/bisect-approximately-halfway (2020-11-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-11-18 at b13026a0f3)
 + bisect: loosen halfway() check for a large number of commits

 "git bisect start/next" in a large span of history spends a lot of
 time trying to come up with exactly the half-way point; this can be
 optimized by stopping when we see a commit that is close enough to
 the half-way point.

 Will merge to 'master'.

* ab/retire-parse-remote (2020-11-16) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-11-18 at 80d4d8290c)
 + parse-remote: remove this now-unused library
 + submodule: remove sh function in favor of helper
 + submodule: use "fetch" logic instead of custom remote discovery

 "git-parse-remote" shell script library outlived its usefulness.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/4gb-idx (2020-11-16) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-11-18 at 2f99b73bda)
 + packfile: detect overflow in .idx file size checks
 + block-sha1: take a size_t length parameter
 + fsck: correctly compute checksums on idx files larger than 4GB
 + use size_t to store pack .idx byte offsets
 + compute pack .idx byte offsets using size_t

 The code was not prepared to deal with pack .idx file that is
 larger than 4GB.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ma/list-object-filter-opt-msgfix (2020-11-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-11-18 at 7cf396ee81)
 + list-objects-filter-options: fix function name in BUG

 Error message fix.

 Will merge to 'master'.
 We can further update it to lose the hand-maintained function name
 from the message, but that can be done separately.


* mt/rm-sparse-checkout (2020-11-16) 1 commit
 - rm: honor sparse checkout patterns
 (this branch uses mt/grep-sparse-checkout.)

 "git rm" follows suit to "git grep" to ignore paths outside the
 sparsity pattern when the sparse checkout feature is in use.


* pb/pull-rebase-recurse-submodules (2020-11-16) 4 commits
 - pull: check for local submodule modifications with the right range
 - t5572: describe '--rebase' tests a little more
 - t5572: add notes on a peculiar test
 - pull --rebase: compute rebase arguments in separate function

 "git pull --rebase --recurse-submodules" checked for local changes
 in a wrong range and failed to run correctly when it should.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* pk/subsub-fetch-fix (2020-11-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-11-18 at bdd3b21b7c)
 + submodules: fix of regression on fetching of non-init subsub-repo

 "git fetch" did not work correctly with nested submodules where the
 innermost submodule that is not of interest got updated in the
 upstream, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* rs/archive-plug-leak-refname (2020-11-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-11-19 at 270ba7b8be)
 + archive: release refname after use

 Memleak fix.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 leak checker.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 - diff-lib: plug minor memory leaks in do_diff_cache()

 Memleak fix.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sg/t5310-jgit-wants-sha1 (2020-11-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-11-19 at 72fb4e7155)
 + t5310-pack-bitmaps: skip JGit tests with SHA256

 Since jgit does not yet work with SHA-256 repositories, mark the
 tests that uses it not to run unless we are testing with ShA-1
 repositories.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* tb/repack-simplify (2020-11-17) 3 commits
 - builtin/repack.c: don't move existing packs out of the way
 - builtin/repack.c: keep track of what pack-objects wrote
 - repack: make "exts" array available outside cmd_repack()

 Simplify the logic to deal with a repack operation that ended up
 creating the same packfile.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* dd/help-autocorrect-never (2020-11-18) 1 commit
 - help.c: allow help.autocorrect to say "do not even compute suggestions"

 "git $cmd $args", when $cmd is not a recognised subcommand, by
 default tries to see if $cmd is a typo of an existing subcommand
 and optionally executes the corrected command if there is only one
 possibility, depending on the setting of help.autocorrect; the
 users can now disable the whole thing, including the cycles spent
 to find a likely typo, by setting the configuration variable to
 'never'.


* jc/ci-github-set-env (2020-11-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-11-19 at 00ff5e06ac)

* jk/symlinked-dotgitx-files (2020-10-23) 9 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-10-26 at c1dd37b024)
 + docs: document symlink restrictions for .git* files
 + fsck: complain when .gitattributes or .gitignore is a symlink
 + verify_path(): disallow symlinks in .gitattributes and .gitignore
 + t0060: test obscured .gitattributes and .gitignore matching
 + t7450: test .gitmodules symlink matching against obscured names
 + t7450: test verify_path() handling of gitmodules
 + t7415: rename to expand scope
 + fsck_tree(): wrap some long lines
 + fsck_tree(): fix shadowed variable

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2020-10-23

 "git fsck" and the corresponding check done during the transport
 learned to ensure that in-tree files like `.gitignore` and
 `.gitattributes` are not symbolic links.

 It seems that there are real projects with .gitignore recorded as
 symlinks, which may need to loosen the fsck setting.  Do we need to
 introduce a class that is separate from symlinked .gitmodules that
 probably is with potential consequences that is more/less grave?


* es/config-hooks (2020-10-16) 8 commits
 - hook: replace find_hook() with hook_exists()

 Allow the configuration to specify no abbreviation regardless of
 the hash algorithm.

 Expecting a reroll.  The intent is very good.

* jc/war-on-dashed-git (2020-08-27) 1 commit
 - git: catch an attempt to run "git-foo"

 The first step to remove on-disk binaries for built-in subcommands
 by soliciting objections.

 On hold for now.


* dr/push-remoteref-fix (2020-04-23) 1 commit
 - remote.c: fix handling of %(push:remoteref)

 The "%(push:remoteref)" placeholder in the "--format=" argument of
 "git format-patch" (and friends) only showed what got explicitly
 configured, not what ref at the receiving end would be updated when
 "git push" was used, as it ignored the default behaviour (e.g. update

 - zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

* sj/untracked-files-in-submodule-directory-is-not-dirty (2020-10-26) 1 commit
 - diff: do not show submodule with untracked files as "-dirty"

 "git diff" showed a submodule working tree with untracked cruft as
 "Submodule commit <objectname>-dirty", but a natural expectation is
 that the "-dirty" indicator would align with "git describe --dirty",
 which does not consider having untracked files in the working tree
 as source of dirtiness.  The inconsistency has been fixed.

 Needs doc update and also adjusting "git status".

 "git push" learns a way to tell an object that it expects the other
 side to have and is usable as a common ancestor, which can be used
 by the other side to shrink its initial ref advertisement.
