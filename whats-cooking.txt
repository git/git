What's cooking in git.git (Sep 2008, #05; Mon, 29)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed
with '-' are only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are
in 'next'.

The topics list the commits in reverse chronological order.  The topics
meant to be merged to the maintenance series have "maint-" in their names.

If I have dropped anything recently its not because I don't want
to apply it, it just slipped through the cracks.  Please feel free
to give me a gentle prod (and a patch resend or a pointer to the
series on gmane).  Thanks.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* gb/gitweb-pathinfo (Mon Sep 29 17:26:57 2008 +0200) 4 commits
 - gitweb: generate parent..current URLs
 - gitweb: parse parent..current syntax from pathinfo
 - gitweb: generate project/action/hash URLs
 - gitweb: parse project/action/hash_base:filename PATH_INFO

This series just came in today.  I haven't had a chance to look at
it beyond stashing in `pu`.

* mw/sendemail (Mon Sep 29 12:41:06 2008 -0500) 8 commits
 - send-email: signedoffcc -> signedoffbycc, but handle both
 - Docs: send-email: Create logical groupings for man text
 - Docs: send-email: Remove unnecessary config variable description
 - Docs: send-email: --chain_reply_to -> --[no-]chain-reply-to
 - send-email: change --no-validate to boolean --[no-]validate
 - Docs: send-email: Man page option ordering
 - Docs: send-email usage text much sexier
 - Docs: send-email's usage text and man page mention same options

This series has already gone through 3 iterations before I could
start to carry it in-tree.  I haven't had a chance to read it yet
myself, so its sitting around in `pu` for futher review.

* pb/gitweb (Thu Sep 25 18:48:48 2008 +0200) 2 commits
 - gitweb: Sort the list of forks on the summary page by age
 - gitweb: Clean-up sorting of project list

I forgot to look at this series today.  I meant to review and try
to merge it to `next` before publishing.  Will do that tomorrow.

* ae/preservemerge (Tue Sep 23 22:58:20 2008 +0200) 3 commits
 - git pull: Support --preserve-merges as a flag to rebase
 - git rebase: Support non-interactive merge-preserving rebase
 - Prepare for non-interactive merge-preserving rebase

Andreas says there's some issues in here.  I'm waiting for a respin
on the series before I look at it futher.

* mg/verboseprune (Mon Sep 29 18:49:52 2008 +0200) 1 commit
 - make prune report removed objects on -v

Just came in today.  Looks sane.  I'll drop it onto `next` tomorrow.

[Old New Topics]

* nd/narrow (Sun Sep 14 20:07:59 2008 +0700) 9 commits
 - grep: skip files that have not been checked out
 - checkout_entry(): CE_NO_CHECKOUT on checked out entries.
 - Prevent diff machinery from examining worktree outside narrow
   checkout
 - Add tests for updating no-checkout entries in index
 - ls-files: add --narrow-checkout option to "will checkout" entries
 - update-index: add --checkout/--no-checkout to update
   CE_NO_CHECKOUT bit
 - update-index: refactor mark_valid() in preparation for new options
 - Introduce CE_NO_CHECKOUT bit
 - Extend index to save more flags

[jc: This is an early half of the earlier series (I haven't had
 chance to look at the updated series yet), and should be replaced
 with the updated one posted recently.]

I haven't touched this branch since I inherited it from Junio.
I'd appreciate a resend or a pointer to the updated series so I
can at least replace it.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Stalled -- Needs Action to Proceed (or to be dropped)]

* pb/submodule (Fri Sep 12 23:09:19 2008 +0200) 1 commit
 - t7400: Add short "git submodule add" testsuite

[jc: Waiting for a reroll.]

* bd/blame (Thu Aug 21 18:22:01 2008 -0500) 5 commits
 - Use xdiff caching to improve git blame performance
 - Allow xdiff machinery to cache hash results for a file
 - Always initialize xpparam_t to 0
 - Bypass textual patch generation and parsing in git blame
 - Allow alternate "low-level" emit function from xdl_diff

[jc: Réne had good comments on how the callback should be
 structured.]

* kb/am-directory (Fri Aug 29 15:27:50 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 - git-am: Pass the --directory option through to git-apply

[jc: I think this is still buggy and drops the option when am stops
 with conflicts.]

All three of these are stalled.  I'm not going to drop them just
yet, but Junio's comments still hold.  If there's no action on
these next week we may seem them drop off.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Will be merged to 'master/maint' soon]

* jc/add-ita (Thu Aug 21 01:44:53 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 + git-add --intent-to-add (-N)

Teaches "git add" to record only the intent to add a path later.
[jc: I rerolled this without the fake empty blob object.]

I'm inclined to merge this next week.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Actively Cooking]

* tr/workflow-doc (Sat Sep 13 18:11:01 2008 +0200) 2 commits
 + Documentation: Refer to git-rebase(1) to warn against rewriting
 + Documentation: new upstream rebase recovery section in git-rebase

[jc: My impression from the last round of discusson on the third
 patch in this series (not queued here) was that as long as we
 do not present it as "One True Workflow", the description was
 a good starting point, possibly others to add other recommended
 flows later.]

I haven't looked at this series yet.  Based on Junios remarks above
I'm looking for more input on this series before it goes anywhere.

* pb/commit-where (Mon Sep 8 01:05:41 2008 +0200) 1 commit
 + builtin-commit.c: show on which branch a commit was added

[jc: Tentatively kicked back to "still cooking" status after
 Jeff voiced his annoyance.  I personally do not like making this
 multi-line as Jeff suggested as an alternative (the message already
 is too verbose to my taste).]

Agree with Junio.  Hence its still here.

* lt/time-reject-fractional-seconds (Sat Aug 16 21:25:40 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 + date/time: do not get confused by fractional seconds

I need to look at this in more detail.  I suspect we can merge
this to master soon, but its been kicking around since Aug 16th.
I need to look at it to see if there's any obvious reason why Junio
has no notes on this branch and why it hasn't merged yet.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[On Hold]

* jc/post-simplify (Fri Aug 15 01:34:51 2008 -0700) 2 commits
 - revision --simplify-merges: incremental simplification
 - revision --simplify-merges: prepare for incremental simplification

[jc: I started making this incremental but the progress is not so great.]

* jc/stripspace (Sun Mar 9 00:30:35 2008 -0800) 6 commits
 - git-am --forge: add Signed-off-by: line for the author
 - git-am: clean-up Signed-off-by: lines
 - stripspace: add --log-clean option to clean up signed-off-by:
   lines
 - stripspace: use parse_options()
 - Add "git am -s" test
 - git-am: refactor code to add signed-off-by line for the committer

[jc: The one at second from the tip needs reworking.]

* jc/send-pack-tell-me-more (Thu Mar 20 00:44:11 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 - "git push": tellme-more protocol extension

* jc/merge-whitespace (Sun Feb 24 23:29:36 2008 -0800) 1 commit
 . WIP: start teaching the --whitespace=fix to merge machinery

This has a merge conflict with `next` and isn't even in pu right now.

* jc/blame (Wed Jun 4 22:58:40 2008 -0700) 2 commits
 - blame: show "previous" information in --porcelain/--incremental
   format
 - git-blame: refactor code to emit "porcelain format" output

I should look at this in more detail.  We may be able to merge it
to next soon-ish.

* sg/merge-options (Sun Apr 6 03:23:47 2008 +0200) 1 commit
 + merge: remove deprecated summary and diffstat options and config
   variables

[jc: This was previously in "will be in master soon" category,
 but it turns out that the synonyms to the ones this one deletes
 are fairly new invention that happend in 1.5.6 timeframe, and
 we cannot do this just yet.  Perhaps in 1.7.0, but with the loud
 whining about moving git-foo out of $PATH we have been hearing,
 it might not be a bad idea to drop this.]

* jk/renamelimit (Sat May 3 13:58:42 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 - diff: enable "too large a rename" warning when -M/-C is explicitly
   asked for

[jc: This would be the right thing to do for command line use,
 but gitk will be hit due to tcl/tk's limitation, so I am holding
 this back for now.]
