What's cooking in git.git (Dec 2022, #06; Sun, 18)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a future
release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and aren't
considered "accepted" at all.  A topic without enough support may be
discarded after a long period of no activity.

Looking at the list of topics slated for 'master' in this issue of
the report, we will probably have a big update to 'master' before
the Chrismas. But other than that, I expect things will be slow
towards the end of the year. Be good boys and girls, and enjoy
yourselves, everybody.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

 attempt to lazily attempt fetching an object that is expected to be
 commit, because no "filter" mode omits commit objects.  Take
 advantage of this assumption to fail fast on errors.
