What's cooking in git.git (Sep 2020, #05; Fri, 18)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'seen' (formerly 'pu'---proposed updates) while commits prefixed
with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches of the
repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

* al/t3200-back-on-a-branch (2020-09-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-09 at 833e2fc60c)
 + t3200: clean side effect of git checkout --orphan

 Test fix.


* ea/blame-use-oideq (2020-09-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-09 at babefe4727)
 + blame.c: replace instance of !oidcmp for oideq

 Code cleanup.


* es/wt-add-detach (2020-09-06) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-10 at abd83f90e7)
 + git-worktree.txt: discuss branch-based vs. throwaway worktrees
 + worktree: teach `add` to recognize -d as shorthand for --detach
 + git-checkout.txt: document -d short option for --detach

 "git worktree add" learns that the "-d" is a synonym to "--detach"
 option to create a new worktree without being on a branch.


* hn/refs-ref-log-only-bit (2020-09-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-09 at f729cb2c81)
 + refs: move REF_LOG_ONLY to refs-internal.h

 A bit of API reshuffling to make sure stuff common to all backends
 are not defined only in files backend.


* jc/add-i-use-builtin-experimental (2020-09-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-09 at abcb7515dc)
 + add -i: use the built-in version when feature.experimental is set

 The "add -i/-p" machinery has been written in C but it is not used
 by default yet.  It is made default to those who are participating
 in feature.experimental experiment.


* jc/dist-tarball-tweak (2020-09-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-10 at 36cbe7ee9e)
 + Makefile: allow extra tweaking of distribution tarball

 Allow maintainers to tweak $(TAR) invocations done while making
 distribution tarballs.


* jc/quote-path-cleanup (2020-09-10) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-10 at 3bfde81846)
 + quote: turn 'nodq' parameter into a set of flags
 + quote: rename misnamed sq_lookup[] to cq_lookup[]

 + quote_path: code clarification
 + quote_path: optionally allow quoting a path with SP in it
 + quote_path: give flags parameter to quote_path()
 + quote_path: rename quote_path_relative() to quote_path()

 "git status --short" quoted a path with SP in it when tracked, but
 not those that are untracked, ignored or unmerged.  They are all
 shown quoted consistently.


* jk/add-i-fixes (2020-09-08) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-09 at 46ea071a7a)
 + add--interactive.perl: specify --no-color explicitly
 + add-patch: fix inverted return code of repo_read_index()

 "add -i/-p" fixes.


* mf/submodule-summary-with-correct-repository (2020-06-24) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-10 at 7853fe7e12)
 + submodule: use submodule repository when preparing summary
 + revision: use repository from rev_info when parsing commits

 "git diff/show" on a change that involves a submodule used to read
 the information on commits in the submodule from a wrong repository
 and gave a wrong information when the commit-graph is involved.
 cf. <xmqqzh667ca4.fsf@gitster.c.googlers.com>


* mt/config-fail-nongit-early (2020-09-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-10 at 6f77f65b4e)
 + config: complain about --worktree outside of a git repo

 Unlike "git config --local", "git config --worktree" did not fail
 early and cleanly when started outside a git repository.


* os/collect-changed-submodules-optim (2020-09-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-10 at b6d9ed060e)

  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-09 at 4206d0503c)
 + add -p: fix memory leak

 Leakfix.


* rs/misc-cleanups (2020-09-06) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-09 at 4a19ea9672)
 + pack-bitmap-write: use hashwrite_be32() in write_hash_cache()
 + midx: use hashwrite_u8() in write_midx_header()
 + fast-import: use write_pack_header()

 Misc cleanups.


* rs/parallel-read-cache-fix (2020-09-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-09 at 92953a75c4)
 + read-cache: fix mem-pool allocation for multi-threaded index loading

 A follow-up fix to a topic already in 'master'.

  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-09 at 10741e90a5)
 + refspec: add and use refspec_appendf()
 + push: release strbufs used for refspec formatting

 Leakfix.


* so/log-tree-diff-cleanup (2020-09-06) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-09 at f8744b8e8a)

[New Topics]

* cs/don-t-pretend-a-failed-remote-set-head-succeeded (2020-09-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-18 at 51f73ca6dc)
 + remote: don't show success message when set-head fails

 "git remote set-head" that failed still said something that hints
 the operation went through, which was misleading.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* dl/diff-merge-base (2020-09-17) 10 commits
 - contrib/completion: complete `git diff --merge-base`
 - builtin/diff-tree: learn --merge-base
 - builtin/diff-index: learn --merge-base
 - t4068: add --merge-base tests
 - diff-lib: define diff_get_merge_base()
 - diff-lib: accept option flags in run_diff_index()
 - contrib/completion: extract common diff/difftool options
 - git-diff.txt: backtick quote command text
 - git-diff-index.txt: make --cached description a proper sentence
 - t4068: remove unnecessary >tmp

 "git diff A...B" learned "git diff --merge-base A B", which is a
 longer short-hand to say the same thing.

* jk/dont-count-existing-objects-twice (2020-09-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-18 at 73b30558b9)
 + packfile: actually set approximate_object_count_valid

 There is a logic to estimate how many objects are in the
 repository, which is mean to run once per process invocation, but
 it ran every time the estimated value was requested.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* dl/complete-format-patch-recent-features (2020-09-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-18 at c0ec1f7569)
 + contrib/completion: complete options that take refs for format-patch

 Update to command line completion (in contrib/)

 Will merge to 'master'.


* js/ignore-cmake-build-artifacts (2020-09-17) 1 commit
 - cmake: ignore generated files

 Running CMake based build with VS (in contrib/) from the top-level
 of the working tree leaves extra build crufts behind.  Add patterns
 to .gitignore

 Expecting a resolution in a better way.
 cf. <xmqq7dsrnjhi.fsf@gitster.c.googlers.com>
 It turns out that these crufts are visible only when the CMake
 based build procedure is used against the best practice.  A better
 alternative may be to prominently describe the recommended way to
 use the CMake-based build procedure.


* hx/push-atomic-with-cert (2020-09-18) 1 commit
 - send-pack: run GPG after atomic push checking

 "git push" that wants to be atomic and wants to send push
 certificate learned not to prepare and sign the push certificate
 when it fails the local check (hence due to atomicity it is known
 that no certificate is needed).

 Expecting a reroll.

* jc/war-on-dashed-git (2020-08-27) 1 commit
 - git: catch an attempt to run "git-foo"

 The first step to remove on-disk binaries for built-in subcommands
 by soliciting objections.

 On hold for now.


* dr/push-remoteref-fix (2020-04-23) 1 commit
 - remote.c: fix handling of %(push:remoteref)

 The "%(push:remoteref)" placeholder in the "--format=" argument of
 "git format-patch" (and friends) only showed what got explicitly
 configured, not what ref at the receiving end would be updated when
 "git push" was used, as it ignored the default behaviour (e.g. update
 the same ref as the source).

 Discard for now.

* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2018-10-15) 1 commit
 - zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-16 at b04e306660)
 + ref-filter: allow merged and no-merged filters
 + Doc: cover multiple contains/no-contains filters
 + t3201: test multiple branch filter combinations

 "git for-each-ref" and friends that list refs used to allow only
 one --merged or --no-merged to filter them; they learned to take
 combination of both kind of filtering.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* bc/faq-misc (2020-09-14) 3 commits
 - docs: explain how to deal with files that are always modified
 - docs: explain why reverts are not always applied on merge

* ar/fetch-ipversion-in-all (2020-09-15) 1 commit
 - fetch: pass --ipv4 and --ipv6 options to sub-fetches

 "git fetch --all --ipv4/--ipv6" forgot to pass the protocol options
 to instances of the "git fetch" that talk to individual remotes,
 which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.

* bc/clone-with-git-default-hash-fix (2020-09-15) 1 commit
 - builtin/clone: avoid failure with GIT_DEFAULT_HASH

 "git clone" that clones from SHA-1 repository, while
 GIT_DEFAULT_HASH set to use SHA-256 already, resulted in an
 unusable repository that half-claims to be SHA-256 repository
 with SHA-1 objects and refs.  This has been corrected.

 Expecting a reroll.


* cd/commit-graph-doc (2020-09-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-16 at b0816b6eb0)

 + mergetool: allow auto-merge for meld to follow the vim-diff behavior

 The 'meld' backend of the "git mergetool" learned to give the
 underlying 'meld' the '--auto-merge' option, which would help

* js/no-builtins-on-disk-option (2020-08-24) 3 commits
 - ci: stop linking built-ins to the dashed versions
 - install: optionally skip linking/copying the built-ins
 - msvc: copy the correct `.pdb` files in the Makefile target `install`

 The installation procedure learned to optionally omit "git-foo"
 executable files for each 'foo' built-in subcommand, which are only
 required by old timers that still rely on the age old promise that
 prepending "git --exec-path" output to PATH early in their script
 will keep the "git-foo" calls they wrote working.

 The old attempt to remove these executables from the disk failed in
 the 1.6 era; it may be worth attempting again, but I think it is
 worth to keep this topic separate from such a policy change to help
 it graduate early.

 Expecting a reroll to update log message for the last one.
 as it confused at least two reviewers.

 A "git gc"'s big brother has been introduced to take care of more
 repository maintenance tasks, not limited to the object database
 cleaning.

 Will merge to 'master'.
