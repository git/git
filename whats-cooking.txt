What's cooking in git.git (Aug 2008, #07; Sat, 23)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed
with '-' are only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are
in 'next'.

The topics list the commits in reverse chronological order.  The topics
meant to be merged to the maintenance series have "maint-" in their names.

Here is a list of issues/topics we saw on the mailing list but haven't
resulted in anything queuable in 'pu' yet.  They need further work by
interested parties:

 * Windows relocatable install

   Steffen Prohaska ($gmane/92605), Johannes Sixt.

 * Haiku port

   Andreas Färber ($gmane/92582)

 * ksh "trap foo EXIT" triggers on function return, loses exit status

   Brandon Casey ($gmane/92873)

 * document webdav debugging tip with davfs2

   Giovanni Funchal ($gmane/92745)

 * update "rebase -i" documentation with examples

   Eric Hanchrow ($gmane/92669)

 * pre-push hook

   Scott Chacon ($gmane/92900, $gmane/92936)

 * "git commit --author=nickname" expanding nickname from somewhere

   Michael J Gruber ($gmane/93274)

 * Handling (possibly $HOME-) relative paths in config files

   Karl Chen ($gmane/93250)

 * "submodule sync"

   David Aguilar ($gmane/93265)

 * "rev-list --bisect --first-parent"

   Avery Pennarun, me ($gmane/93420)

 * "apply --include"

   Joe Perches ($gmane/93505)

----------------------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* bd/blame (Thu Aug 21 18:22:01 2008 -0500) 5 commits
 . Use xdiff caching to improve git blame performance
 . Allow xdiff machinery to cache hash results for a file
 . Always initialize xpparam_t to 0
 . Bypass textual patch generation and parsing in git blame
 . Allow alternate "low-level" emit function from xdl_diff

Réne had a good comments on how the callback is structured.

* jc/maint-name-hash-clear (Sat Aug 23 13:05:10 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 - discard_cache: reset lazy name_hash bit

I spotted this by accident while working on something unrelated.

When a program calls discard_cache() to read the index again, we do not
properly re-initialize the name_hash structure that is used by the case
insensitivitly logic.  This _might_ improve issues people may be having on
case insensitive filesystems.  I dunno.

* mv/maint-merge-fix (Sat Aug 23 12:56:57 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 + merge: fix numerus bugs around "trivial merge" area

* ml/submodule (Thu Aug 21 19:54:01 2008 -0400) 2 commits
 + git-submodule.sh - Remove trailing / from URL if found
 + git-submodule.sh - Remove trailing / from URL if found

Soon to be in 'master', I guess.

* np/verify-pack (Fri Aug 22 15:45:53 2008 -0400) 1 commit
 + discard revindex data when pack list changes

* jc/add-ita (Thu Aug 21 01:44:53 2008 -0700) 3 commits
 - git-add --intent-to-add (-N)
 - cached_object: learn empty blob
 - sha1_object_info(): pay attention to cached objects

Teaches "git add" to record only the intent to add a path later.
I think this is better done without the hardcoded empty blob object.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Stalled -- Needs Action to Proceed (or to be dropped)]

* sb/daemon (Thu Aug 14 20:02:20 2008 +0200) 4 commits
 - git-daemon: rewrite kindergarden, new option --max-connections
 - git-daemon: Simplify dead-children reaping logic
 - git-daemon: use LOG_PID, simplify logging code
 - git-daemon: call logerror() instead of error()

Can somebody who actually runs the daemon standalone comment on this one?

* jc/cc-ld-dynpath (Sat Aug 16 15:01:23 2008 +0200) 2 commits
 - configure: auto detect dynamic library path switches
 - Makefile: Allow CC_LD_DYNPATH to be overriden

Needs success reports from people who do use user-defined dynamic library
path when they build their "git" before this series can go anywhere.

* lt/time-reject-fractional-seconds (Sat Aug 16 21:25:40 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 - date/time: do not get confused by fractional seconds

Linus hints further enhancements as "the right way", so let's see if
somebody else steps up and tries it before merging this to 'next'.

* sp/smart-http (Sun Aug 3 00:25:17 2008 -0700) 2 commits
 - [do not merge -- original version] Add Git-aware CGI for Git-aware
   smart HTTP transport
 - Add backdoor options to receive-pack for use in Git-aware CGI

The "magic" detection protocol was revised to use POST to info/refs; the
top one queued is from before that discussion.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Actively Cooking]

* cc/bisect (Fri Aug 22 05:52:29 2008 +0200) 2 commits
 - bisect: only check merge bases when needed
 - bisect: test merge base if good rev is not an ancestor of bad rev

* mv/merge-recursive (Tue Aug 12 22:14:00 2008 +0200) 3 commits
 . Make builtin-revert.c use merge_recursive_generic()
 . merge-recursive.c: Add more generic merge_recursive_generic()
 . Split out merge_recursive() to merge-recursive.c

Miklos will be working on updates based on comments.

* lw/gitweb (Mon Aug 18 21:39:49 2008 +0200) 3 commits
 . gitweb: use new Git::Repo API, and add optional caching
 . add new Perl API: Git::Repo, Git::Commit, Git::Tag, and
   Git::RepoRoot
 . gitweb: add test suite with Test::WWW::Mechanize::CGI

Tentatively dropped as its tests do not seem to pass and I have no time to
look at them.

* jc/diff-prefix (Mon Aug 18 20:08:09 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 - diff: vary default prefix depending on what are compared

As some people may have noticed, I've been running with this one when
sending out "How about this" patches to the discussion threads.

* sp/missing-thin-base (Tue Aug 12 11:31:06 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 + pack-objects: Allow missing base objects when creating thin packs

* tr/filter-branch (Tue Aug 12 10:45:59 2008 +0200) 3 commits
 + filter-branch: use --simplify-merges
 + filter-branch: fix ref rewriting with --subdirectory-filter
 + filter-branch: Extend test to show rewriting bug

Fixes a longstanding filter branch bug.  Success stories?

* jc/post-simplify (Fri Aug 15 01:34:51 2008 -0700) 8 commits
 - revision --simplify-merges: incremental simplification
 - revision --simplify-merges: prepare for incremental simplification
 - revision --simplify-merges: make it a no-op without pathspec
 + revision --simplify-merges: do not leave commits unprocessed
 + revision --simplify-merges: use decoration instead of commit->util
   field
 + Topo-sort before --simplify-merges
 + revision traversal: show full history with merge simplification
 + revision.c: whitespace fix

"log --full-history" is with too much clutter, "log" itself is too cleverer
than some people, and here is the middle level of merge simplification.

I started making this incremental but the progress is not so great.

* tr/rev-list-docs (Tue Aug 12 01:55:37 2008 +0200) 1 commit
 + Documentation: rev-list-options: move --simplify-merges
   documentation

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Will merge to master soon]

* jc/no-slim-shell (Tue Aug 19 18:05:43 2008 -0700) 2 commits
 + Build-in "git-shell"
 + shell: do not play duplicated definition games to shrink the
   executable

* mv/merge-custom (Sat Aug 23 19:23:22 2008 -0700) 9 commits
 + t7606: fix custom merge test
 + Fix "git-merge -s bogo" help text
 + Update .gitignore to ignore git-help
 + Builtin git-help.
 + builtin-help: always load_command_list() in cmd_help()
 + Add a second testcase for handling invalid strategies in git-merge
 + Add a new test for using a custom merge strategy
 + builtin-merge: allow using a custom strategy
 + builtin-help: make some internal functions available to other
   builtins

The one at the tip fixes a test that assumed git-merge has a broken
"trivial merge" implementation.

* jc/add-addremove (Tue Jul 22 22:30:40 2008 -0700) 2 commits
 + builtin-add.c: optimize -A option and "git add ."
 + builtin-add.c: restructure the code for maintainability

* am/cherry-pick-rerere (Sun Aug 10 17:18:55 2008 +0530) 1 commit
 + Make cherry-pick use rerere for conflict resolution.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[On Hold]

* jc/stripspace (Sun Mar 9 00:30:35 2008 -0800) 6 commits
 - git-am --forge: add Signed-off-by: line for the author
 - git-am: clean-up Signed-off-by: lines
 - stripspace: add --log-clean option to clean up signed-off-by:
   lines
 - stripspace: use parse_options()
 - Add "git am -s" test
 - git-am: refactor code to add signed-off-by line for the committer

* jc/send-pack-tell-me-more (Thu Mar 20 00:44:11 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 - "git push": tellme-more protocol extension

* jc/merge-whitespace (Sun Feb 24 23:29:36 2008 -0800) 1 commit
 - WIP: start teaching the --whitespace=fix to merge machinery

* jc/blame (Wed Jun 4 22:58:40 2008 -0700) 2 commits
 - blame: show "previous" information in --porcelain/--incremental
   format
 - git-blame: refactor code to emit "porcelain format" output

* sg/merge-options (Sun Apr 6 03:23:47 2008 +0200) 1 commit
 + merge: remove deprecated summary and diffstat options and config
   variables

This was previously in "will be in master soon" category, but it turns out
that the synonyms to the ones this one deletes are fairly new invention
that happend in 1.5.6 timeframe, and we cannot do this just yet.  Perhaps
in 1.7.0.

* jc/dashless (Wed Jun 25 15:55:11 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 - Make clients ask for "git program" over ssh and local transport

This is the "botched" one.  Will be resurrected during 1.7.0 or 1.8.0
timeframe.

* jk/renamelimit (Sat May 3 13:58:42 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 - diff: enable "too large a rename" warning when -M/-C is explicitly
   asked for

This would be the right thing to do for command line use, but gitk will be
hit due to tcl/tk's limitation, so I am holding this back for now.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* ml/submodule-foreach (Sun Aug 10 19:10:04 2008 -0400) 1 commit
 + git-submodule - Add 'foreach' subcommand

* pm/log-exit-code (Mon Aug 11 08:46:25 2008 +0200) 2 commits
 + Teach git log --exit-code to return an appropriate exit code
 + Teach git log --check to return an appropriate exit code

* sb/commit-tree-minileak (Tue Aug 12 00:35:11 2008 +0200) 1 commit
 + Fix commit_tree() buffer leak

* pb/reflog-dwim (Sun Aug 10 22:22:21 2008 +0200) 1 commit
 + builtin-reflog: Allow reflog expire to name partial ref

* jc/add-stop-at-symlink (Mon Aug 4 00:52:37 2008 -0700) 2 commits
 + add: refuse to add working tree items beyond symlinks
 + update-index: refuse to add working tree items beyond symlinks

Fix for a longstanding bug that allows "git add" and "git update-index" to
add a path "a/b" to the index when "a" is a symbolic link.  We would need
a similar fix for the case where "a" is a submodule.

* kh/diff-tree (Sun Aug 10 18:13:04 2008 +0200) 4 commits
 + Add test for diff-tree --stdin with two trees
 + Teach git diff-tree --stdin to diff trees
 + diff-tree: Note that the commit ID is printed with --stdin
 + Refactoring: Split up diff_tree_stdin

* mg/count-objects (Fri Aug 15 00:20:20 2008 -0400) 1 commit
 + count-objects: Add total pack size to verbose output

This one is without the human readable bits.

* mz/push-verbose (Sat Aug 16 19:58:32 2008 +0200) 1 commit
 + Make push more verbose about illegal combination of options

* jc/index-extended-flags (Sat Aug 16 23:02:08 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 + index: future proof for "extended" index entries

* cc/merge-base-many (Sun Jul 27 13:47:22 2008 -0700) 4 commits
 + git-merge-octopus: use (merge-base A (merge B C D E...)) for
   stepwise merge
 + merge-base-many: add trivial tests based on the documentation
 + documentation: merge-base: explain "git merge-base" with more than
   2 args
 + merge-base: teach "git merge-base" to drive underlying
   merge_bases_many()

* js/parallel-test (Mon Aug 18 12:25:40 2008 -0400) 4 commits
 + Update t/.gitignore to ignore all trash directories
 + Enable parallel tests
 + tests: Clarify dependencies between tests, 'aggregate-results' and
   'clean'
 + t9700: remove useless check

* jc/test-deeper (Fri Aug 8 02:26:28 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 + tests: use $TEST_DIRECTORY to refer to the t/ directory

This does not actually move "t/test directory" any deeper, but fixes test
scripts that assume they run immediately below "t/" to use TEST_DIRECTORY
variable.

* js/mingw-stat (Mon Aug 18 22:01:06 2008 +0200) 2 commits
 + Revert "Windows: Use a customized struct stat that also has the
   st_blocks member."
 + compat: introduce on_disk_bytes()

This gets rid of use of st_blocks member (which is XSI but not POSIX
proper), which was originally prompted by recent Haiku port but it turns
out MinGW has the same issue as well.  Queued on 'pu' just to have a
chance to make sure I munged the version j6t sent me correctly before
merging it upwards.

* js/checkout-dwim-local (Sat Aug 9 16:00:12 2008 +0200) 1 commit
 + checkout --track: make up a sensible branch name if '-b' was
   omitted

Alex has update to dwim "checkout --track remotes/origin/hack" as well.

* bd/diff-strbuf (Wed Aug 13 23:18:22 2008 -0700) 3 commits
 + xdiff-interface: hide the whole "xdiff_emit_state" business from
   the caller
 + Use strbuf for struct xdiff_emit_state's remainder
 + Make xdi_diff_outf interface for running xdiff_outf diffs

Gives measurable performance improvement to textual diff generation.  For
improving "blame" performance, it might be more effective to hook directly
to lower level of xdiff machinery so that we do not even have to generate
patch only to discard after reading "@@ -l,k +m,n @@" lines, but that
would be a separate topic.

* dp/hash-literally (Sun Aug 3 18:36:22 2008 +0400) 6 commits
 + add --no-filters option to git hash-object
 + add --path option to git hash-object
 + use parse_options() in git hash-object
 + correct usage help string for git-hash-object
 + correct argument checking test for git hash-object
 + teach index_fd to work with pipes

Gives a bit more flexibility to hash-objects by allowing us to lie about
the path the contents comes from.

* rs/imap (Wed Jul 9 22:29:02 2008 +0100) 5 commits
 + Documentation: Improve documentation for git-imap-send(1)
 + imap-send.c: more style fixes
 + imap-send.c: style fixes
 + git-imap-send: Support SSL
 + git-imap-send: Allow the program to be run from subdirectories of
   a git tree

Some people seem to prefer having this feature available also with gnutls.
Such an enhancement can be done in-tree on top of this series if they are
so inclined.

* jk/pager-swap (Tue Jul 22 03:14:12 2008 -0400) 2 commits
 + spawn pager via run_command interface
 + run-command: add pre-exec callback

This changes the parent-child relationship between the pager and the git
process.  We used to make pager the parent which meant that the exit
status from git is lost from the caller.

* ph/enable-threaded (Mon Jul 21 11:23:43 2008 +0200) 1 commit
 + Enable threaded delta search on *BSD and Linux.
