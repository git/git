What's cooking in git.git (Oct 2014, #02; Thu, 9)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* bw/use-write-script-in-tests (2014-09-29) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-29 at be4056e)

 + receive-pack: parse feature request a bit earlier
 + receive-pack: do not overallocate command structure
 (this branch is used by jc/push-cert-hmac-optim.)

 Allow "git push" request to be signed, so that it can be verified and
 audited, using the GPG signature of the person who pushed, that the
 tips of branches at a public repository really point the commits
 the pusher wanted to, without having to "trust" the server.


* nd/archive-pathspec (2014-09-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-25 at 8806f93)
 + archive: support filtering paths with glob

 "git archive" learned to filter what gets archived with pathspec.


* sp/stream-clean-filter (2014-09-22) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-29 at 47fc36d)
 + sha1_file: don't convert off_t to size_t too early to avoid potential die()
 + convert: stream from fd to required clean filter to reduce used address space
 + copy_fd(): do not close the input file descriptor
 + mmap_limit: introduce GIT_MMAP_LIMIT to allow testing expected mmap size
 + memory_limit: use git_env_ulong() to parse GIT_ALLOC_LIMIT
 + config.c: add git_env_ulong() to parse environment variable
 + convert: drop arguments other than 'path' from would_convert_to_git()

 When running a required clean filter, we do not have to mmap the
 original before feeding the filter.  Instead, stream the file
 contents directly to the filter and process its output.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* mh/lockfile-stdio (2014-10-01) 3 commits

* jc/completion-no-chdir (2014-10-09) 1 commit
 - completion: use "git -C $there" instead of (cd $there && git ...)

 Seems to break t9902; we may want to use $gmane/258099 or something
 like that in the meantime, but on the other hand the topic itself
 is not that urgent.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* rs/ref-transaction (2014-09-10) 19 commits
 . ref_transaction_commit: bail out on failure to remove a ref

 "log -p" output learns a new way to let users inspect a merge
 commit by showing the differences between the automerged result
 with conflicts the person who recorded the merge would have seen
 and the final conflict resolution that was recorded in the merge.

 Waiting for a reroll ($gmane/256591).

 - t9903: move test name prefix to a separate variable
 - t9903: put the Bash pc mode prompt test cases in a function
 - t9903: remove Zsh test from the suite of Bash prompt tests

 Expecting a reroll to limit the damage to test_eval_; also reported
 to be broken with older zsh that are still in the field ($gmane/251231).


* ss/userdiff-update-csharp-java (2014-06-02) 2 commits
 - userdiff: support Java try keyword
 - userdiff: support C# async methods and correct C# keywords

 Reviews sent; waiting for a response.


* bg/rebase-off-of-previous-branch (2014-04-16) 1 commit
 - git-rebase: print name of rev when using shorthand

 Teach "git rebase -" to report the concrete name of the branch
 (i.e. the previous one).

 But it stops short and does not do the same for "git rebase @{-1}".
 Expecting a reroll.


* jk/makefile (2014-02-05) 16 commits
 . FIXUP
 . move LESS/LV pager environment to Makefile
 . Makefile: teach scripts to include make variables
 . FIXUP

 . Makefile: use tempfile/mv strategy for GIT-*
 . Makefile: introduce make-var helper function
 . Makefile: fix git-instaweb dependency on gitweb
 . Makefile: drop USE_GETTEXT_SCHEME from GIT-CFLAGS

 Simplify the Makefile rules and macros that exist primarily for
 quoting purposes, and make it easier to robustly express the
 dependency rules.

 Expecting a reroll.


* rb/merge-prepare-commit-msg-hook (2014-01-10) 4 commits
 - merge: drop unused arg from abort_commit method signature
 - merge: make prepare_to_commit responsible for write_merge_state
 - t7505: ensure cleanup after hook blocks merge
 - t7505: add missing &&

 Expose more merge states (e.g. $GIT_DIR/MERGE_MODE) to hooks that
 run during "git merge".  The log message stresses too much on one
 hook, prepare-commit-msg, but it would equally apply to other hooks
 like post-merge, I think.

 Waiting for a reroll.


* jc/graph-post-root-gap (2013-12-30) 3 commits
 - WIP: document what we want at the end
 - graph: remove unused code a bit
 - graph: stuff the current commit into graph->columns[]

 - perf-lib: add test_perf_cleanup target
 - perf-lib: split starting the test from the execution

 Add test_perf_cleanup shell function to the perf suite, that allows
 the script writers to define a test with a clean-up action.

 Will hold.


* jc/show-branch (2014-03-24) 5 commits
 - show-branch: use commit slab to represent bitflags of arbitrary width
 - show-branch.c: remove "all_mask"

 - show-branch.c: lift all_mask/all_revs to a global static
 - show-branch.c: update comment style

 Waiting for the final step to lift the hard-limit before sending it out.

[Cooking]

  (merged to 'next' on 2014-10-07 at 923bd93)
 + t0090: avoid passing empty string to printf %d
 (this branch is used by jk/prune-mtime.)

 This fixes a topic that has graduated to 'master'.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* bw/trace-no-inline-getnanotime (2014-09-29) 1 commit
 - trace.c: do not mark getnanotime() as "inline"

 No file-scope static variables in an inlined function, please.

 - Make 'git help everyday' work
 - doc: Makefile regularise OBSOLETE_HTML list building
 - doc: modernise everyday.txt wording and format in man page style

 Looks ready for 'next' except for minor nits.


* jc/push-cert-hmac-optim (2014-09-25) 2 commits
 - receive-pack: truncate hmac early and convert only necessary bytes
 - sha1_to_hex: split out "hex-format n bytes" helper and use it

 This is "we could do this if we wanted to", not "we measured and it
 improves performance critical codepath".

 Will perhaps drop.


* je/quiltimport-no-fuzz (2014-09-26) 2 commits
 - git-quiltimport: flip the default not to allow fuzz
 - git-quiltimport.sh: allow declining fuzz with --exact option

 "quiltimport" drove "git apply" always with -C1 option to reduce
 context of the patch in order to give more chance to somewhat stale
 patches to apply.  Add an "--exact" option to disable, and also
 "-C$n" option to customize this behaviour.  The top patch
 optionally flips the default to "--exact".

 Waiting for an Ack.


* so/rebase-doc-fork-point (2014-09-29) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-10-07 at 03d8ed6)
 + Documentation/git-rebase.txt: document when --fork-point is auto-enabled

 Will merge to 'master'.

 Code clean-up.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 A replacement for contrib/workdir/git-new-workdir that does not
 rely on symbolic links and make sharing of objects and refs safer
 by making the borrowee and borrowers aware of each other.

 A few tests need some tweaks for MinGW ($gmane/{257756,257757}).


* cc/interpret-trailers (2014-09-22) 11 commits
 - Documentation: add documentation for 'git interpret-trailers'

 A new filter to programatically edit the tail end of the commit log
 messages.

 Discussion on the topic with Michael Tsirkin who wants to utilize
 this machinery is going on.  Finally a real functionality review
 that is very much welcomed.


* mt/patch-id-stable (2014-06-10) 1 commit
 - patch-id: change default to stable

 Teaches "git patch-id" to compute the patch ID that does not change
 when the files in a single patch is reordered. As this new algorithm
 is backward incompatible, the last bit to flip it to be the default
 is left out of 'master' for now.

 Nobody seems to be jumping up & down requesting this last step,
 which makes the result somewhat backward incompatible.
 Will perhaps drop.

--------------------------------------------------
[Discarded]

* rr/mergetool-temporary-filename-tweak (2014-08-21) 1 commit
 . Allow the user to change the temporary file name for mergetool

 Needed rerolling (new paragraph in doc seems to be in a wrong place)
 for quite some time but without any activity.
