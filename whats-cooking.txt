What's cooking in git.git (Sep 2014, #09; Tue, 30)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.

Many fixes on the 'master' has been merged down to 'maint' and the
tip of the latter is at v2.1.2 now.  Among the topics that have been
cooking in 'next', easier ones have all graduated to 'master'.

During the remainder of this cycle, I would like to see these topics
to be in 'master' by the end of the 8th week in late October:

 - ref transaction updates by Ronnie and Jonathan
 - lockfile updates by Michael
 - replacement for contrib/workdir by Duy

All of them are of rather nontrivial size, and would need to be in
'next' for at least a few weeks, which would mean they must be in a
good enough shape to go incremental by mid October.  I suspect that
we might be cutting it a bit too close for some of them but we'll
see.

    Side note: I am not saying that I will ignore other topics; I am
    just saying that I care about these three topics because their
    changes have large impact on the current codebase, and they have
    big positive impact on the future when done right.  We want to
    see atomic updates to multiple refs.  We want to see our locks
    behave sensibly.  We want to see safer way to work with multiple
    working trees checked out of a single repository.

    Other topics in flight are of smaller impact that I would not
    worry too much about and tend to require less brainpower to
    judge if the design is good, and I'd be happy to see them go
    through the usual 'pu' to 'next' to 'master' with their own
    pace, either by the end of this cycle, extending into the next
    cycle---in that sense I do not care too much about them to
    single any out.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

[New Topics]

* dt/cache-tree-repair (2014-09-30) 1 commit
 - t0090: avoid passing empty string to printf %d

 This fixes a topic that has graduated to 'master'.
 Will merge to 'next'.

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* jc/test-lazy-prereq (2014-06-13) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-25 at ed479f3)
 + tests: drop GIT_*_TIMING_TESTS environment variable support

 Test-script clean-up.


* jt/itimer-autoconf (2014-08-29) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-25 at efd65ba)
 + autoconf: check for setitimer()
 + autoconf: check for struct itimerval
 + git-compat-util.h: add missing semicolon after struct itimerval
 (this branch is used by jt/timer-settime.)

 setitmer(2) and related API elements can be configured from
 Makefile but autoconf did not know about it.


* pr/use-default-sigpipe-setting (2014-09-22) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-24 at 2d678ed)
 + mingw.h: add dummy functions for sigset_t operations
 + unblock and unignore SIGPIPE

 We used to get confused when a process called us with SIGPIPE
 ignored; we do want to die with SIGPIPE when the output is not
 read by default, and do ignore the signal when appropriate.


* sb/merge-recursive-copy-paste-fix (2014-09-23) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-24 at b8dfbef)
 + merge-recursive: remove stale commented debugging code
 + merge-recursive: fix copy-paste mistake

 "git merge-recursive" had a small bug that could have made it
 mishandle "one side deleted, the other side did not touch it" in a
 rare corner case, where the other side actually did touch to cause
 the blob object names to be different but both blobs before and
 after the change normalize to the same (e.g. correcting mistake to
 check in a blob with CRLF line endings by replacing it with another
 blob that records the same contents with LF line endings).

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* rs/ref-transaction (2014-09-12) 20 commits
 . remote rm/prune: print a message when writing packed-refs fails
 . ref_transaction_commit: bail out on failure to remove a ref
 . lockfile: remove unable_to_lock_error
 . refs.c: do not permit err == NULL

 . refs.c: move the check for valid refname to lock_ref_sha1_basic
 . rename_ref: don't ask read_ref_full where the ref came from
 . refs.c: pass the ref log message to _create/delete/update instead of _commit
 . refs.c: add an err argument to delete_ref_loose
 . wrapper.c: add a new function unlink_or_msg
 . wrapper.c: remove/unlink_or_warn: simplify, treat ENOENT as success
 . mv test: recreate mod/ directory instead of relying on stale copy

 Rerolled and was asked to wait.  Seems to break HEAD reflog
 upon "checkout HEAD^0".

 Expecting another reroll.


* tr/remerge-diff (2014-09-08) 8 commits
 - log --remerge-diff: show what the conflict resolution changed
 - name-hash: allow dir hashing even when !ignore_case
 - merge-recursive: allow storing conflict hunks in index

 - merge-recursive: -Xindex-only to leave worktree unchanged
 - merge-recursive: internal flag to avoid touching the worktree
 - merge-recursive: remove dead conditional in update_stages()

 "log -p" output learns a new way to let users inspect a merge
 commit by showing the differences between the automerged result
 with conflicts the person who recorded the merge would have seen
 and the final conflict resolution that was recorded in the merge.

 Waiting for a reroll ($gmane/256591).


* hv/submodule-config (2014-06-30) 4 commits
 - do not die on error of parsing fetchrecursesubmodules option
 - use new config API for worktree configurations of submodules
 - extract functions for submodule config set and lookup
 - implement submodule config cache for lookup of submodule names

 Kicked back to 'pu' per request ($gmane/255610).


* jt/timer-settime (2014-08-29) 6 commits
 - use timer_settime() for new platforms
 - autoconf: check for timer_settime()
 - autoconf: check for struct itimerspec
 - autoconf: check for struct sigevent

 - pack-bitmap: do not use gcc packed attribute

 Hold, waiting for Karsten's replacement.


* cb/mergetool-difftool (2014-07-21) 2 commits
 - difftool: don't assume that default sh is sane
 - mergetool: don't require a work tree for --tool-help

 Update the way the "difftool --help" shows the help message that is
 shared with the "mergetool" to reduce one shell dependency.

 Will be rerolled.


* rr/mergetool-temporary-filename-tweak (2014-08-21) 1 commit
 - Allow the user to change the temporary file name for mergetool

 Needs rerolling (new paragraph in doc seems to be in a wrong place)


* jk/tag-contains (2014-06-30) 8 commits
 . perf: add tests for tag --contains
 . tag: use commit_contains
 . commit: provide a fast multi-tip contains function
 . string-list: add pos to iterator callback
 . add functions for memory-efficient bitmaps
 . paint_down_to_common: use prio_queue
 . tag: factor out decision to stream tags
 . tag: allow --sort with -n

 Expecting a reroll.


* ab/add-interactive-show-diff-func-name (2014-05-12) 2 commits
 - SQUASH??? git-add--interactive: Preserve diff heading when splitting hunks
 - git-add--interactive: Preserve diff heading when splitting hunks

 Waiting for a reroll.


* jn/gitweb-utf8-in-links (2014-05-27) 1 commit
 - gitweb: Harden UTF-8 handling in generated links

 $gmane/250758?


* rh/prompt-tests (2014-06-05) 11 commits
 - t9904: new __git_ps1 tests for Zsh
 - test-lib: make it possible to override how test code is eval'd
 - lib-prompt-tests.sh: add variable for string that encodes percent in PS1

 - t9903: move prompt tests to a new lib-prompt-tests.sh file
 - t9903: move PS1 color code variable definitions to lib-bash.sh
 - t9903: include "Bash" in test names via new $shellname var
 - t9903: run pc mode tests again with PS1 expansion disabled
 - t9903: move test name prefix to a separate variable
 - t9903: put the Bash pc mode prompt test cases in a function
 - t9903: remove Zsh test from the suite of Bash prompt tests

 Expecting a reroll to limit the damage to test_eval_; also reported
 to be broken with older zsh that are still in the field ($gmane/251231).


* ss/userdiff-update-csharp-java (2014-06-02) 2 commits
 - userdiff: support Java try keyword
 - userdiff: support C# async methods and correct C# keywords

 Reviews sent; waiting for a response.


* bg/rebase-off-of-previous-branch (2014-04-16) 1 commit
 - git-rebase: print name of rev when using shorthand

 Teach "git rebase -" to report the concrete name of the branch
 (i.e. the previous one).

 But it stops short and does not do the same for "git rebase @{-1}".
 Expecting a reroll.


* jk/makefile (2014-02-05) 16 commits
 . FIXUP
 . move LESS/LV pager environment to Makefile
 . Makefile: teach scripts to include make variables
 . FIXUP
 . Makefile: auto-build C strings from make variables
 . Makefile: drop *_SQ variables
 . FIXUP
 . Makefile: add c-quote helper function
 . Makefile: introduce sq function for shell-quoting
 . Makefile: always create files via make-var
 . Makefile: store GIT-* sentinel files in MAKE/
 . Makefile: prefer printf to echo for GIT-*
 . Makefile: use tempfile/mv strategy for GIT-*
 . Makefile: introduce make-var helper function
 . Makefile: fix git-instaweb dependency on gitweb
 . Makefile: drop USE_GETTEXT_SCHEME from GIT-CFLAGS

 Simplify the Makefile rules and macros that exist primarily for
 quoting purposes, and make it easier to robustly express the
 dependency rules.

 Expecting a reroll.


* rb/merge-prepare-commit-msg-hook (2014-01-10) 4 commits
 - merge: drop unused arg from abort_commit method signature
 - merge: make prepare_to_commit responsible for write_merge_state
 - t7505: ensure cleanup after hook blocks merge
 - t7505: add missing &&

 Expose more merge states (e.g. $GIT_DIR/MERGE_MODE) to hooks that
 run during "git merge".  The log message stresses too much on one
 hook, prepare-commit-msg, but it would equally apply to other hooks
 like post-merge, I think.

 Waiting for a reroll.


* jc/graph-post-root-gap (2013-12-30) 3 commits
 - WIP: document what we want at the end
 - graph: remove unused code a bit
 - graph: stuff the current commit into graph->columns[]

 This was primarily a RFH ($gmane/239580).


* tg/perf-lib-test-perf-cleanup (2013-09-19) 2 commits
 - perf-lib: add test_perf_cleanup target
 - perf-lib: split starting the test from the execution

 Add test_perf_cleanup shell function to the perf suite, that allows
 the script writers to define a test with a clean-up action.

 Will hold.


* jc/show-branch (2014-03-24) 5 commits
 - show-branch: use commit slab to represent bitflags of arbitrary width
 - show-branch.c: remove "all_mask"
 - show-branch.c: abstract out "flags" operation
 - show-branch.c: lift all_mask/all_revs to a global static
 - show-branch.c: update comment style

 Waiting for the final step to lift the hard-limit before sending it out.

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* bw/use-write-script-in-tests (2014-09-29) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-29 at be4056e)
 + t/lib-credential: use write_script

 Will merge to 'master'.


* bw/trace-no-inline-getnanotime (2014-09-29) 1 commit
 - trace.c: do not mark getnanotime() as "inline"

 No file-scope static variables in an inlined function, please.


* po/everyday-doc (2014-09-29) 3 commits
 - Make 'git help everyday' work
 - doc: Makefile regularise OBSOLETE_HTML list building
 - doc: modernise everyday.txt wording and format in man page style

 Looks ready for 'next' except for minor nits.


* jc/push-cert-hmac-optim (2014-09-25) 2 commits
 - receive-pack: truncate hmac early and convert only necessary bytes
 - sha1_to_hex: split out "hex-format n bytes" helper and use it
 (this branch uses jc/push-cert.)

 This is "we could do this if we wanted to", not "we measured and it
 improves performance critical codepath".

 Will perhaps drop.


* je/quiltimport-no-fuzz (2014-09-26) 2 commits
 - git-quiltimport: flip the default not to allow fuzz
 - git-quiltimport.sh: allow declining fuzz with --exact option

 "quiltimport" drove "git apply" always with -C1 option to reduce
 context of the patch in order to give more chance to somewhat stale
 patches to apply.  Add an "--exact" option to disable, and also
 "-C$n" option to customize this behaviour.  The top patch
 optionally flips the default to "--exact".

 Waiting for an Ack.


* nd/archive-pathspec (2014-09-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-25 at 8806f93)
 + archive: support filtering paths with glob

 "git archive" learned to filter what gets archived with pathspec.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* so/rebase-doc-fork-point (2014-09-29) 1 commit
 - Documentation/git-rebase.txt: document when --fork-point is auto-enabled

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sk/tag-contains-wo-recursion (2014-09-23) 1 commit
 - t7004: give the test a bit more stack space

 Waiting for an Ack ($gmane/257448).


* da/include-compat-util-first-in-c (2014-09-15) 4 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - check-headers: add header usage checks for .c files
 - Makefile: add check-headers target
 - cleanups: ensure that git-compat-util.h is included first

 So... what is happening to this topic?  I think the bottom one is a
 reasonable clean-up without too much churn, but I am not sure about
 the rest.

 by making the borrowee and borrowers aware of each other.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* cc/interpret-trailers (2014-09-22) 11 commits
 - Documentation: add documentation for 'git interpret-trailers'
 - trailer: add tests for commands in config file
 - trailer: execute command from 'trailer.<name>.command'
 - trailer: add tests for "git interpret-trailers"
 - trailer: add interpret-trailers command

 A new filter to programatically edit the tail end of the commit log
 messages.

 Discussion on the topic with Michael Tsirkin who wants to utilize
 this machinery is going on.  Finally a real functionality review

 contents directly to the filter and process its output.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/push-cert (2014-09-25) 24 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-25 at 3eb1d69)
 + receive-pack::hmac_sha1(): copy the entire SHA-1 hash out
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-24 at a99f5d8)

 audited, using the GPG signature of the person who pushed, that the
 tips of branches at a public repository really point the commits
 the pusher wanted to, without having to "trust" the server.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* mt/patch-id-stable (2014-06-10) 1 commit
 - patch-id: change default to stable

 Teaches "git patch-id" to compute the patch ID that does not change
 when the files in a single patch is reordered. As this new algorithm
 is backward incompatible, the last bit to flip it to be the default
 is left out of 'master' for now.

 Nobody seems to be jumping up & down requesting this last step,
 which makes the result somewhat backward incompatible.
 Will perhaps drop.
