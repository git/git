What's cooking in git.git (Apr 2019, #01; Thu, 4)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

[Graduated to "master"]

* ab/makefile-help-devs-more (2019-02-24) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-03-11 at 898f5f44bc)
 + Makefile: allow for combining DEVELOPER=1 and CFLAGS="..."
 + Makefile: move the setting of *FLAGS closer to "include"
 + Makefile: Move *_LIBS assignment into its own section
 + Makefile: add/remove comments at top and tweak whitespace
 + Makefile: move "strip" assignment down from flags
 + Makefile: remove an out-of-date comment

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2019-03-07

 CFLAGS now can be tweaked when invoking Make while using
 DEVELOPER=YesPlease; this did not work well before.


* br/commit-tree-parseopt (2019-03-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-03-11 at e1228ef04f)
 + commit-tree: utilize parse-options api

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2019-03-08

 The command line parser of "git commit-tree" has been rewritten to
 use the parse-options API.


* jk/bisect-final-output (2019-03-01) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-03-11 at dea599eb04)
 + bisect: make diff-tree output prettier
 + bisect: fix internal diff-tree config loading
 + bisect: use string arguments to feed internal diff-tree

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2019-03-07

 The final report from "git bisect" used to show the suspected
 culprit using a raw "diff-tree", with which there is no output for
 a merge commit.  This has been updated to use a more modern and
 human readable output that still is concise enough.


* jk/config-type-color-ends-with-lf (2019-03-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-03-11 at 810b269d1a)
 + config: document --type=color output is a complete line

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2019-03-07

 "git config --type=color ..." is meant to replace "git config --get-color"
 but there is a slight difference that wasn't documented, which is
 now fixed.


* jk/fsck-doc (2019-03-05) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-03-11 at 5cd610f73e)
 + fsck: always compute USED flags for unreachable objects
 + doc/fsck: clarify --connectivity-only behavior

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2019-03-07

 "git fsck --connectivity-only" omits computation necessary to sift
 the objects that are not reachable from any of the refs into
 unreachable and dangling.  This is now enabled when dangling
 objects are requested (which is done by default, but can be
 overridden with the "--no-dangling" option).


* jk/no-sigpipe-during-network-transport (2019-03-05) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-03-11 at 25900acd0d)
 + fetch: ignore SIGPIPE during network operation
 + fetch: avoid calling write_or_die()

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2019-03-07

 On platforms where "git fetch" is killed with SIGPIPE (e.g. OSX),
 the upload-pack that runs on the other end that hangs up after
 detecting an error could cause "git fetch" to die with a signal,
 which led to a flakey test.  "git fetch" now ignores SIGPIPE during
 the network portion of its operation (this is not a problem as we
 check the return status from our write(2)s).


* jk/virtual-objects-do-exist (2019-03-05) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-03-11 at 748c79a1f0)
 + rev-list: allow cached objects in existence check

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2019-03-07

 A recent update broke "is this object available to us?" check for
 well-known objects like an empty tree (which should yield "yes",
 even when there is no on-disk object for an empty tree), which has
 been corrected.


* js/rebase-orig-head-fix (2019-03-04) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-03-11 at 4b1b19d391)
 + built-in rebase: set ORIG_HEAD just once, before the rebase
 + built-in rebase: demonstrate that ORIG_HEAD is not set correctly
 + built-in rebase: use the correct reflog when switching branches
 + built-in rebase: no need to check out `onto` twice

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2019-03-07

 "git rebase" that was reimplemented in C did not set ORIG_HEAD
 correctly, which has been corrected.


* js/stress-test-ui-tweak (2019-03-04) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-03-11 at 223afded1c)
 + tests: introduce --stress-jobs=<N>
 + tests: let --stress-limit=<N> imply --stress

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2019-03-07

 Dev support.


* ma/clear-repository-format (2019-03-01) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-03-11 at f3db1c278f)
 + setup: fix memory leaks with `struct repository_format`
 + setup: free old value before setting `work_tree`

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2019-03-07

 The setup code has been cleaned up to avoid leaks around the
 repository_format structure.

 . evolve: add the git change list command
 . evolve: implement the git change command
 . evolve: add support for writing metacommits
 . evolve: add the change-table structure

* ms/worktree-add-atomic-mkdir (2019-03-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-03-20 at ded442ed02)
 + worktree: fix worktree add race

 "git worktree add" used to do a "find an available name with stat
 and then mkdir", which is race-prone.  This has been fixed by using
 mkdir and reacting to EEXIST in a loop.

 Will merge to 'master'.

  (merged to 'next' on 2019-03-20 at 5ccac5f80d)

* cc/replace-graft-peel-tags (2019-04-01) 4 commits
 - replace: fix --graft when passing a tag first
 - replace: fix --graft when passing a tag as parent
 - t6050: redirect expected error output to a file
 - t6050: use test_line_count instead of wc -l

 When given a tag that points at a commit-ish, "git replace --graft"
 failed to peel the tag before writing a replace ref, which did not
 make sense because the old graft mechanism the feature wants to
 mimick only allowed to replace one commit object with another.
 This has been fixed.

 The title of the top two commits are fairly useless and does not
 say how the issue was fixed, but the fix is to peel the given tag
 ourselves down to the underlying commit object.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* dk/blame-keep-origin-blob (2019-04-03) 1 commit
 - blame.c: don't drop origin blobs as eagerly

 Performance fix around "git blame", especially in a linear history
 (which is the norm we should optimize for).

 Will merge to 'next'.


* dl/forbid-tagging-a-tag (2019-04-03) 3 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - tag: prevent nested tags
 - tag: fix formatting

 "git tag $newtag $obj", when $obj is another tag, now aborts,
 requiring a new --allow-nested-tag option, even though an
 invocation with $obj that is a blob or a tree is silently allowed,
 which does not make much sense.
 
 Will discard.


* dl/rebase-i-keep-base (2019-04-03) 4 commits
 - rebase: teach rebase --keep-base
 - rebase: fast-forward --onto in more cases
 - t3432: test rebase fast-forward behavior
 - t3431: add rebase --fork-point tests

 "git rebase --keep-base <upstream>" tries to find the original base
 of the topic being rebased and rebase on top of that same base, which
 is useful when running the "git rebase -i" (and its limited variant
 "git rebase -x").

 Will merge to 'next'.


* en/fast-import-parsing-fix (2019-04-01) 5 commits
 - fast-import: fix erroneous handling of get-mark with empty orphan commits

* jh/midx-verify-too-many-packs (2019-03-22) 4 commits
 - midx: during verify group objects by packfile to speed verification
 - midx: add progress indicators in multi-pack-index verify
 - trace2:data: add trace2 data to midx
 - progress: add sparse mode to force 100% complete message

 "git multi-pack-index verify" did not scale well with the number of
 packfiles, which is being improved.

* jh/trace2-sid-fix (2019-04-01) 7 commits
 - trace2: make SIDs more unique

 - trace2: report peak memory usage of the process
 - trace2: use system config for default trace2 settings
 - trace2: find exec-dir before trace2 initialization
 - trace2: add absolute elapsed time to start event

 Polishing of the new trace2 facility continues.  The system-level
 configuration can specify site-wide trace2 settings (which would be
 loved by big-brother types ;-).

 Getting closer but still being discussed.

* js/spell-out-options-in-tests (2019-04-02) 8 commits
 - tests: disallow the use of abbreviated options (by default)

 - tests (status): spell out the `--find-renames` option in full
 - tests (push): do not abbreviate the `--follow-tags` option
 - t5531: avoid using an abbreviated option
 - t7810: do not abbreviate `--no-exclude-standard` nor `--invert-match`
 - tests (rebase): spell out the `--force-rebase` option
 - tests (rebase): spell out the `--keep-empty` option

 The tests have been updated not to rely on the abbreviated option
 names the parse-options API offers, to protect us from an
 abbreviated form of an option that used to be unique within the
 command getting non-unique when a new option that share the same
 prefix is added.

 - dir: do not traverse repositories with no commits
 - t3009: test that ls-files -o traverses bogus repo
 - t3000: move non-submodule repo test to separate file
 - submodule: refuse to add repository with no commits

 Running "git add" on a repository created inside the current
 repository is an explicit indication that the user wants to add it
 as a submodule, but when the HEAD of the inner repository is on an
 unborn branch, it cannot be added as a submodule.  Worse, the files
 in its working tree can be added as if they are a part of the outer
 repository, which is not what the user wants.  These problems are
 being addressed.

 "git checkout -m <other>" was about carrying the differences

  (merged to 'next' on 2019-03-20 at 92a24b29ed)
 + convert: avoid malloc of original file size

 When the "clean" filter can reduce the size of a huge file in the
 working tree down to a small "token" (a la Git LFS), there is no
 point in allocating a huge scratch area upfront, but the buffer is
 sized based on the original file size.  The convert mechanism now
 allocates very minimum and reallocates as it receives the output
 from the clean filter process.

 - sequencer.c: remove duplicate code

 - t7502: clean up style
 - t7604: clean up style
 - t3507: clean up style
 - t7600: clean up style

 The list of conflicted paths shown in the editor while concluding a
 conflicted merge was shown above the scissors line when the
 clean-up mode is set to "scissors", even though it was commented
 out just like the list of updated paths and other information to
 help the user explain the merge better.

 Needs review.

* jn/unknown-index-extensions (2018-11-21) 2 commits
 - index: offer advice for unknown index extensions
 - index: do not warn about unrecognized extensions

 A bit too alarming warning given when unknown index extensions
 exist is getting revamped.

 Expecting a reroll.

 (this branch is used by pw/rebase-i-internal-rfc.)

 The scripted version of "git rebase -i" wrote and rewrote the todo
 list many times during a single step of its operation, and the
 recent C-rewrite made a faithful conversion of the logic to C.  The
 implementation has been updated to carry necessary information
 around in-core to avoid rewriting the same file over and over
 unnecessarily.

 Will merge to 'next'.
