What's cooking in git.git (Jul 2018, #03; Wed, 25)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

Many topics have moved to 'master' and 'next' from 'next' to 'pu'
respectively.  As I needed to re-resolve semantic merge conflicts
while reordering some topics (i.e. some that were merged earlier in
'pu' are left in 'pu' while another topic that had interactions with
them and required evil merge to resolve semantic conflicts
leapfrogged to 'next'---the semantic conflict resolution then need
to happen at a different merge than done earlier in 'pu' while
rebuilding today's integration), I didn't have enough time to spend
on new topics posted to the list in the past few days.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

[Graduated to "master"]

* ag/rebase-p (2018-07-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-18 at c36ebba99b)
 + git-rebase--preserve-merges: fix formatting of todo help message

 The help message shown in the editor to edit todo list in "rebase -p"
 has regressed recently, which has been corrected.


* as/sequencer-customizable-comment-char (2018-07-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-18 at 4163e23f29)
 + sequencer: use configured comment character

 Honor core.commentchar when preparing the list of commits to replay
 in "rebase -i".


* bb/pedantic (2018-07-09) 8 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-18 at e9d075e8ed)
 + utf8.c: avoid char overflow
 + string-list.c: avoid conversion from void * to function pointer
 + sequencer.c: avoid empty statements at top level
 + convert.c: replace "\e" escapes with "\033".
 + fixup! refs/refs-internal.h: avoid forward declaration of an enum
 + refs/refs-internal.h: avoid forward declaration of an enum
 + fixup! connect.h: avoid forward declaration of an enum
 + connect.h: avoid forward declaration of an enum
 (this branch is used by bb/make-developer-pedantic.)

 The codebase has been updated to compile cleanly with -pedantic
 option.


* bb/unicode-11-width (2018-07-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-18 at 075648ed37)
 + unicode: update the width tables to Unicode 11

 The character display width table has been updated to match the
 latest Unicode standard.


* bc/send-email-auto-cte (2018-07-09) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-18 at d16c2a301a)
 + docs: correct RFC specifying email line length
 + send-email: automatically determine transfer-encoding
 + send-email: accept long lines with suitable transfer encoding
 + send-email: add an auto option for transfer encoding

 The content-transfer-encoding of the message "git send-email" sends
 out by default was 8bit, which can cause trouble when there is an
 overlong line to bust RFC 5322/2822 limit.  A new option 'auto' to
 automatically switch to quoted-printable when there is such a line
 in the payload has been introduced and is made the default.


* bp/log-ref-write-fd-with-strbuf (2018-07-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-18 at 25a3a99528)
 + convert log_ref_write_fd() to use strbuf

 Code clean-up.


* bw/ref-in-want (2018-06-28) 8 commits

 (this branch is used by bw/fetch-pack-i18n, jt/connectivity-check-after-unshallow, jt/partial-clone-fsck-connectivity and jt/tags-to-promised-blobs-fix.)

 Protocol v2 has been updated to allow slightly out-of-sync set of
 servers to work together to serve a single client, which would be
 useful with load-balanced servers that talk smart HTTP transport.


* en/apply-comment-fix (2018-06-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-18 at 31d818f17d)
 + apply: fix grammar error in comment

  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-18 at d597206c79)
 + git-rebase: make --allow-empty-message the default
 + t3401: add directory rename testcases for rebase and am
 + git-rebase.txt: document behavioral differences between modes
 + directory-rename-detection.txt: technical docs on abilities and limitations
 + git-rebase.txt: address confusion between --no-ff vs --force-rebase
 + git-rebase: error out when incompatible options passed
 + t3422: new testcases for checking when incompatible options passed
 + git-rebase.sh: update help messages a bit
 + git-rebase.txt: document incompatible options

 "git rebase" behaved slightly differently depending on which one of
 the three backends gets used; this has been documented and an
 effort to make them more uniform has begun.


* en/t5407-rebase-m-fix (2018-06-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-18 at 459875daeb)
 + t5407: fix test to cover intended arguments


* es/test-lint-one-shot-export (2018-07-16) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-18 at 26a6124963)
 + t/check-non-portable-shell: detect "FOO=bar shell_func"
 + t/check-non-portable-shell: make error messages more compact
 + t/check-non-portable-shell: stop being so polite
 + t6046/t9833: fix use of "VAR=VAL cmd" with a shell function
 + Merge branch 'jc/t3404-one-shot-export-fix' into es/test-lint-one-shot-export
 (this branch uses jc/t3404-one-shot-export-fix.)

 Look for broken use of "VAR=VAL shell_func" in test scripts as part
 of test-lint.


* hs/push-cert-check-cleanup (2018-07-11) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-18 at 1ed25fbd77)
 + gpg-interface: make parse_gpg_output static and remove from interface header
 + builtin/receive-pack: use check_signature from gpg-interface
 (this branch is used by hs/gpgsm.)

 Code clean-up.


* jc/t3404-one-shot-export-fix (2018-07-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-18 at e15a79dca7)
 + t3404: fix use of "VAR=VAL cmd" with a shell function
 (this branch is used by es/test-lint-one-shot-export.)

 Correct a broken use of "VAR=VAL shell_func" in a test.


* jk/empty-pick-fix (2018-07-11) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-18 at 43bfa862f2)
 + sequencer: don't say BUG on bogus input
 + sequencer: handle empty-set cases consistently

 Handling of an empty range by "git cherry-pick" was inconsistent
 depending on how the range ended up to be empty, which has been
 corrected.


* jk/fetch-all-peeled-fix (2018-07-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-18 at d06c6f1665)
 + t5500: prettify non-commit tag tests

 Test modernization.


* jk/for-each-ref-icase (2018-07-03) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-18 at 4c86d62adb)
 + ref-filter: avoid backend filtering with --ignore-case
 + for-each-ref: consistently pass WM_IGNORECASE flag
 + t6300: add a test for --ignore-case

 The "--ignore-case" option of "git for-each-ref" (and its friends)
 did not work correctly, which has been fixed.


* jt/connectivity-check-after-unshallow (2018-07-03) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-18 at 8e7ee889c3)
 + fetch-pack: write shallow, then check connectivity
 (this branch is used by jt/partial-clone-fsck-connectivity and jt/tags-to-promised-blobs-fix; uses bw/ref-in-want; is tangled with bw/fetch-pack-i18n.)

 "git fetch" failed to correctly validate the set of objects it
 received when making a shallow history deeper, which has been
 corrected.


* jt/partial-clone-fsck-connectivity (2018-07-09) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-18 at 968fd9c9f0)
 + clone: check connectivity even if clone is partial
 + upload-pack: send refs' objects despite "filter"
 (this branch is used by jt/tags-to-promised-blobs-fix; uses bw/ref-in-want and jt/connectivity-check-after-unshallow; is tangled with bw/fetch-pack-i18n.)

 Partial clone support of "git clone" has been updated to correctly
 validate the objects it receives from the other side.  The server
 side has been corrected to send objects that are directly
 requested, even if they may match the filtering criteria (e.g. when
 doing a "lazy blob" partial clone).


* kn/userdiff-php (2018-07-06) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-18 at 9a533dc33a)
 + userdiff: support new keywords in PHP hunk header
 + t4018: add missing test cases for PHP

 The userdiff pattern for .php has been updated.


* mh/fast-import-no-diff-delta-empty (2018-07-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-18 at eb393871f4)
 + fast-import: do not call diff_delta() with empty buffer

 "git fast-import" has been updated to avoid attempting to create
 delta against a zero-byte-long string, which is pointless.


* mk/merge-in-sparse-checkout (2018-07-11) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-18 at d2a6d2684d)
 + unpack-trees: do not fail reset because of unmerged skipped entry

 "git reset --merge" (hence "git merge ---abort") and "git reset --hard"
 had trouble working correctly in a sparsely checked out working
 tree after a conflict, which has been corrected.


* nd/command-list (2018-07-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-18 at 77ed2a3914)
 + vcbuild/README: update to accommodate for missing common-cmds.h

 Build doc update for Windows.


* rj/submodule-fsck-skip (2018-07-03) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-11 at 985f88cf7e)
 + fsck: check skiplist for object in fsck_blob()

 "fsck.skipList" did not prevent a blob object listed there from
 being inspected for is contents (e.g. we recently started to
 inspect the contents of ".gitmodules" for certain malicious
 patterns), which has been corrected.


* sb/blame-color (2018-07-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-18 at c319268502)
 + blame: prefer xsnprintf to strcpy for colors
 (this branch is used by jk/banned-function.)

 Code clean-up.


* sb/submodule-move-head-error-msg (2018-06-25) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-18 at 9e213ad1aa)
 + submodule.c: report the submodule that an error occurs in

 "git checkout --recurse-submodules another-branch" did not report
 in which submodule it failed to update the working tree, which
 resulted in an unhelpful error message.


* tb/config-default (2018-07-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-18 at 7994476f6f)
 + builtin/config: work around an unsized array forward declaration

 Compilation fix.


* wc/find-commit-with-pattern-on-detached-head (2018-07-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-18 at 334d2420c0)
 + sha1-name.c: for ":/", find detached HEAD commits

 "git rev-parse ':/substring'" did not consider the history leading
 only to HEAD when looking for a commit with the given substring,
 when the HEAD is detached.  This has been fixed.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* ds/commit-graph-with-grafts (2018-07-19) 8 commits
 - commit-graph: close_commit_graph before shallow walk
 - commit-graph: not compatible with uninitialized repo
 - commit-graph: not compatible with grafts
 - commit-graph: not compatible with replace objects
 - test-repository: properly init repo
 - commit-graph: update design document
 - refs.c: upgrade for_each_replace_ref to be a each_repo_ref_fn callback
 - refs.c: migrate internal ref iteration to pass thru repository argument
 (this branch uses ds/commit-graph-fsck, jt/commit-graph-per-object-store and sb/object-store-lookup; is tangled with ds/reachable.)

 The recently introduced commit-graph auxiliary data is incompatible
 with mechanisms such as replace & grafts that "breaks" immutable
 nature of the object reference relationship.  Disable optimizations
 based on its use (and updating existing commit-graph) when these
 incompatible features are in use in the repository.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/core-use-replace-refs (2018-07-18) 3 commits
 - add core.usereplacerefs config option
 - check_replace_refs: rename to read_replace_refs
 - check_replace_refs: fix outdated comment

 A new configuration variable core.usereplacerefs has been added,
 primarily to help server installations that want to ignore the
 replace mechanism altogether.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 - xdiff/xhistogram: factor out memory cleanup into free_index()
 - xdiff/xhistogram: pass arguments directly to fall_back_to_classic_diff

 "git diff --histogram" had a bad memory usage pattern, which has
 been rearranged to reduce the peak usage.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* bb/make-developer-pedantic (2018-07-25) 1 commit
 - Makefile: add a DEVOPTS flag to get pedantic compilation

 "make DEVELOPER=1 DEVOPTS=pedantic" allows developers to compile
 with -pedantic option, which may catch more problematic program
 constructs and potential bugs.

 Will merge to 'next' and then to 'master'.


* bw/clone-ref-prefixes (2018-07-20) 1 commit
 - clone: send ref-prefixes when using protocol v2

 The wire-protocol v2 relies on the client to send "ref prefixes" to
 limit the bandwidth spent on the initial ref advertisement.  "git
 clone" when learned to speak v2 forgot to do so, which has been
 corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 (this branch uses ds/commit-graph-fsck, jt/commit-graph-per-object-store and sb/object-store-lookup; is tangled with ds/commit-graph-with-grafts.)

 The code for computing history reachability has been shuffled,
 obtained a bunch of new tests to cover them, and then being
 improved.

* en/merge-recursive-skip-fix (2018-07-23) 2 commits
 - merge-recursive: preserve skip_worktree bit when necessary
 - t3507: add a testcase showing failure with sparse checkout

 When the sparse checkout feature is in use, "git cherry-pick" and
 other mergy operations lost the skip_worktree bit when a path that
 is excluded from checkout requires content level merge, which is
 resolved as the same as the HEAD version, without materializing the
 merge result in the working tree, which made the path appear as
 deleted.  This has been corrected by preserving the skip_worktree
 bit (and not materializing the file in the working tree).

 - banned.h: mark sprintf() as banned
 - banned.h: mark strcat() as banned
 - automatically ban strcpy()
 - Merge branch 'sb/blame-color' into jk/banned-function

 It is too easy to misuse system API functions such as strcat();

 - fetch: send "refs/tags/" prefix upon CLI refspecs
 - t5702: test fetch with multiple refspecs at a time

 The wire-protocol v2 relies on the client to send "ref prefixes" to
 limit the bandwidth spent on the initial ref advertisement.  "git
 fetch $remote branch:branch" that asks tags that point into the
 history leading to the "branch" automatically followed sent to
 narrow prefix and broke the tag following, which has been fixed.

 "git add -p" interactive interface learned to let users choose
 individual added/removed lines to be used in the operation, instead
 of accepting or rejecting a whole hunk.

 Expecting a reroll to reignite the discussion.

 We do not add random code that does not have real users to our

 - http-backend: respect CONTENT_LENGTH for receive-pack
 - http-backend: respect CONTENT_LENGTH as specified by rfc3875
 - http-backend: cleanup writing to child process

 whole input until EOF, without paying attention to CONTENT_LENGTH
 that is supplied in the environment and instead expecting the Web
 server to close the input stream.  This has been fixed.

 . zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

 Needs resurrecting by making sure the fix is good and still applies
 (or adjusted to today's codebase).

* am/sequencer-author-script-fix (2018-07-18) 1 commit
 - sequencer.c: terminate the last line of author-script properly

 The author-script that records the author information created by
 the sequencer machinery lacked the closing single quote on the last
 entry.

 Fixing this alone may or may not break the reader that may have
 been compensating for this bogus writer.  I think I saw another fix
 to the same source file posted today---if we are fixing, we should
 fix them all at the same time to keep the reader and the writer in
 sync.


* bc/sequencer-export-work-tree-as-well (2018-07-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-24 at 0b83ade721)
 + sequencer: pass absolute GIT_WORK_TREE to exec commands

 "git rebase" started exporting GIT_DIR environment variable and
 exposing it to hook scripts when part of it got rewritten in C.
 Instead of matching the old scripted Porcelains' behaviour,
 compensate by also exporting GIT_WORK_TREE environment as well to
 lessen the damage.  This can harm existing hooks that want to
 operate on different repository, but the current behaviour is
 already broken for them anyway.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 - read-cache: fix directory/file conflict handling in read_index_unmerged()
 - t1015: demonstrate directory/file conflict recovery failures

 "git merge --abort" etc. did not clean things up properly when
 there were conflicted entries in certain order that are involved
 in D/F conflicts.  This has been corrected.

 This may have to be rebased on an older maintenance track before
 moving forward.

 - gpg-interface t: extend the existing GPG tests with GPGSM

 - gpg-interface: introduce an abstraction for multiple gpg formats
 - t/t7510: check the validation of the new config gpg.format
 - gpg-interface: add new config to select how to sign a commit

 Teach "git tag -s" etc. a few configuration varaibles (gpg.format
 that can be set to "openpgp" or "x509", and gpg.<format>.program
 that is used to specify what program to use to deal with the format)
 to allow x.509 certs with CMS via "gpgsm" to be used instead of
 openpgp via "gnupg".

  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-24 at 2ea14c0afb)
 + has_uncommitted_changes(): fall back to empty tree

 "git pull --rebase" on a corrupt HEAD caused a segfault.  In
 general we substitute an empty tree object when running the in-core
 equivalent of the diff-index command, and the codepath has been
 corrected to do so as well to fix this issue.

 + send-email: fix tls AUTH when sending batch

 "git send-email" when using in a batched mode that limits the
 number of messages sent in a single SMTP session lost the contents
 of the variable used to choose between tls/ssl, unable to send the
 second and later batches, which has been fixed.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 This is marked to be merged to 'next' already, but I do not mind
 getting an updated version with an improved log message before that
 happens.


* jn/gc-auto (2018-07-17) 3 commits
 - gc: do not return error for prior errors in daemonized mode
 - gc: exit with status 128 on failure
 - gc: improve handling of errors reading gc.log

 "gc --auto" ended up calling exit(-1) upon error, which has been
 corrected to use exit(1).  Also the error reporting behaviour when
 daemonized has been updated to exit with zero status when stopping
 due to a previously discovered error (which implies there is no
 point running gc to improve the situation); we used to exit with
 failure in such a case.

 Stuck in review?

 + negotiator/skipping: skip commits during fetch
 (this branch uses jt/fetch-pack-negotiator; is tangled with jt/fetch-nego-tip.)

 Add a server-side knob to skip commits in exponential/fibbonacci
 stride in an attempt to cover wider swath of history with a smaller
 number of iterations, potentially accepting a larger packfile
 transfer, instead of going back one commit a time during common
 ancestor discovery during the "git fetch" transaction.

 "git tbdiff" that lets us compare individual patches in two
 iterations of a topic has been rewritten and made into a built-in
 command.

 Undecided.  

 Many "The feature is useful" comments without much real review; we
 know the feature is great as this mimicks tbdiff already so that is
 not news.

 I've squashed an obvious documentation fix in before rebasing the
 other topic that depends on it.  I _think_ we would probably be
 better off to _disable_ whitespace-error coloring altogether when
 showing diff-of-diff, and get rid of the workaround that only is
 applicable to the context lines of the outer diff (unless we first
 define how whitespace errors in diff-of-diff should be colored and
 implement it correctly, that is, but after seeing these two
 attempts, it seems that is harder than it is worth).

 "--date=auto" can be used to use this new format when the output is
 goint to the pager or to the terminal and otherwise the default
 format.


* ot/ref-filter-object-info (2018-07-17) 5 commits
 - ref-filter: use oid_object_info() to get object
 - ref-filter: merge get_obj and get_object
 - ref-filter: initialize eaten variable
 - ref-filter: fill empty fields with empty values
 - ref-filter: add info_source to valid_atom

 A few atoms like %(objecttype) and %(objectsize) in the format
 specifier of "for-each-ref --format=<format>" can be filled without
 getting the full contents of the object, but just with the object
 header.  These cases have been optimzied by calling
 oid_object_info() API.

 What's the doneness of this one?


* pk/rebase-in-c (2018-07-23) 4 commits
 - builtin/rebase: support running "git rebase <upstream>"
 - sequencer: refactor the code to detach HEAD to checkout.c
 - rebase: refactor common shell functions into their own file
 - rebase: start implementing it as a builtin

 Piecemeal rewrite of the "rebase" machinery in C.
 Expecting a reroll, but it seems that this is getting quite close.

* jt/fetch-nego-tip (2018-07-03) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-24 at a9e299006d)
 + fetch-pack: support negotiation tip whitelist
 (this branch uses jt/fetch-pack-negotiator; is tangled with jt/fetch-negotiator-skipping.)

 "git fetch" learned a new option "--negotiation-tip" to limit the
 set of commits it tells the other end as "have", to reduce wasted
 bandwidth and cycles, which would be helpful when the receiving
 repository has a lot of refs that have little to do with the
 history at the remote it is fetching from.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* tb/grep-only-matching (2018-07-09) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-24 at 7e878b9d95)
 + grep.c: teach 'git grep --only-matching'
 + grep.c: extract show_line_header()

 "git grep" learned the "--only-matching" option.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/branch-l-1-repurpose (2018-06-22) 1 commit
 - branch: make "-l" a synonym for "--list"

 Updated plan to repurpose the "-l" option to "git branch".

 Will hold in 'pu' until jk/branch-l-0-deprecation progresses sufficiently.


* cc/remote-odb (2018-07-16) 9 commits
 - Documentation/config: add odb.<name>.promisorRemote

* ds/multi-pack-index (2018-07-20) 23 commits
 - midx: clear midx on repack
 - packfile: skip loading index if in multi-pack-index
 - midx: prevent duplicate packfile loads
 - midx: use midx in approximate_object_count
 - midx: use existing midx when writing new one
 - midx: use midx in abbreviation calculations
 - midx: read objects from multi-pack-index
 - config: create core.multiPackIndex setting

 - midx: write header information to lockfile
 - multi-pack-index: add 'write' verb
 - multi-pack-index: add builtin
 - multi-pack-index: add format details
 - multi-pack-index: add design document

 When there are too many packfiles in a repository (which is not
 recommended), looking up an object in these would require
 consulting many pack .idx files; a new mechanism to have a single
 file that consolidates all of these .idx files is introduced.

* jt/fetch-pack-negotiator (2018-06-15) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-24 at 438efcd6b1)
 + fetch-pack: introduce negotiator API
 + fetch-pack: move common check and marking together
 + fetch-pack: make negotiation-related vars local
 + fetch-pack: use ref adv. to prune "have" sent

 (this branch is used by jt/fetch-nego-tip and jt/fetch-negotiator-skipping.)

 Code restructuring and a small fix to transport protocol v2 during
 fetching.

 Will merge to 'master'.

  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-24 at a06b453f32)
 + log: prevent error if line range ends past end of file
 + blame: prevent error if range ends past end of file

 Parsing of -L[<N>][,[<M>]] parameters "git blame" and "git log"
 take has been tweaked.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ab/checkout-default-remote (2018-06-11) 8 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-24 at 6ef645f485)
 + checkout & worktree: introduce checkout.defaultRemote
 + checkout: add advice for ambiguous "checkout <branch>"
 + builtin/checkout.c: use "ret" variable for return

 "git checkout" and "git worktree add" learned to honor
 checkout.defaultRemote when auto-vivifying a local branch out of a
 remote tracking branch in a repository with multiple remotes that
 have tracking branches that share the same names.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 a sane state.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ma/wrapped-info (2018-05-28) 2 commits
 - usage: prefix all lines in `vreportf()`, not just the first
 - usage: extract `prefix_suffix_lines()` from `advise()`

 An attempt to help making multi-line messages fed to warning(),
 error(), and friends more easily translatable.

 Will discard and wait for a cleaned-up rewrite.
 cf. <20180529213957.GF7964@sigill.intra.peff.net>


* jm/cache-entry-from-mem-pool (2018-07-03) 8 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-24 at 9be51a88dc)
 + block alloc: add validations around cache_entry lifecyle
 + block alloc: allocate cache entries from mem_pool
 + mem-pool: fill out functionality
 + mem-pool: add life cycle management functions
 + mem-pool: only search head block for available space
 + block alloc: add lifecycle APIs for cache_entry structs
 + read-cache: teach make_cache_entry to take object_id
 + read-cache: teach refresh_cache_entry to take istate

 For a large tree, the index needs to hold many cache entries
 allocated on heap.  These cache entries are now allocated out of a
 dedicated memory pool to amortize malloc(3) overhead.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 This makes each cache-entry larger by either 4 or 8 bytes, which is
 a bit sad, though.
