What's cooking in git.git (Oct 2023, #05; Thu, 12)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and
aren't considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL
to a message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity (of course they can be resubmit when new interests
arise).

There are too many topics marked with "Needs review" label.  I can
help reviewing some of them myself, but obviously it will not scale.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

* bc/racy-4gb-files (2023-10-12) 2 commits
 - Prevent git from rehashing 4GiB files
 - t: add a test helper to truncate files

 The index file has room only for lower 32-bit of the file size in
 the cached stat information, which means cached stat information
 will have 0 in its sd_size member for a file whose size is multiple
 of 4GiB.  This is mistaken for a racily clean path.  Avoid it by
 storing a bogus sd_size value instead for such files.

 Waiting for review response.

 "cd sub && git grep -f patterns" tried to read "patterns" file at
 the top level of the working tree; it has been corrected to read
 "sub/patterns" instead.

* pw/rebase-sigint (2023-09-07) 1 commit
 - rebase -i: ignore signals when forking subprocesses

 If the commit log editor or other external programs (spawned via
 "exec" insn in the todo list) receive internactive signal during
 "git rebase -i", it caused not just the spawned program but the
 "Git" process that spawned them, which is often not what the end
 user intended.  "git" learned to ignore SIGINT and SIGQUIT while
 waiting for these subprocesses.

 Expecting a reroll.

 In .gitmodules files, submodules are keyed by their names, and the
 path to the submodule whose name is $name is specified by the
 submodule.$name.path variable.  There were a few codepaths that
 mixed the name and path up when consulting the submodule database,
 which have been corrected.  It took long for these bugs to be found
 as the name of a submodule initially is the same as its path, and
 the problem does not surface until it is moved to a different path,
 which apparently happens very rarely.
