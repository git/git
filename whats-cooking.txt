What's cooking in git.git (May 2018, #02; Thu, 17)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* hn/sort-ls-remote (2018-04-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-30 at 244ca5d30a)
 + ls-remote: create '--sort' option

 "git ls-remote" learned an option to allow sorting its output based
 on the refnames being shown.


* sb/object-store-replace (2018-04-12) 15 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-25 at 9a213fb505)
 + replace-object: allow lookup_replace_object to handle arbitrary repositories
 + replace-object: allow do_lookup_replace_object to handle arbitrary repositories
 + replace-object: allow prepare_replace_object to handle arbitrary repositories
 + refs: allow for_each_replace_ref to handle arbitrary repositories
 + refs: store the main ref store inside the repository struct
 + replace-object: add repository argument to lookup_replace_object
 + replace-object: add repository argument to do_lookup_replace_object
 + replace-object: add repository argument to prepare_replace_object
 + refs: add repository argument to for_each_replace_ref
 + refs: add repository argument to get_main_ref_store
 + replace-object: check_replace_refs is safe in multi repo environment
 + replace-object: eliminate replace objects prepared flag
 + object-store: move lookup_replace_object to replace-object.h
 + replace-object: move replace_map to object store
 + replace_object: use oidmap
 (this branch is used by sb/object-store-alloc and sb/oid-object-info.)

 The effort to pass the repository in-core structure throughout the
 API continues.  This round deals with the code that implements the
 refs/replace/ mechanism.


* ab/git-svn-get-record-typofix (2018-04-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-30 at 23f875f6b9)
 + git-svn: avoid warning on undef readline()

 "git svn" had a minor thinko/typo which has been fixed.


* ab/nuke-emacs-contrib (2018-04-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-25 at 9b133d8a65)
 + git{,-blame}.el: remove old bitrotting Emacs code

 The scripts in contrib/emacs/ have outlived their usefulness and
 have been replaced with a stub that errors out and tells the user
 there are replacements.


* ab/simplify-perl-makefile (2018-04-19) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-25 at 906cf21682)
 + Makefile: mark perllibdir as a .PHONY target
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-17 at 4448756934)
 + perl: fix installing modules from contrib

 Recent simplification of build procedure forgot a bit of tweak to
 the build procedure of contrib/mw-to-git/


* bt/gpg-interface (2018-04-16) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-30 at 50c507b7d8)
 + gpg-interface: find the last gpg signature line
 + gpg-interface: extract gpg line matching helper
 + gpg-interface: fix const-correctness of "eol" pointer
 + gpg-interface: use size_t for signature buffer size
 + gpg-interface: modernize function declarations
 + gpg-interface: handle bool user.signingkey
 + t7004: fix mistaken tag name

 What is queued here is only the obviously correct and
 uncontroversial code clean-up part, which is an earlier 7 patches,
 of a larger series.

 The remainder that is not queued introduces a few configuration
 variables to deal with e-signature backends with different
 signature format.


* bw/protocol-v2 (2018-03-15) 35 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-11 at 23ee234a2c)

 (this branch is used by bw/server-options and jt/partial-clone-proto-v2.)

 The beginning of the next-gen transfer protocol.


* dj/runtime-prefix (2018-04-24) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-25 at e7e635a70e)
 + Makefile: quote $INSTLIBDIR when passing it to sed

 + exec_cmd: provide a new-style RUNTIME_PREFIX helper for Windows
 + exec_cmd: RUNTIME_PREFIX on some POSIX systems
 + Makefile: add Perl runtime prefix support
 + Makefile: generate Perl header from template file
 (this branch is tangled with js/runtime-prefix.)

 A build-time option has been added to allow Git to be told to refer
 to its associated files relative to the main binary, in the same
 way that has been possible on Windows for quite some time, for
 Linux, BSDs and Darwin.


* ds/commit-graph (2018-04-11) 16 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-25 at 18af3d28d9)
 + commit-graph: implement "--append" option
 + commit-graph: build graph from starting commits
 + commit-graph: read only from specific pack-indexes

 + csum-file: refactor finalize_hashfile() method
 + csum-file: rename hashclose() to finalize_hashfile()
 + Merge branch 'jk/cached-commit-buffer' into HEAD
 + Merge branch 'jt/binsearch-with-fanout' into HEAD
 (this branch is used by ds/generation-numbers and ds/lazy-load-trees.)

 Precompute and store information necessary for ancestry traversal
 in a separate file to optimize graph walking.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/parseopt-expiry-errors (2018-04-23) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-30 at 637085f3d8)
 + parseopt: handle malformed --expire arguments more nicely
 + gc: do not upcase error message shown with die()

 "git gc --prune=nonsense" spent long time repacking and then
 silently failed when underlying "git prune --expire=nonsense"
 failed to parse its command line.  This has been corrected.


* js/colored-push-errors (2018-04-24) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-30 at 31076c52a2)
 + config: document the settings to colorize push errors/hints
 + push: test to verify that push errors are colored
 + push: colorize errors
 + color: introduce support for colorizing stderr

 Error messages from "git push" can be painted for more visibility.


* js/empty-config-section-fix (2018-04-09) 15 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-25 at 1690df3e5f)
 + git_config_set: reuse empty sections
 + git config --unset: remove empty sections (in the common case)
 + git_config_set: make use of the config parser's event stream
 + git_config_set: do not use a state machine
 + config_set_store: rename some fields for consistency
 + config: avoid using the global variable `store`
 + config: introduce an optional event stream while parsing
 + t1300: `--unset-all` can leave an empty section behind (bug)
 + t1300: add a few more hairy examples of sections becoming empty
 + t1300: remove unreasonable expectation from TODO
 + t1300: avoid relying on a bug
 + config --replace-all: avoid extra line breaks
 + t1300: demonstrate that --replace-all can "invent" newlines
 + t1300: rename it to reflect that `repo-config` was deprecated
 + git_config_set: fix off-by-two

 "git config --unset a.b", when "a.b" is the last variable in an
 otherwise empty section "a", left an empty section "a" behind, and
 worse yet, a subsequent "git config a.c value" did not reuse that
 empty shell and instead created a new one.  These have been
 (partially) corrected.


* js/ident-date-fix (2018-04-19) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-30 at d50ec2f4c1)
 + sequencer: reset the committer date before commits

 During a "rebase -i" session, the code could give older timestamp
 to commits created by later "pick" than an earlier "reword", which
 has been corrected.


* js/runtime-prefix (2018-04-24) 8 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-30 at c6cfccf40e)
 + Avoid multiple PREFIX definitions
 + git_setup_gettext: plug memory leak
 + gettext: avoid initialization if the locale dir is not present
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-17 at a69aaa7a22)
 + mingw/msvc: use the new-style RUNTIME_PREFIX helper
 + exec_cmd: provide a new-style RUNTIME_PREFIX helper for Windows
 + exec_cmd: RUNTIME_PREFIX on some POSIX systems
 + Makefile: add Perl runtime prefix support
 + Makefile: generate Perl header from template file
 (this branch is tangled with dj/runtime-prefix.)


* ls/checkout-encoding (2018-04-16) 10 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-25 at e0f8554b2a)
 + convert: add round trip check based on 'core.checkRoundtripEncoding'
 + convert: add tracing for 'working-tree-encoding' attribute
 + convert: check for detectable errors in UTF encodings
 + convert: add 'working-tree-encoding' attribute
 + utf8: add function to detect a missing UTF-16/32 BOM
 + utf8: add function to detect prohibited UTF-16/32 BOM
 + utf8: teach same_encoding() alternative UTF encoding names
 + strbuf: add a case insensitive starts_with()
 + strbuf: add xstrdup_toupper()
 + strbuf: remove unnecessary NUL assignment in xstrdup_tolower()

 The new "checkout-encoding" attribute can ask Git to convert the
 contents to the specified encoding when checking out to the working
 tree (and the other way around when checking in).


* ma/double-dashes-in-docs (2018-04-18) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-25 at aaac2dc63c)
 + git-submodule.txt: quote usage in monospace, drop backslash
 + git-[short]log.txt: unify quoted standalone --
 + doc: convert [\--] to [--]
 + doc: convert \--option to --option

 Doc formatting updates.


* ma/fast-export-skip-merge-fix (2018-04-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-30 at f7fca02ab1)
 + fast-export: fix regression skipping some merge-commits

 "git fast-export" had a regression in v2.15.0 era where it skipped
 some merge commits in certain cases, which has been corrected.


* ma/http-walker-no-partial (2018-04-24) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-30 at 4582c99ba8)
 + walker: drop fields of `struct walker` which are always 1
 + http-fetch: make `-a` standard behavior

 "git http-fetch" (deprecated) had an optional and experimental
 "feature" to fetch only commits and/or trees, which nobody used.
 This has been removed.


* nd/submodule-status-fix (2018-04-19) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-30 at 34d1f9ca83)
 + submodule--helper: don't print null in 'submodule status'

 "git submodule status" did not check the symbolic revision name it
 computed for the submodule HEAD is not the NULL, and threw it at
 printf routines, which has been corrected.


* nd/warn-more-for-devs (2018-04-16) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-25 at 2978e61414)
 + Makefile: add a DEVOPTS to get all of -Wextra
 + Makefile: add a DEVOPTS to suppress -Werror under DEVELOPER
 + Makefile: detect compiler and enable more warnings in DEVELOPER=1
 + connect.c: mark die_initial_contact() NORETURN

 The build procedure "make DEVELOPER=YesPlease" learned to enable a
 bit more warning options depending on the compiler used to help
 developers more.  There also is "make DEVOPTS=tokens" knob
 available now, for those who want to help fixing warnings we
 usually ignore, for example.


* ot/libify-get-ref-atom-value (2018-03-29) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-25 at 056bcaa69c)
 + ref-filter: libify get_ref_atom_value()
 + ref-filter: add return value to parsers
 + ref-filter: change parsing function error handling
 + ref-filter: add return value && strbuf to handlers
 + ref-filter: start adding strbufs with errors
 + ref-filter: add shortcut to work with strbufs

 Code restructuring, in preparation for further work.


* sa/send-email-dedup-some-headers (2018-04-19) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-30 at 2a1fd8217e)
 + send-email: avoid duplicate In-Reply-To/References

 When fed input that already has In-Reply-To: and/or References:
 headers and told to add the same information, "git send-email"
 added these headers separately, instead of appending to an existing
 one, which is a violation of the RFC.  This has been corrected.


* sb/submodule-move-nested (2018-03-29) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-25 at 86b177433a)
 + submodule: fixup nested submodules after moving the submodule
 + submodule-config: remove submodule_from_cache
 + submodule-config: add repository argument to submodule_from_{name, path}
 + submodule-config: allow submodule_free to handle arbitrary repositories
 + grep: remove "repo" arg from non-supporting funcs
 + submodule.h: drop declaration of connect_work_tree_and_git_dir

 Moving a submodule that itself has submodule in it with "git mv"
 forgot to make necessary adjustment to the nested sub-submodules;
 now the codepath learned to recurse into the submodules.


* sb/worktree-remove-opt-force (2018-04-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-25 at 0367d52a4b)
 + worktree: accept -f as short for --force for removal

 "git worktree remove" learned that "-f" is a shorthand for
 "--force" option, just like for "git worktree add".


* sg/completion-clear-cached (2018-04-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-25 at 9178da6c3d)
 + completion: reduce overhead of clearing cached --options

 The completion script (in contrib/) learned to clear cached list of
 command line options upon dot-sourcing it again in a more efficient
 way.


* sg/doc-gc-quote-mismatch-fix (2018-04-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-25 at bc3d1abf45)
 + docs/git-gc: fix minor rendering issue

 Doc formatting fix.


* so/glossary-ancestor (2018-04-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-25 at 0a849fee00)
 + glossary: substitute "ancestor" for "direct ancestor" in 'push' description.

 Docfix.


* tb/config-default (2018-04-23) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-25 at 59bb6beb2a)
 + builtin/config: introduce `color` type specifier
 + config.c: introduce 'git_config_color' to parse ANSI colors
 + builtin/config: introduce `--default`
 (this branch uses tb/config-type.)

 "git config --get" learned the "--default" option, to help the
 calling script.  Building on top of the tb/config-type topic, the
 "git config" learns "--type=color" type.  Taken together, you can
 do things like "git config --get foo.color --default blue" and get
 the ANSI color sequence for the color given to foo.color variable,
 or "blue" if the variable does not exist.


* tb/config-type (2018-04-19) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-25 at fe69e93c82)
 + builtin/config.c: support `--type=<type>` as preferred alias for `--<type>`
 + builtin/config.c: treat type specifiers singularly
 (this branch is used by tb/config-default.)

 The "git config" command uses separate options e.g. "--int",
 "--bool", etc. to specify what type the caller wants the value to
 be interpreted as.  A new "--type=<typename>" option has been
 introduced, which would make it cleaner to define new types.


* tg/demote-stash-save-in-completion (2018-04-20) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-30 at 93d0af5375)
 + completion: make stash -p and alias for stash push -p
 + completion: stop showing 'save' for stash by default

 The command line completion (in contrib/) has been taught that "git
 stash save" has been deprecated ("git stash push" is the preferred
 spelling in the new world) and does not offer it as a possible
 completion candidate when "git stash push" can be.


* tq/t1510 (2018-04-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-25 at 5710c81979)
 + t1510-repo-setup.sh: remove useless mkdir

 Test cleanup.


* tz/doc-git-urls-reference (2018-04-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-30 at 39926c99fd)
 + doc/clone: update caption for GIT URLS cross-reference

 Doc fix.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* hn/sort-ls-remote (2018-05-14) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-16 at 64336850f2)
 + t5512: run git fetch inside test

 Hotfix.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* sb/object-store-replace (2018-05-10) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-16 at 41bbedcc81)
 + replace-object.c: remove the_repository from prepare_replace_object
 + object.c: free replace map in raw_object_store_clear

 Hotfix.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* sg/t6500-no-redirect-of-stdin (2018-05-09) 1 commit

 - t/test-lib: introduce OID_REGEX
 - t: switch $_z40 to $ZERO_OID
 - t/test-lib: introduce ZERO_OID
 - t/test-lib: add an SHA1 prerequisite

 Many tests hardcode the raw object names, which would change once
 we migrate away from SHA-1.  While some of them must test against
 exact object names, most of them do not have to use hardcoded
 constants in the test.  The latter kind of tests have been updated
 to test the moral equivalent of the original without hardcoding the
 actual object names.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* bp/status-rename-config (2018-05-13) 1 commit
 - add status config and command line options for rename detection
 (this branch uses em/status-rename-config.)

 "git status" learned to honor a new status.renames configuration to
 skip rename detection, which could be useful for those who want to
 do so without disabling the default rename detection done by the
 "git diff" command.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 - refs: handle zero oid for pseudorefs
 - t1400: add tests around adding/deleting pseudorefs
 - refs.c: refer to "object ID", not "sha1", in error messages

 "git update-ref A B" is supposed to ensure that ref A does not yet
 exist when B is a NULL OID, but this check was not done correctly
 for pseudo-refs outside refs/ hierarchy, e.g. MERGE_HEAD.

* nd/commit-util-to-slab (2018-05-14) 14 commits
 - commit.h: delete 'util' field in struct commit
 - merge: use commit-slab in merge remote desc instead of commit->util
 - log: use commit-slab in prepare_bases() instead of commit->util
 - show-branch: use commit-slab for commit-name instead of commit->util
 - name-rev: use commit-slab for rev-name instead of commit->util
 - bisect.c: use commit-slab for commit weight instead of commit->util
 - revision.c: use commit-slab for show_source
 - sequencer.c: use commit-slab to associate todo items to commits
 - sequencer.c: use commit-slab to mark seen commits
 - shallow.c: use commit-slab for commit depth instead of commit->util
 - describe: use commit-slab for commit names instead of commit->util
 - blame: use commit-slab for blame suspects instead of commit->util
 - commit-slab: support shared commit-slab
 - commit-slab.h: code split

 The in-core "commit" object had an all-purpose "void *util" field,
 which was tricky to use especially in library-ish part of the
 code.  All of the existing uses of the field has been migrated to a
 more dedicated "commit-slab" mechanism and the field is eliminated.

* nd/diff-apply-ita (2018-05-14) 2 commits
 - apply: add --intent-to-add
 - diff: turn --ita-invisible-in-index on by default

 "git diff" compares the index and the working tree.  For paths
 added with intent-to-add bit, the command shows the full contents
 of them as added, but the paths themselves were not marked as new
 files.  They are now shown as new by default.

 "git apply" learned the "--intent-to-add" option so that an
 otherwise working-tree-only application of a patch will add new
 paths to the index marked with the "intent-to-add" bit.

 tried to list the existing tags on a display with non-default width.

 - merge-recursive: i18n submodule merge output and respect verbosity
 - submodule.c: move submodule merging to merge-recursive.c

 By code restructuring of submodule merge in merge-recursive,
 informational messages from the codepath are now given using the
 same mechanism as other output, and honor the merge.verbosity
 configuration.  The code also learned to give a few new messages
 when a submodule three-way merge resolves cleanly when one side
 records a descendant of the commit chosen by the other side.

* sb/submodule-update-try-harder (2018-05-16) 1 commit
 - git-submodule.sh: try harder to fetch a submodule

 "git submodule update" attempts two different kinds of "git fetch"
 against the upstream repository to grab a commit bound at the
 submodule's path, but it incorrectly gave up if the first kind
 (i.e. a normal fetch) failed, making the second "last resort" one
 (i.e. fetching an exact commit object by object name) ineffective.
 This has been corrected.

 - block alloc: add lifecycle APIs for cache_entry structs

 For a large tree, the index needs to hold many cache entries
 allocated on heap.  These cache entries are now allocated out of a
 dedicated memory pool to amortize malloc(3) overhead.

 Needs review.
 Is the "caller always knows which pool an entry came from and calls
 the right kind of free" a feasible approach?

 "git rebase -i" sometimes left intermediate "# This is a
 combination of N commits" message meant for the human consumption
 inside an editor in the final result in certain corner cases, which
 has been fixed.

 (this branch is used by ds/commit-graph-lockfile-fix; uses ds/lazy-load-trees.)

 A recently added "commit-graph" datafile has learned to store
 pre-computed generation numbers to speed up the decisions to stop
 history traversal.

 Is this ready for 'next' with ds/commit-graph-lockfile-fix?
 A commit with triple 'm' needs its title amended, though.

 + directory rename detection: directory splitting testcases
 + directory rename detection: basic testcases
 (this branch is used by bp/merge-rename-config.)

 Rename detection logic in "diff" family that is used in "merge" has
 learned to guess when all of x/a, x/b and x/c have moved to z/a,
 z/b and z/c, it is likely that x/d added in the meantime would also
 want to move to z/d by taking the hint that the entire directory
 'x' moved to 'z'.  A bug causing dirty files involved in a rename
 to be overwritten during merge has also been fixed as part of this
 work.  Incidentally, this also avoids updating a file in the
 working tree after a (non-trivial) merge whose result matches what
 our side originally had.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 - Remove common-cmds.h
 - help: use command-list.h for common command list
 - generate-cmds.sh: export all commands to command-list.h

 The list of commands with their various attributes were spread
 across a few places in the build procedure, but it now is getting a
 bit more consolidated to allow more automation.

* sb/blame-color (2018-04-24) 3 commits
 - builtin/blame: add new coloring scheme config
 - builtin/blame: highlight recently changed lines
 - builtin/blame: dim uninteresting metadata lines

 "git blame" learns to unhighlight uninteresting metadata from the
 originating commit on lines that are the same as the previous one,
 and also paint lines in different colors depending on the age of
 the commit.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ds/lazy-load-trees (2018-05-02) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-02 at d54016d9e3)
 + coccinelle: avoid wrong transformation suggestions from commit.cocci
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-25 at b90813f421)
 + commit-graph: lazy-load trees for commits
 + treewide: replace maybe_tree with accessor methods
 + commit: create get_commit_tree() method
 + treewide: rename tree to maybe_tree
 + Merge branch 'bw/c-plus-plus' into ds/lazy-load-trees
 (this branch is used by ds/commit-graph-lockfile-fix and ds/generation-numbers.)

 The code has been taught to use the duplicated information stored
 in the commit-graph file to learn the tree object name for a commit
 to avoid opening and parsing the commit object when it makes sense
 to do so.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/branch-l-0-deprecation (2018-03-26) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-11 at 9b2b0305dd)
 + branch: deprecate "-l" option
 + t: switch "branch -l" to "branch --create-reflog"
 + t3200: unset core.logallrefupdates when testing reflog creation
 (this branch is used by jk/branch-l-1-removal and jk/branch-l-2-reincarnation.)

 The "-l" option in "git branch -l" is an unfortunate short-hand for
 "--create-reflog", but many users, both old and new, somehow expect
 it to be something else, perhaps "--list".  This step deprecates
 the short-hand and warns about the future removal of the it when it
 is used.

 Will cook in 'next'.
 Perhaps merge to 'master' immediately after 2.18 release?


* jk/branch-l-1-removal (2018-03-26) 1 commit
 - branch: drop deprecated "-l" option
 (this branch is used by jk/branch-l-2-reincarnation; uses jk/branch-l-0-deprecation.)

 Following the "git branch -l" deprecation, the short-hand is removed.

 Will keep in 'pu'.


* jk/branch-l-2-reincarnation (2018-03-26) 1 commit
 - branch: make "-l" a synonym for "--list"
 (this branch uses jk/branch-l-0-deprecation and jk/branch-l-1-removal.)

 Following the "git branch -l" removal, "-l" is resurrected as a
 short-hand for "--list".

 Will keep in 'pu'.


* nd/pack-objects-pack-struct (2018-04-16) 15 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-16 at 171459475d)
 + ci: exercise the whole test suite with uncommon code in pack-objects
 + pack-objects: reorder members to shrink struct object_entry
 + pack-objects: shrink delta_size field in struct object_entry
 + pack-objects: shrink size field in struct object_entry
 + pack-objects: clarify the use of object_entry::size
 + pack-objects: don't check size when the object is bad
 + pack-objects: shrink z_delta_size field in struct object_entry
 + pack-objects: refer to delta objects by index instead of pointer
 + pack-objects: move in_pack out of struct object_entry
 + pack-objects: move in_pack_pos out of struct object_entry
 + pack-objects: use bitfield for object_entry::depth
 + pack-objects: use bitfield for object_entry::dfs_state
 + pack-objects: turn type and in_pack_type to bitfields
 + pack-objects: a bit of document about struct object_entry
 + read-cache.c: make $GIT_TEST_SPLIT_INDEX boolean

 "git pack-objects" needs to allocate tons of "struct object_entry"
 while doing its work, and shrinking its size helps the performance
 quite a bit.

* nd/repack-keep-pack (2018-04-16) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-08 at ab906be358)
 + pack-objects: show some progress when counting kept objects
 + gc --auto: exclude base pack if not enough mem to "repack -ad"
 + gc: handle a corner case in gc.bigPackThreshold
 + gc: add gc.bigPackThreshold config
 + gc: add --keep-largest-pack option
 + repack: add --keep-pack option
 + t7700: have closing quote of a test at the beginning of line

 "git gc" in a large repository takes a lot of time as it considers
 to repack all objects into one pack by default.  The command has
 been taught to pretend as if the largest existing packfile is
 marked with ".keep" so that it is left untouched while objects in
 other packs and loose ones are repacked.

 (this branch is used by js/sequencer-and-root-commits.)

 "git rebase" learned "--rebase-merges" to transplant the whole
 topology of commit graph elsewhere.

* js/runtime-prefix-windows (2018-03-27) 5 commits
 . mingw/msvc: use the new-style RUNTIME_PREFIX helper
 . exec_cmd: provide a new-style RUNTIME_PREFIX helper for Windows
 . exec_cmd: RUNTIME_PREFIX on some POSIX systems
 . Makefile: add Perl runtime prefix support
 . Makefile: generate Perl header from template file

 The Windows port was the first that allowed Git to be installed
 anywhere by having its components refer to each other with relative
 pathnames.  The recent dj/runtime-prefix topic extends the idea to
 other platforms, and its approach has been adopted back in the
 Windows port.

 Ejected, as the parent topic dj/runtime-prefix covers Windows now.


* bp/fsexcludes (2018-04-16) 2 commits
 . fsmonitor: switch to use new fsexcludes logic and remove unused untracked cache based logic
 . fsexcludes: add a programmatic way to exclude files from git's working directory traversal logic

 Can we have a few lines summary here, just like we have for other
 topic ;-) I personally take the overlong title of these commits as
 a sign that they can further be simplified and cleaned up by
 splitting, focusing the scope, etc.

 Retracted.
