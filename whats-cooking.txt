What's cooking in git.git (Feb 2010, #04; Wed, 17)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones
marked with '.' do not appear in any of the integration branches, but I am
still holding onto them.

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* jk/cherry-pick-reword (2010-02-11) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-02-11 at d0eace1)
 + cherry-pick: prettify the advice message
 + cherry-pick: show commit name instead of sha1
 + cherry-pick: format help message as strbuf
 + cherry-pick: refactor commit parsing code
 + cherry-pick: rewrap advice message

* rs/git-dir-cleanup (2010-02-11) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-02-11 at fa4f83c)
 + Untouch RelNotes 1.7.0: grep --no-index will not be in the release
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-02-06 at ef8ab9b)
 + Resurrect "git grep --no-index"
 + setenv(GIT_DIR) clean-up

* jk/grep-double-dash (2010-02-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-02-07 at 2ac040d)
 + accept "git grep -- pattern"

* jc/typo (2010-02-03) 1 commit
 + Typofixes outside documentation area

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* dp/maint-1.6.3-hash-sans-mmap (2010-02-14) 1 commit
 - don't use mmap() to hash files

This was more of an RFC in that slurping a potentially huge file into
memory without using mmap() was conceptually wrong. I suspect somebody
is cooking a patch to hash and compress a large blob in chunks straight
into a packfile as a replacement ;-).

* jc/for-each-ref (2010-02-13) 4 commits
 - for-each-ref --format='%(flag)'
 - for-each-ref --format='%(symref) %(symref:short)'
 - builtin-for-each-ref.c: check if we need to peel onion while parsing the format
 - builtin-for-each-ref.c: comment fixes

Should be Ok for 'next'.

* jn/gitweb-config-error-die (2010-02-14) 1 commit
 - gitweb: Die if there are parsing errors in config file

Should be Ok for 'next'.

* jn/maint-fix-pager (2010-02-14) 6 commits
 - tests: Add tests for automatic use of pager
 - am: Fix launching of pager
 - git svn: Fix launching of pager
 - git.1: Clarify the behavior of the --paginate option
 - Make 'git var GIT_PAGER' always print the configured pager
 - Fix 'git var' usage synopsis

Should be Ok for 'next'.

* ml/color-when (2010-02-16) 1 commit
 - Add an optional argument for --color options

* hm/imap-send-cram-md5 (2010-02-15) 1 commit
 - imap-send: support CRAM-MD5 authentication

A potential clean-up sent as a counter-proposal; waiting for response.

* jh/maint-submodule-status-in-void (2010-02-16) 1 commit
 - submodule summary: Don't barf when invoked in an empty repo

Looked Ok for 'next' but I lost track somewhat...

* ld/maint-diff-quiet-w (2010-02-16) 1 commit
 - git diff --quiet -w: check and report the status

Needs tests but otherwise looked Ok.

* ml/maint-grep-doc (2010-02-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-02-16 at 4059a38)
 + grep documentation: clarify what files match

Soon to graduate to 'master'.

* tc/maint-transport-ls-remote-with-void (2010-02-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-02-16 at e6ef1a8)
 + transport: add got_remote_refs flag

Soon to graduate to 'master'.

* bg/apply-blank-at-eof (2010-02-17) 3 commits
 - t3417: Add test cases for "rebase --whitespace=fix"
 - t4124: Add additional tests of --whitespace=fix
 - apply: Allow blank context lines to match beyond EOF

RFC.

* gf/maint-sh-setup-nongit-ok (2010-02-16) 1 commit
 - require_work_tree broken with NONGIT_OK

Looked sensible and ready for 'next'.

* ml/send-pack-transport-refactor (2010-02-16) 1 commit
 - Refactoring: remove duplicated code from builtin-send-pack.c and transport.c

Probably ready for 'next'.

* np/fast-import-idx-v2 (2010-02-17) 6 commits
 - fast-import: use the diff_delta() max_delta_size argument
 - fast-import: honor pack.indexversion and pack.packsizelimit config vars
 - fast-import: make default pack size unlimited
 - fast-import: use write_idx_file() instead of custom code
 - fast-import: use sha1write() for pack data
 - fast-import: start using struct pack_idx_entry

* sd/format-patch-to (2010-02-17) 1 commit
 - Add 'git format-patch --to=' option and 'format.to' configuration variable.

Shouldn't be too hard to add tests to t4014; other than that looked ready
for 'next'.

* sd/init-template (2010-02-17) 2 commits
 - Add a "TEMPLATE DIRECTORY" section to git-init[1].
 - Add `init.templatedir` configuration variable.

Shouldn't be too hard to add tests to t0001; other than that looked ready
for 'next'.

* sd/log-decorate (2010-02-17) 3 commits
 - log.decorate: usability fixes
 - Add `log.decorate' configuration variable.
 - git_config_maybe_bool()

Probably ready for 'next', except that people need to be warned about
having to update their scripts to explicitly pass --no-decorate to keep
them working.

* jc/maint-status-preload (2010-02-17) 1 commit
 - status: preload index to optimize lstat(2) calls

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* ld/push-porcelain (2010-02-09) 4 commits
 - git-push: fix an error message so it goes to stderr
 - git-push: make git push --dry-run --porcelain exit with status 0 even if updates will be rejected
 - git-push: send "To <remoteurl>" messages to the standard output in --porcelain mode
 - git-push: squelch advice message if in --porcelain mode

After some discussion this needs further simplification?  May need to move
to Stalled.

* cp/add-u-pathspec (2010-02-09) 2 commits
 - test for add with non-existent pathspec
 - git add -u: die on unmatched pathspec

I am a bit torn on this one.  Traditionally we never complained on
unmatched pathspec when talking about tracked files.  If we were to go
this route, I think we should probably enhance the "run_diff_files" and
friends in such a way that they mark matched pathspecs, in a way similar
to match_pathspec() in dir.c does, and report unmatched ones based on
that result, instead of adding an extra pass to scan the index.  The same
goes for pathspec_matches() in builtin-grep.c

Incidentally, I've proposed "pathspec unification" as possible GSoC'10
project---with luck, we might finally see a progress on this front ;-)

* hm/maint-imap-send-crlf (2010-02-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-02-17 at c6162cb)
 + git-imap-send: Convert LF to CRLF before storing patch to draft box

Soon to graduate to 'master'.

* nd/root-git (2010-02-14) 5 commits
 - Add test for using Git at root of file system
 - Support working directory located at root
 - Move offset_1st_component() to path.c
 - init-db, rev-parse --git-dir: do not append redundant slash
 - make_absolute_path(): Do not append redundant slash

How does this interact with the much larger series to rework the set-up
codepath?

* pb/log-first-parent-p-m (2010-02-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-02-17 at 2f8e5ae)
 + git log -p -m: document -m and honor --first-parent

Needs tests but otherwise looked fine.  We might want to teach "-m trumps
implicit --cc" to "git show", but that is a totally separate topic.

* sp/maint-push-sideband (2010-02-10) 8 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-02-16 at 6f19e5b)
 + receive-pack: Send internal errors over side-band #2
 + t5401: Use a bare repository for the remote peer
 + receive-pack: Send hook output over side band #2
 + receive-pack: Wrap status reports inside side-band-64k
 + receive-pack: Refactor how capabilities are shown to the client
 + send-pack: demultiplex a sideband stream with status data
 + run-command: support custom fd-set in async
 + run-command: Allow stderr to be a caller supplied pipe
 (this branch is used by sp/push-sideband.)

Based on 1.6.5 maintenance track.

* sp/push-sideband (2010-02-10) 0 commits
 (this branch uses sp/maint-push-sideband.)

This also is in 'next' now.

* ac/cvsimport-revision-mapping (2010-02-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-02-17 at 6756446)
 + cvsimport: new -R option: generate .git/cvs-revisions mapping

Any comments from CVSimport users?

* js/rebase-origin-x (2010-02-05) 1 commit
 - [RFC w/o test and incomplete] rebase: add -x option to record original commit name

I retract my objection against the idea of -x; needs polishing before
moving forward.

* jn/maint-makedepend (2010-01-26) 5 commits
 - Makefile: drop dependency on $(wildcard */*.h)
 - Makefile: clean up http-walker.o dependency rules
 - Makefile: remove wt-status.h from LIB_H
 - Makefile: make sure test helpers are rebuilt when headers change
 - Makefile: add missing header file dependencies
 (this branch is used by jn/makedepend and jn/master-makedepend.)

* jn/master-makedepend (2010-01-26) 0 commits
 (this branch uses jn/maint-makedepend; is used by jn/makedepend.)

This is to help merging the clean-up to "master".

* jn/makedepend (2010-01-31) 9 commits
 - Makefile: always remove .depend directories on 'make clean'
 - Makefile: tuck away generated makefile fragments in .depend
 - Teach Makefile to check header dependencies
 - Makefile: list standalone program object files in PROGRAM_OBJS
 - Makefile: lazily compute header dependencies
 - Makefile: list generated object files in OBJECTS
 - Makefile: disable default implicit rules
 - Makefile: rearrange dependency rules
 - Makefile: transport.o depends on branch.h now
 (this branch uses jn/maint-makedepend and jn/master-makedepend.)

And this is to build on top.
Looked ok for 'next'.

* jc/checkout-detached (2010-01-29) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-02-17 at 7e03edc)
 + Reword "detached HEAD" notification

* jc/maint-fix-test-perm (2010-01-30) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-02-16 at 9d2e037)
 + lib-patch-mode.sh: Fix permission
 + t6000lib: Fix permission

* jh/gitweb-caching (2010-01-30) 1 commit
 - gitweb: Add an option to force version match

The controversial one.  Will probably drop this.  RFC v3 of gitweb caching
series needs to be queued but hasn't happened yet.

* jn/makefile-script-lib (2010-01-31) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-02-16 at f5334f5)
 + Do not install shell libraries executable

Soon to graduate to 'master'.
