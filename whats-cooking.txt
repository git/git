What's cooking in git.git (Dec 2013, #02; Fri, 6)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.

The tip of 'next' has been rewound, ejecting a few topics that
used to be there.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

* ak/submodule-foreach-quoting (2013-09-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-10-14 at d77c5f1)
 + submodule foreach: skip eval for more than one argument

 A behavior change, but maybe a worthwhile one: "git submodule
 foreach" was treating its arguments as part of a single command to
 be concatenated and passed to a shell, making writing buggy scripts
 too easy.

 This patch preserves the old "just pass it to the shell" behavior
 when a single argument is passed to 'git submodule foreach' and
 moves to a new "skip the shell and use the arguments passed
 unmolested" behavior when more than one argument is passed.

 The old behavior (always concatenating and passing to the shell)
 was similar to the 'ssh' command, while the new behavior (switching
 on the number of arguments) is what 'xterm -e' does.

 May need more thought to make sure this change is advertised well;
 scripts that used multiple arguments but added their own extra
 layer of quoting are broken, and the users need to adjust them.


* bc/http-100-continue (2013-10-31) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-11-01 at e12ae23)
 + remote-curl: fix large pushes with GSSAPI
 + remote-curl: pass curl slot_results back through run_slot
 + http: return curl's AUTHAVAIL via slot_results

 Issue "100 Continue" responses to help use of GSS-Negotiate
 authentication scheme over HTTP transport when needed.


* jc/bundle (2013-11-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-11-21 at 535b046)
 + bundle: use argv-array

 Code clean-up.


* jc/merge-base-reflog (2013-10-29) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-11-01 at 6114764)
 + merge-base: teach "--fork-point" mode
 + merge-base: use OPT_CMDMODE and clarify the command line parsing

 Code the logic in "pull --rebase" that figures out a fork point
 from reflog entries in C.


* jc/ref-excludes (2013-11-01) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-11-04 at fac1ed0)
 + rev-parse: introduce --exclude=<glob> to tame wildcards
 + rev-list --exclude: export add/clear-ref-exclusion and ref-excluded API
 + rev-list --exclude: tests
 + document --exclude option
 + revision: introduce --exclude=<glob> to tame wildcards

 People often wished a way to tell "git log --branches" (and "git
 log --remotes --not --branches") to exclude some local branches
 from the expansion of "--branches" (similarly for "--tags", "--all"
 and "--glob=<pattern>").  Now they have one.


* jh/loose-object-dirs-creation-race (2013-10-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-11-01 at 3169b0f)
 + sha1_file.c:create_tmpfile(): Fix race when creating loose object dirs

 Two processes creating loose objects at the same time could have
 failed unnecessarily when they happened to have created objects
 whose names share the same first byte.


* jk/remove-experimental-loose-object-support (2013-11-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-11-21 at d37bab7)
 + drop support for "experimental" loose objects

 Read-only support for experimental loose-object format, in which
 users could optionally choose to write in their loose objects for a
 short while between v1.4.3 to v1.5.3 era, has been dropped.


* jk/replace-perl-in-built-scripts (2013-10-29) 1 commit

* jk/robustify-parse-commit (2013-10-24) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-11-01 at 2bfbaab)

 + use parse_commit_or_die instead of custom message
 + use parse_commit_or_die instead of segfaulting
 + assume parse_commit checks for NULL commit
 + assume parse_commit checks commit->object.parsed
 + log_tree_diff: die when we fail to parse a commit


* jk/two-way-merge-corner-case-fix (2013-11-04) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-11-04 at 79f4fb0)
 + t1005: add test for "read-tree --reset -u A B"
 + t1005: reindent
 + unpack-trees: fix "read-tree -u --reset A B" with conflicted index

 Fix a rather longstanding corner-case bug in twoway "reset to
 there" merge, which is most often seen in "git am --abort".


* jl/submodule-update-retire-orig-flags (2013-11-11) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-11-13 at 4b70d15)
 + submodule update: remove unnecessary orig_flags variable

 Code clean-up.


* jn/mediawiki-makefile-updates (2013-11-11) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-11-13 at 71c8d20)
 + git-remote-mediawiki build: handle DESTDIR/INSTLIBDIR with whitespace
 + git-remote-mediawiki build: make 'install' command configurable
 + git-remote-mediawiki: honor DESTDIR in "make install"
 + git-remote-mediawiki: do not remove installed files in "clean" target

 Build and installation procedure clean-up.


* jn/perl-lib-extra (2013-11-18) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-11-20 at 8c90afae)
 + Makefile: add PERLLIB_EXTRA variable that adds to default perl path
 + Makefile: rebuild perl scripts when perl paths change

 The new PERLLIB_EXTRA makefile variable can be used to specify
 additional directories Perl modules (e.g. the ones necessary to run
 git-svn) are installed on the platform when building.


* nd/magic-pathspec (2013-11-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-11-21 at f914a30)
 + diff: restrict pathspec limitations to diff b/f case only

 "git diff -- ':(icase)makefile'" was unnecessarily rejected at the
 command line parser.

 Needs to be merged to 'maint' later.


* nd/wt-status-align-i18n (2013-11-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-11-13 at b033aa0)
 + wt-status: take the alignment burden off translators

 An attempt to automatically align the names in the "git status"
 output, taking the display width of (translated) section labels
 into account.


* nv/parseopt-opt-arg (2013-10-31) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-11-01 at cd2afd9)
 + rev-parse --parseopt: add the --stuck-long mode
 + Use the word 'stuck' instead of 'sticked'

 Enhance "rev-parse --parseopt" mode to help parsing options with
 an optional parameter.


* rh/remote-hg-bzr-updates (2013-11-18) 8 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-11-20 at a36f3c4)
 + remote-bzr, remote-hg: fix email address regular expression
 + test-hg.sh: help user correlate verbose output with email test
 + test-hg.sh: fix duplicate content strings in author tests
 + test-hg.sh: avoid obsolete 'test' syntax
 + test-hg.sh: eliminate 'local' bashism
 + test-bzr.sh, test-hg.sh: prepare for change to push.default=simple
 + test-bzr.sh, test-hg.sh: allow running from any dir
 + test-lib.sh: convert $TEST_DIRECTORY to an absolute path


* rr/for-each-ref-decoration (2013-11-19) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-11-21 at ee7b0ed)
 + for-each-ref: avoid color leakage
 + for-each-ref: introduce %(color:...) for color
 + for-each-ref: introduce %(upstream:track[short])
 + for-each-ref: introduce %(HEAD) asterisk marker
 + t6300 (for-each-ref): don't hardcode SHA-1 hexes
 + t6300 (for-each-ref): clearly demarcate setup

 "git for-each-ref --format=..." learned a few formatting directives;
 e.g. "%(color:red)%(HEAD)%(color:reset) %(refname:short) %(subject)".


* sb/sha1-loose-object-info-check-existence (2013-11-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-11-06 at 1ea5b18)
 + sha1_loose_object_info(): do not return success on missing object

 "git cat-file --batch-check=ok" did not check the existence of the
 named object.

* fc/transport-helper-fixes (2013-11-13) 12 commits
 - remote-bzr: support the new 'force' option
 - transport-helper: add support to delete branches
 - fast-export: add support to delete refs
 - fast-import: add support to delete refs
 - transport-helper: add support for old:new refspec
 - fast-export: add new --refspec option
 - fast-export: improve argument parsing
 - test-hg.sh: tests are now expected to pass
 - transport-helper: check for 'forced update' message
 - transport-helper: add 'force' to 'export' helpers
 - transport-helper: don't update refs in dry-run
 - transport-helper: mismerge fix

 Updates transport-helper, fast-import and fast-export to allow the
 ref mapping and ref deletion in a way similar to the natively
 supported transports.

 The option name "--refspec" needs to be rethought. It does not mean
 what refspec usually means, even though it shares the same syntax
 with refspec; calling it --refspec only because it shares the same
 syntax is like calling it --asciistring and does not make sense.


* nv/commit-gpgsign-config (2013-11-06) 1 commit
 - Add the commit.gpgsign option to sign all commits

 Introduce commit.gpgsign configuration variable to force every
 commit to be GPG signed.

 Needs tests, perhaps?


* jt/commit-fixes-footer (2013-10-30) 1 commit
 - commit: Add -f, --fixes <commit> option to add Fixes: line

 There is an ongoing discussion around this topic; in general I am
 fairly negative on a new feature that is too narrow and prefer a
 more generic solution that can be tailored for specific needs, as
 many people stated in the thread.

 It appears that the discussion stalled.


* np/pack-v4 (2013-09-18) 90 commits
 . packv4-parse.c: add tree offset caching
 . t1050: replace one instance of show-index with verify-pack
 . index-pack, pack-objects: allow creating .idx v2 with .pack v4
 . unpack-objects: decode v4 trees
 . unpack-objects: allow to save processed bytes to a buffer
 - ...

 Nico and Duy advancing the eternal vaporware pack-v4.  This is here
 primarily for wider distribution of the preview edition.

 Temporarily ejected from 'pu', to try out jk/pack-bitmap, which
 this topic conflicts with.


* jk/pack-bitmap (2013-11-18) 22 commits
 - compat/mingw.h: Fix the MinGW and msvc builds
 - pack-bitmap: implement optional name_hash cache
 - t/perf: add tests for pack bitmaps
 - t: add basic bitmap functionality tests
 - count-objects: recognize .bitmap in garbage-checking
 - repack: consider bitmaps when performing repacks
 - repack: handle optional files created by pack-objects
 - repack: turn exts array into array-of-struct
 - repack: stop using magic number for ARRAY_SIZE(exts)
 - pack-objects: implement bitmap writing
 - rev-list: add bitmap mode to speed up object lists
 - pack-objects: use bitmaps when packing objects
 - pack-bitmap: add support for bitmap indexes
 - documentation: add documentation for the bitmap format
 - ewah: compressed bitmap implementation
 - compat: add endianness helpers
 - sha1_file: export `git_open_noatime`
 - revision: allow setting custom limiter function
 - pack-objects: factor out name_hash
 - pack-objects: refactor the packing list
 - revindex: export new APIs
 - sha1write: make buffer const-correct
 (this branch is tangled with jk/name-pack-after-byte-representation.)

 Borrows the bitmap index into packfiles from JGit to speed up
 enumeration of objects involved in a commit range without having to
 fully traverse the history.


* mf/graph-show-root (2013-10-25) 1 commit
 . graph.c: mark root commit differently

 In a repository with multiple-roots, "log --graph", especially with
 "--oneline", does not give the reader enough visual cue to see
 where one line of history ended and a separate history began.

 This is the version that marks the roots 'x' when they would have
 been marked as '*'; Keshav Kini suggested an alternative of giving
 an extra blank line after every root, which I tend to think is a
 better approach to the problem.


* tg/perf-lib-test-perf-cleanup (2013-09-19) 2 commits
 - perf-lib: add test_perf_cleanup target
 - perf-lib: split starting the test from the execution

 Add test_perf_cleanup shell function to the perf suite, that allows
 the script writers to define a test with a clean-up action.

 Holding until needed.


* yt/shortened-rename (2013-10-18) 2 commits
 - SQUASH??? style fixes and s/omit/shorten/ where appropriate
 - diff.c: keep arrow(=>) on show_stats()'s shortened filename part to make rename visible

 Attempts to give more weight on the fact that a filepair represents
 a rename than showing substring of the actual path when diffstat
 lines are not wide enough.

 I am not sure if that is solving a right problem, though.


* rv/send-email-cache-generated-mid (2013-08-21) 2 commits
 - git-send-email: Cache generated message-ids, use them when prompting
 - git-send-email: add optional 'choices' parameter to the ask sub


* rj/read-default-config-in-show-ref-pack-refs (2013-06-17) 3 commits
 - ### DONTMERGE: needs better explanation on what config they need
 - pack-refs.c: Add missing call to git_config()
 - show-ref.c: Add missing call to git_config()

 The changes themselves are probably good, but it is unclear what
 basic setting needs to be read for which exact operation.

 Waiting for clarification.
 $gmane/228294


* jc/format-patch (2013-04-22) 2 commits
 - format-patch: --inline-single
 - format-patch: rename "no_inline" field

 A new option to send a single patch to the standard output to be
 appended at the bottom of a message.  I personally have no need for
 this, but it was easy enough to cobble together.  Tests, docs and
 stripping out more MIMEy stuff are left as exercises to interested
 parties.


* jk/gitweb-utf8 (2013-04-08) 4 commits
 - gitweb: Fix broken blob action parameters on blob/commitdiff pages
 - gitweb: Don't append ';js=(0|1)' to external links
 - gitweb: Make feed title valid utf8
 - gitweb: Fix utf8 encoding for blob_plain, blobdiff_plain, commitdiff_plain, and patch

 Various fixes to gitweb.

 Drew Northup volunteered to take a look into this.
 $gmane/226216


* jc/show-branch (2013-06-07) 5 commits
 - show-branch: use commit slab to represent bitflags of arbitrary width
 - show-branch.c: remove "all_mask"
 - show-branch.c: abstract out "flags" operation
 - show-branch.c: lift all_mask/all_revs to a global static
 - show-branch.c: update comment style

 Waiting for the final step to lift the hard-limit before sending it out.

* cc/starts-n-ends-with (2013-12-05) 4 commits
 - replace {pre,suf}fixcmp() with {starts,ends}_with()
 - strbuf: introduce starts_with() and ends_with()
 - builtin/remote: remove postfixcmp() and use suffixcmp() instead
 - environment: normalize use of prefixcmp() by removing " != 0"
 (this branch is used by cc/starts-n-ends-with-endgame; uses jk/remove-deprecated.)

 Remove a few duplicate implementations of prefix/suffix comparison
 functions, and rename them to starts_with and ends_with.

 To avoid unnecessary merge conflicts, this is queued on top of
 jk/remove-deprecated topic.


* cc/starts-n-ends-with-endgame (2013-12-05) 1 commit
 - strbuf: remove prefixcmp() and suffixcmp()
 (this branch uses cc/starts-n-ends-with and jk/remove-deprecated.)

 Endgame for the above topic, that needs to be evil-merged with
 other topics that introduce new uses of prefix/suffix-cmp
 functions.


* jc/push-refmap (2013-12-04) 3 commits
 - push: also use "upstream" mapping when pushing a single ref
 - push: use remote.$name.push as a refmap
 - builtin/push.c: use strbuf instead of manual allocation

 Make "git push origin master" update the same ref that would be
 updated by our 'master' when "git push origin" (no refspecs) is run
 while the 'master' branch is checked out, which makes "git push"
 more symmetric to "git fetch" and more usable for the triangular
 workflow.

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-11-21

 + t5510: prepare test refs more straightforwardly
 + t5510: use the correct tag name in test

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-11-06

 The "--tags" option to "git fetch" used to be literally a synonym to
 a "refs/tags/*:refs/tags/*" refspec, which meant that (1) as an
 explicit refspec given from the command line, it silenced the lazy
 "git fetch" default that is configured, and (2) also as an explicit
 refspec given from the command line, it interacted with "--prune"
 to remove any tag that the remote we are fetching from does not
 have.

 This demotes it to an option; with it, we fetch all tags in
 addition to what would be fetched without the option, and it does
 not interact with the decision "--prune" makes to see what
 remote-tracking refs the local has are missing the remote

* th/reflog-annotated-tag (2013-10-28) 1 commit
 . reflog: handle lightweight and annotated tags equally

 "git log -g $annotated_tag", when there is no reflog history, should
 have produced a single output entry (i.e. the ref creation event),
 but instead showed the history leading to the tag.

 Broken at the design level.  Any reflog entry that points at a non
 commit needs to be handled with new code that does not exist yet,
 and lifting the "this code handles only commits" without adding
 such code does not solve anything.
