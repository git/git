What's cooking in git.git (Jan 2022, #04; Fri, 14)
--------------------------------------------------

I just tagged Git 2.35-rc1 with a few last-minute fixes.  Let's make
sure we can find and fix any remaining regressions introduced during
this cycle before the final.

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen',
which means nothing more than that I have found them of interest for
some reason (like "it may have hard-to-resolve conflicts with
another topic already in flight" or "this may turn out to be
useful").  Do not read too much into a topic being in (or not in)
'seen'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of the
integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

Release tarballs are available at:

* je/http-better-error-output (2021-12-03) 1 commit
 . http-backend: give a hint that web browser access is not supported

 When the http-backend program, which is the server-side component
 for the smart HTTP transport, sends a "404 Not found" error, we
 deliberately did not say anything to the requesting client.  We now
 send a message back to the browser to tell the user that they do
 not want to visit the URL via their browser, instead of a totally
 blank page.

 Expecting a reroll.

 - config: add repo_config_set_worktree_gently()
 - worktree: add 'init-worktree-config' subcommand

 "git sparse-checkout" wants to work with per-worktree configration,
 but did not work well in a worktree attached to a bare repository.

 - fetch --negotiate-only: do not update submodules
 - fetch: skip tasks related to fetching objects
 - fetch: use goto cleanup in cmd_fetch()

 "git fetch --nogotiate-only" is an internal command used by "git
 push" to figure out which part of our history is missing from the
 other side.  It should never recurse into submodules even when
 fetch.recursesubmodules configuration variable is set, nor it
 should trigger "gc".  The code has been tightened up to ensure it
 only does common ancestry discovery and nothing else.

 Almost there.

 . refs: do not execute reference-transaction hook on packing refs
 . refs: demonstrate excessive execution of the reference-transaction hook
 . refs: allow skipping the reference-transaction hook
 . refs: allow passing flags when beginning transactions
 . refs: open-code deletion of packed refs

 Because a deletion of ref would need to remove it from both the
 loose ref store and the packed ref store, a delete-ref operation
 that logically removes one ref may end up invoking ref-transaction
 hook twice, which has been corrected.

 "git apply" (ab)used the util pointer of the string-list to keep

 - ls-tree.c: introduce "--format" option
 - cocci: allow padding with `strbuf_addf()`
 - ls-tree.c: introduce struct "show_tree_data"
 - ls-tree.c: support --object-only option for "git-ls-tree"
 - ls-tree: optimize naming and handling of "return" in show_tree()
 - ls-tree: use "size_t", not "int" for "struct strbuf"'s "len"
 - ls-tree: use "enum object_type", not {blob,tree,commit}_type

 "git ls-tree" learns "--oid-only" option, similar to "--name-only",
 and more generalized "--format" option.

 . fixup! keyword expansion: make "$Id$" string configurable
