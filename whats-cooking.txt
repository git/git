What's cooking in git.git (Apr 2024, #06; Wed, 17)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and
aren't considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL
to a message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity (of course they can be resubmit when new interests
arise).

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-scm/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/

 + rerere: fix crashes due to unmatched opening conflict markers

 When .git/rr-cache/ rerere database gets corrupted or rerere is fed to
 work on a file with conflicted hunks resolved incompletely, the rerere
 machinery got confused and segfaulted, which has been corrected.

 When "git bisect" reports the commit it determined to be the

 UI tweaks, like log.date and log.decorate.  The code has been
 taught to use "git show" to follow more customizations.

 Git writes a "waiting for your editor" message on an incomplete
 line after launching an editor, and then append another error
 message on the same line if the editor errors out.  It now clears
 the "waiting for..." line before giving the error message.

 - pack-bitmap-write.c: write pseudo-merge table
 - pack-bitmap-write.c: select pseudo-merge commits
 - pseudo-merge: implement support for selecting pseudo-merge commits
 - pack-bitmap: make `bitmap_writer_push_bitmapped_commit()` public
 - pack-bitmap: implement `bitmap_writer_has_bitmapped_object_id()`
 - pack-bitmap-write: support storing pseudo-merge commits
 - pseudo-merge.ch: initial commit
 - pack-bitmap: move some initialization to `bitmap_writer_init()`
 - pack-bitmap: drop unused `max_bitmaps` parameter
 - ewah: implement `ewah_bitmap_is_subset()`
 - config: repo_config_get_expiry()
 - Documentation/technical: describe pseudo-merge bitmaps format

 The pack-bitmap machinery learned to write pseudo-merge bitmaps,
 which act as imaginary octopus merges covering un-bitmapped
 reference tips. This enhances bitmap coverage, and thus,
 performance, for repositories with many references using bitmaps.

 Expecting a reroll.

 - fuzz: link fuzz programs with `make all` on Linux
 - ci: also define CXX environment variable

 In addition to building the objects needed, try to link the objects
 that are used in fuzzer tests, to make sure at least they build
 without bitrot, in Linux CI runs.

 Expecting a hopefully minor and final reroll.
