What's cooking in git.git (Mar 2018, #02; Tue, 6)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

[Graduated to "master"]

* ab/fetch-prune (2018-02-09) 17 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-27 at eafb648dd9)
 + fetch: make the --prune-tags work with <url>
 + fetch: add a --prune-tags option and fetch.pruneTags config
 + fetch tests: add scaffolding for the new fetch.pruneTags
 + git-fetch & config doc: link to the new PRUNING section
 + git remote doc: correct dangerous lies about what prune does
 + git fetch doc: add a new section to explain the ins & outs of pruning
 + fetch tests: fetch <url> <spec> as well as fetch [<remote>]
 + fetch tests: expand case/esac for later change
 + fetch tests: double quote a variable for interpolation
 + fetch tests: test --prune and refspec interaction
 + fetch tests: add a tag to be deleted to the pruning tests
 + fetch tests: re-arrange arguments for future readability
 + fetch tests: refactor in preparation for testing tag pruning
 + remote: add a macro for "refs/tags/*:refs/tags/*"
 + fetch: stop accessing "remote" variable indirectly
 + fetch: trivially refactor assignment to ref_nr
 + fetch: don't redundantly NULL something calloc() gave us

 "git fetch --prune-tags" may be used as a handy short-hand for
 getting rid of stale tags that are locally held.


* ab/simplify-perl-makefile (2018-02-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-27 at b0d68a2013)

 We now avoid using identifiers that clash with C++ keywords.  Even though
 it is not a goal to compile Git with C++ compilers, changes like
 this help use of code analysis tools that targets C++ on our
 codebase.


* bw/doc-submodule-recurse-config-with-clone (2018-02-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-27 at 5b12841508)
 + submodule: indicate that 'submodule.recurse' doesn't apply to clone

 Doc update.


* bw/perl-timegm-timelocal-fix (2018-02-23) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-27 at 565a3141ce)
 + perl: call timegm and timelocal with 4-digit year

 Y2k20 fix ;-) for our perl scripts.


* jc/allow-ff-merging-kept-tags (2018-02-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-27 at 8b03610d2b)
 + merge: allow fast-forward when merging a tracked tag

 Since Git 1.7.9, "git merge" defaulted to --no-ff (i.e. even when
 the side branch being merged is a descendant of the current commit,
 create a merge commit instead of fast-forwarding) when merging a
 tag object.  This was appropriate default for integrators who pull
 signed tags from their downstream contributors, but caused an
 unnecessary merges when used by downstream contributors who
 habitually "catch up" their topic branches with tagged releases
 from the upstream.  Update "git merge" to default to --no-ff only
 when merging a tag object that does *not* sit at its usual place in
 refs/tags/ hierarchy, and allow fast-forwarding otherwise, to
 mitigate the problem.


* jk/cached-commit-buffer (2018-02-22) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-27 at af791d9a1e)
 + revision: drop --show-all option
 + commit: drop uses of get_cached_commit_buffer()

 Code clean-up.


* jk/strbuf-read-file-close-error (2018-02-23) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-27 at c5dfe33335)
 + strbuf_read_file(): preserve errno across close() call

 Code clean-up.


* jk/test-helper-v-output-fix (2018-02-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-27 at c9109977e8)
 + t: send verbose test-helper output to fd 4

 Test framework update.


* ms/non-ascii-ticks (2018-02-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-27 at 41159fc4f0)
 + Documentation/gitsubmodules.txt: avoid non-ASCII apostrophes

 Doc markup fix.


* nd/rebase-show-current-patch (2018-02-12) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-27 at 5a4e23a77c)
 + rebase: introduce and use pseudo-ref REBASE_HEAD
 + rebase: add --show-current-patch
 + am: add --show-current-patch

 The new "--show-current-patch" option gives an end-user facing way
 to get the diff being applied when "git rebase" (and "git am")
 stops with a conflict.


* nm/tag-edit (2018-02-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-27 at 3bc8345213)
 + tag: add --edit option

 "git tag" learned an explicit "--edit" option that allows the
 message given via "-m" and "-F" to be further edited.


* pw/add-p-single (2018-02-13) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-27 at 0e2bd585e3)
 + add -p: improve error messages
 + add -p: only bind search key if there's more than one hunk
 + add -p: only display help for active keys

 "git add -p" used to offer "/" (look for a matching hunk) as a
 choice, even there was only one hunk, which has been corrected.
 Also the single-key help is now given only for keys that are
 enabled (e.g. help for '/' won't be shown when there is only one
 hunk).


* rs/strbuf-read-file-or-whine (2018-02-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-27 at 56017cb5e2)

 (this branch is used by sb/blame-color.)

 Devdoc update.


* sg/t6300-modernize (2018-02-13) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-27 at b6f13b6915)
 + t6300-for-each-ref: fix "more than one quoting style" tests

 Test update.


* sm/mv-dry-run-update (2018-02-07) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-27 at 17eef62ddf)
 + mv: remove unneeded 'if (!show_only)'
 + t7001: add test case for --dry-run

 Code clean-up.


* xz/send-email-batch-size (2018-02-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-27 at da0247d532)
 + send-email: error out when relogin delay is missing

 "git send-email" learned to complain when the batch-size option is
 not defined when the relogin-delay option is, since these two are
 mutually required.

* dj/runtime-prefix (2017-12-05) 4 commits
 . exec_cmd: RUNTIME_PREFIX on some POSIX systems
 . Makefile: add Perl runtime prefix support
 . Makefile: add support for "perllibdir"
 . Makefile: generate Perl header from template file

 A build-time option has been added to allow Git to be told to refer
 to its associated files relative to the main binary, in the same
 way that has been possible on Windows for quite some time, for
 Linux, BSDs and Darwin.

 Perhaps it is about time to reboot the effort?

 - SQUASH???
 - t5560-http-backend-noserver.sh: add CONTENT_LENGTH cases
 - SQUASH???
 - http-backend: respect CONTENT_LENGTH as specified by rfc3875

 The http-backend (used for smart-http transport) used to slurp the
 whole input until EOF, without paying attention to CONTENT_LENGTH
 that is supplied in the environment and instead expecting the Web
 server to close the input stream.  This has been fixed.

 Expecting a reroll.
 Suggested fixes to be used when rerolling is queued, but I'd
 prefer _not_ squashing them myself.

 Also, it may be too complex solution for the problem.

* cc/require-tcl-tk-for-build (2017-11-29) 2 commits
 - travis-ci: avoid new tcl/tk build requirement
 - Makefile: check that tcl/tk is installed

 A first-time builder of Git may have installed neither tclsh nor
 msgfmt, in which case git-gui and gitk part will fail and break the
 build.  As a workaround, refuse to run a build when tclsh is not
 installed and NO_TCLTK is not set.

 Stalled for too long without any response; will discard.
 I still feel that requring tclsh to be installed, with or without
 "escape hatch" for experts, may be too heavy-handed.


* mg/merge-base-fork-point (2017-09-17) 3 commits
 - merge-base: find fork-point outside partial reflog
 - merge-base: return fork-point outside reflog
 - t6010: test actual test output

 "merge-base --fork-point $branch $commit" is used to guess on which
 commit among the commits that were once at the tip of the $branch the
 $commit was built on top of, and it learns these historical tips from
 the reflog of the $branch.  When the true fork-point is lost due to
 pruning of old reflog entries, the command does not give any output,
 because it has no way to guess correctly and does not want to mislead
 the user with a wrong guess.

 The command has been updated to give the best but not known to be
 correct guess, based on a hope that a merge-base between $commit and a
 virtual merge across all the reflog entries that still are available
 for $branch may still be a closer to the true fork-point than the
 merge-base between $commit and the current tip of the $branch.

 This may have to be offered by an additional option, to allow the
 users that are prepared to see a potentially incorrect guess to opt
 into the feature, without affecting the current callers that may not
 be prepared to accept a guess that is not known to be correct.

 Stalled for too long without any response; will discard.


* jk/drop-ancient-curl (2017-08-09) 5 commits
 - http: #error on too-old curl
 - curl: remove ifdef'd code never used with curl >=7.19.4
 - http: drop support for curl < 7.19.4
 - http: drop support for curl < 7.16.0
 - http: drop support for curl < 7.11.1

 Some code in http.c that has bitrot is being removed.

 Expecting a reroll.


* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2017-08-10) 1 commit
 . zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

 Needs resurrecting by making sure the fix is good and still applies
 (or adjusted to today's codebase).


* mg/status-in-progress-info (2017-05-10) 2 commits
 - status --short --inprogress: spell it as --in-progress
 - status: show in-progress info for short status

 "git status" learns an option to report various operations
 (e.g. "merging") that the user is in the middle of.

 Stalled for too long without any response; will discard.

  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-02 at 29e1585ae7)
 + travis-ci: build Git during the 'script' phase

 Build the executable in 'script' phase in Travis CI integration, to
 follow the established practice, rather than during 'before_script'
 phase.  This allows the CI categorize the failures better ('failed'
 is project's fault, 'errored' is build environment's).

 (this branch is used by ma/skip-writing-unchanged-index.)

 Some codepaths used to take a lockfile and did not roll it back;
 they are automatically rolled back at program exit, so there is no

* sg/test-x (2018-02-28) 11 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-06 at ab0684b27c)
 + travis-ci: run tests with '-x' tracing
 + t/README: add a note about don't saving stderr of compound commands
 + t1510-repo-setup: mark as untraceable with '-x'
 + t9903-bash-prompt: don't check the stderr of __git_ps1()
 + t5570-git-daemon: don't check the stderr of a subshell
 + t5526: use $TRASH_DIRECTORY to specify the path of GIT_TRACE log file
 + t5500-fetch-pack: don't check the stderr of a subshell
 + t3030-merge-recursive: don't check the stderr of a subshell
 + t1507-rev-parse-upstream: don't check the stderr of a shell function
 + t: add means to disable '-x' tracing for individual test scripts
 + t: prevent '-x' tracing from interfering with test helpers' stderr

 Running test scripts under -x option of the shell is often not a
 useful way to debug them, because the error messages from the
 commands tests try to capture and inspect are contaminated by the
 tracing output by the shell.  An earlier work done to make it more
 pleasant to run tests under -x with recent versions of bash is
 extended to cover posix shells that do not support BASH_XTRACEFD.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ab/gc-auto-in-commit (2018-03-01) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-02 at 96a5a4d629)
 + commit: run git gc --auto just before the post-commit hook

 "git commit" used to run "gc --auto" near the end, which was lost
 when the command was reimplemented in C by mistake.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ab/pre-auto-gc-battery (2018-02-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-06 at ca9cb273cb)
 + hooks/pre-auto-gc-battery: allow gc to run on non-laptops

 A sample auto-gc hook (in contrib/) to skip auto-gc while on
 battery has been updated to almost always allow running auto-gc
 unless on_ac_power command is absolutely sure that we are on
 battery power (earlier, it skipped unless the command is sure that
 we are on ac power).

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ag/userdiff-go-funcname (2018-03-01) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-02 at ea404d1be9)
 + userdiff: add built-in pattern for golang

 "git diff" and friends learned funcname patterns for Go language
 source files.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ma/skip-writing-unchanged-index (2018-03-01) 1 commit
 - write_locked_index(): add flag to avoid writing unchanged index
 (this branch uses ma/roll-back-lockfiles.)

 Internal API clean-up to allow write_locked_index() optionally skip
 writing the in-core index when it is not modified.

 May want to merge into ma/roll-back-lockfiles topic before merging
 to 'next'.


* jh/status-no-ahead-behind (2018-01-24) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-02 at 68bde8d571)
 + status: support --no-ahead-behind in long format
 + status: update short status to respect --no-ahead-behind
 + status: add --[no-]ahead-behind to status and commit for V2 format.
 + stat_tracking_info: return +1 when branches not equal

 "git status" can spend a lot of cycles to compute the relation
 between the current branch and its upstream, which can now be
 disabled with "--no-ahead-behind" option.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* nd/tilde-expand-opt-file-value (2018-02-14) 2 commits
 - init-db: change --template type to OPTION_FILENAME
 - parse-options: expand $HOME on filename options

 "git cmd --opt=~u/path/to/file" did not tilde-expand "~u" part to
 the path to the home directory of user 'u'

 Will discard.
 This may make the resulting whole more confusing, though.

 Clean-up to various pieces of Perl code we have.

 WIll merge to 'next'.

 - commit-graph: read only from specific pack-indexes
 - commit: integrate commit graph with commit parsing
 - commit-graph: close under reachability

* ot/ref-filter-cleanup (2018-02-21) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-02 at 3b4c39a4b5)
 + ref-filter: get rid of goto
 + ref-filter: get rid of duplicate code

 Code cleanup.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ma/config-page-only-in-list-mode (2018-02-21) 3 commits
 - config: change default of `pager.config` to "on"
 - config: respect `pager.config` in list/get-mode only
 - t7006: add tests for how git config paginates

 In a way similar to how "git tag" learned to honor the pager
 setting only in the list mode, "git config" learned to ignore the
 pager setting when it is used for setting values (i.e. when the
 purpose of the operation is not to "show").

 Is this ready for 'next'?


* pw/add-p-recount (2018-03-05) 9 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-06 at 68952f9bb0)
 + add -p: don't rely on apply's '--recount' option
 + add -p: fix counting when splitting and coalescing
 + add -p: calculate offset delta for edited patches
 + add -p: adjust offsets of subsequent hunks when one is skipped
 + t3701: add failing test for pathological context lines
 + t3701: don't hard code sha1 hash values
 + t3701: use test_write_lines and write_script
 + t3701: indent here documents
 + add -i: add function to format hunk header
 (this branch is used by pw/add-p-select.)

 "git add -p" has been lazy in coalescing split patches before
 passing the result to underlying "git apply", leading to corner
 case bugs; the logic to prepare the patch to be applied after hunk
 selections has been tightened.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* bp/untracked-cache-noflush (2018-02-28) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-02 at 709887971b)
 + untracked cache: use git_env_bool() not getenv() for customization
 + dir.c: don't flag the index as dirty for changes to the untracked cache

 Writing out the index file when the only thing that changed in it
 is the untracked cache information is often wasteful, and this has
 been optimized out.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* nd/diff-stat-with-summary (2018-02-27) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-06 at d543f92f5e)
 + diff: add --compact-summary
 + diff.c: refactor pprint_rename() to use strbuf

 "git diff" and friends learned "--compact-summary" that shows the
 information usually given with the "--summary" option on the same
 line as the diffstat output of the "--stat" option (which saves
 vertical space and keeps info on a single path at the same place).

 Will merge to 'master'.


* nd/parseopt-completion (2018-03-06) 44 commits
 - SQUASH???

 "git worktree add" learned to check out an existing branch.

 Expecting a reroll.

 + directory rename detection: testcases to avoid taking detection too far
 + directory rename detection: directory splitting testcases
 + directory rename detection: basic testcases

 Rename detection logic in "diff" family that is used in "merge" has
 learned to guess when all of x/a, x/b and x/c have moved to z/a,
 z/b and z/c, it is likely that x/d added in the meantime would also
 want to move to z/d by taking the hint that the entire directory
 'x' moved to 'z'.  A bug causing dirty files involved in a rename
 to be overwritten during merge has also been fixed as part of this
 work.

 Will merge to 'master'.
