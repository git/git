What's cooking in git.git (Mar 2022, #01; Thu, 3)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen',
which means nothing more than that I have found them of interest for
some reason (like "it may have hard-to-resolve conflicts with
another topic already in flight" or "this may turn out to be
useful").  Do not read too much into a topic being in (or not in)
'seen'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of the
integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/

* je/http-better-error-output (2021-12-03) 1 commit
 . http-backend: give a hint that web browser access is not supported

 When the http-backend program, which is the server-side component
 for the smart HTTP transport, sends a "404 Not found" error, we
 deliberately did not say anything to the requesting client.  We now
 send a message back to the browser to tell the user that they do
 not want to visit the URL via their browser, instead of a totally
 blank page.

* fs/gpgsm-update (2022-03-02) 3 commits
 - t/lib-gpg: kill all gpg components, not just gpg-agent
 - t/lib-gpg: reload gpg components after updating trustlist
 - gpg-interface/gpgsm: fix for v2.3

 Newer version of GPGSM changed its output in a backward
 incompatible way to break our code that parses its output.  It also
 added more processes our tests need to kill when cleaning up.
 Adjustments have been made to accomodate these changes.
