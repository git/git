What's cooking in git.git (Feb 2021, #01; Wed, 3)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'seen' (formerly 'pu'---proposed updates) while commits prefixed
with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

A bit more topics are on 'master' now.  Also for those of us who are
on 'next', Derrick's fixes on top of the corrected commit date
series may help incremental commit-graph updates.  Testing is
appreciated.  I have been shooting for parking any non-trivial topic
that has been reviewed positively in 'next' for about 7 calendar
days, which may have been a bit too aggressive (on the other hand,
trivial topofixes, clean-ups and doc updates do not have to wait all
that long).

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jh/simple-ipc (2021-02-01) 13 commits
 - simple-ipc: add Unix domain socket implementation

 - pkt-line: add write_packetized_from_buf2() that takes scratch buffer
 - pkt-line: promote static buffer in packet_write_gently() to callers

 A simple IPC interface gets introduced to build services like
 fsmonitor on top.


* ab/pager-exit-log (2021-02-01) 4 commits
 - pager: properly log pager exit code when signalled
 - run-command: add braces for "if" block in wait_or_whine()
 - pager: test for exit code with and without SIGPIPE
 - pager: refactor wait_for_pager() function

 When a pager spawned by us exited, the trace log did not record its
 exit status correctly, which has been corrected.


* jk/complete-branch-force-delete (2021-02-03) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-03 at 6454bb89b5)
 + doc/git-branch: fix awkward wording for "-c"
 + completion: handle other variants of "branch -m"
 + completion: treat "branch -D" the same way as "branch -d"

 The command line completion (in contrib/) completed "git branch -d"
 with branch names, but "git branch -D" offered tagnames in addition,
 which has been corrected.  "git branch -M" had the same problem.

 Will merge to 'master'.

* mt/rm-sparse-checkout (2020-12-08) 1 commit
 - rm: honor sparse checkout patterns
 (this branch uses mt/grep-sparse-checkout.)

 "git rm" follows suit to "git grep" to ignore paths outside the
 sparsity pattern when the sparse checkout feature is in use.

 Need to wait for how these fit in larger picture.

 - fsck: complain when .gitattributes or .gitignore is a symlink
 - verify_path(): disallow symlinks in .gitattributes and .gitignore
 - t0060: test obscured .gitattributes and .gitignore matching

 - t7450: test verify_path() handling of gitmodules
 - t7415: rename to expand scope
 - fsck_tree(): wrap some long lines
 - fsck_tree(): fix shadowed variable

 "git fsck" and the corresponding check done during the transport
 learned to ensure that in-tree files like `.gitignore` and
 `.gitattributes` are not symbolic links.

 It seems that there are real projects with .gitignore recorded as
 symlinks, which may need to loosen the fsck setting.  Do we need to
 introduce a class that is separate from symlinked .gitmodules that
 has potential consequences that is more/less grave, so that these
 projects can opt out of the new checks?


* sm/curl-retry (2020-10-13) 3 commits
 - http: automatically retry some requests
 - replace CURLOPT_FILE With CURLOPT_WRITEDATA
 - remote-curl: add testing for intelligent retry for HTTP

 The http transport has been taught to retry a failed request that
 may reasonably be retried.

 by soliciting objections.

 On hold for now.


* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2018-10-15) 1 commit
 - zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

 - merge-one-file: rewrite in C
 - update-index: move add_cacheinfo() to read-cache.c
 - t6060: modify multiple files to expose a possible issue with merge-index

 - commit-reach: use one walk in remove_redundant()
 - commit-reach: reduce requirements for remove_redundant()
 (this branch uses ak/corrected-commit-date; is tangled with ds/chunked-file-api and ds/commit-graph-genno-fix.)

 The code to implement "git merge-base --independent" was poorly

 We've carried compatibility codepaths for compilers without
 variadic macros for quite some time, but the world may be ready for
 them to be removed.  Force compilation failure on exotic platforms
 where variadic macros are not available to find out who screams in
 such a way that we can easily revert if it turns out that the world

 Our setting of GitHub CI test jobs were a bit too eager to give up

 - mergetool: break setup_tool out into separate initialization function

* tb/precompose-prefix-too (2021-02-03) 1 commit
 - MacOS: precompose_argv_prefix()

 When commands are started from a subdirectory, they may have to
 compare the path to the subdirectory (called prefix and found out
 from $(pwd)) with the tracked paths.  On macOS, $(pwd) and
 readdir() yield decomposed path, while the tracked paths are
 usually normalized to the precomposed form, causing mismatch.  This
 has been fixed by taking the same approach used to normalize the
 command line arguments.

 + use delete_refs when deleting tags or branches

 When removing many branches and tags, the code used to do so one

* jt/transfer-fsck-across-packs (2021-01-25) 5 commits
 - SQUASH??? test fix
 - fetch-pack: print and use dangling .gitmodules
 - fetch-pack: with packfile URIs, use index-pack arg
 - http-fetch: allow custom index-pack args
 - http: allow custom index-pack args

 The approach to "fsck" the incoming objects in "index-pack" is
 attractive for performance reasons (we have them already in core,
 inflated and ready to be inspected), but fundamentally cannot be
 applied fully when we receive more than one pack stream, as a tree
 object in one pack may refer to a blob object in another pack as
 ".gitmodules", when we want to inspect blobs that are used as
 ".gitmodules" file, for example.  Teach "index-pack" to emit
 objects that must be inspected later and check them in the calling
 "fetch-pack" process.


* jv/pack-objects-narrower-ref-iteration (2021-01-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-01-26 at 8a0d178c01)
 + builtin/pack-objects.c: avoid iterating all refs

 The "pack-objects" command needs to iterate over all the tags when
 automatic tag following is enabled, but it actually iterated over
 all refs and then discarded everything outside "refs/tags/"
 hierarchy, which was quite wasteful.

* bc/signed-objects-with-both-hashes (2021-01-18) 6 commits
 - gpg-interface: remove other signature headers before verifying
 - ref-filter: hoist signature parsing
 - commit: allow parsing arbitrary buffers with headers
 - gpg-interface: improve interface for parsing tags

 two object names (one in SHA-1, the other in SHA-256) are both
 signed.

 Looking good.

 + rebase -i: do leave commit message intact in fixup! chains

 When "git rebase -i" processes "fixup" insn, there is no reason to
 clean up the commit log message, but we did the usual stripspace
 processing.  This has been corrected.

* jt/clone-unborn-head (2021-02-01) 3 commits
 - clone: respect remote unborn HEAD
 - connect, transport: encapsulate arg in struct
 - ls-refs: report unborn targets of symrefs

 "git clone" tries to locally check out the branch pointed at by
 HEAD of the remote repository after it is done, but the protocol
 did not convey the information necessary to do so when copying an
 empty repository.  The protocol v2 learned how to do so.

 Looking good, modulo some minor documentation nits.
