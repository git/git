What's cooking in git.git (Apr 2013, #07; Mon, 22)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.

Both of the two topics on preparing "git add" users for the
behaviour change in Git 2.0 are in 'master'.  We may want to tweak
the wording of warning messages and such before the feature freeze.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* ap/strbuf-humanize (2013-04-10) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-14 at 66d7af5)
 + count-objects: add -H option to humanize sizes
 + strbuf: create strbuf_humanise_bytes() to show byte sizes

 Teach "--human-readable" aka "-H" option to "git count-objects" to
 show various large numbers in Ki/Mi/GiB scaled as necessary.

 I've decided to let this topic supersede mc/count-objects-kibibytes.
 Human users will get an even easier output with "-H" and by not
 changing the output without an explicit option we do not have to
 break third-party tools that may have been reading from the output
 of this command.


* as/clone-reference-with-gitfile (2013-04-09) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-15 at ab0d128)

 + run-command: use thread-aware die_is_recursing routine
 + usage: allow pluggable die-recursion checks

 A regression fix for the logic to detect die() handler triggering
 itself recursively.

  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-19 at ecec2d4)
 + blame: handle broken commit headers gracefully
 + pretty: handle broken commit headers gracefully
 + cat-file: print tags raw for "cat-file -p"

 A commit object whose author or committer ident are malformed

 Reduce duplicated code between convert.c and attr.c.


* mv/sequencer-pick-error-diag (2013-04-11) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-16 at a2da926)
 + cherry-pick: make sure all input objects are commits

 "git cherry-pick $blob $tree" is diagnosed as a nonsense.


* mv/ssl-ftp-curl (2013-04-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-15 at 7fdada6)
 + Support FTP-over-SSL/TLS for regular FTP

 Does anybody really use commit walkers over ftp???


* nd/checkout-keep-sparse (2013-04-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-19 at 803dabc)
 + checkout: add --ignore-skip-worktree-bits in sparse checkout mode

 Make the initial "sparse" selection of the paths more sticky across
 "git checkout".


* rt/commentchar-fmt-merge-msg (2013-04-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-18 at 96799bd)
 + t6200: avoid path mangling issue on Windows

 A test fix for recent update.

 + read_revisions_from_stdin: make copies for handle_revision_arg

 A fix to a long-standing issue in the command line parser for
 revisions, which was triggered by mv/sequence-pick-error-diag topic.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* jh/checkout-auto-tracking (2013-04-21) 8 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-22 at 2356700)
 + glossary: Update and rephrase the definition of a remote-tracking branch
 + branch.c: Validate tracking branches with refspecs instead of refs/remotes/*
 + t9114.2: Don't use --track option against "svn-remote"-tracking branches
 + t7201.24: Add refspec to keep --track working
 + t3200.39: tracking setup should fail if there is no matching refspec.
 + checkout: Use remote refspecs when DWIMming tracking branches
 + t2024: Show failure to use refspec when DWIMming remote branch names
 + t2024: Add tests verifying current DWIM behavior of 'git checkout <branch>'

 Updates "git checkout foo" that DWIMs the intended "upstream" and
 turns it into "git checkout -t -b foo remotes/origin/foo" to
 correctly take existing remote definitions into account.  The
 remote "origin" may be what uniquely map its own branch to
 remotes/some/where/foo but that some/where may not be "origin".

 Will cook in 'next'.


* mg/more-textconv (2013-04-19) 6 commits
 - grep: honor --textconv for the case rev:path
 - grep: allow to use textconv filters
 - t7008: demonstrate behavior of grep with textconv
 - cat-file: do not die on --textconv without textconv filters
 - show: honor --textconv for blobs
 - t4030: demonstrate behavior of show with textconv

 Will be rerolled.


* jk/receive-pack-deadlocks-with-early-failure (2013-04-19) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-22 at 1e27177)
 + receive-pack: close sideband fd on early pack errors

 When receive-pack detects error in the pack header it received in
 order to decide which of unpack-objects or index-pack to run, it
 returned without closing the error stream, which led to a hang
 sideband thread.

 Will fast-track to 'master'.


* fc/untracked-zsh-prompt (2013-04-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-22 at 472da3e)
 + prompt: fix untracked files for zsh

 Will fast-track to 'master'.


* jn/glossary-revision (2013-04-21) 1 commit
 - glossary: a revision is just a commit

 The wording for "revision" in the glossary wanted to say it refers
 to "commit (noun) as a concept" but it was badly phrased.

 Will cook in 'next'.

 This may need further updates to hint that in contexts where it is
 clear, the word may refer to an object name, not necessarily a
 commit.


* rr/shortlog-doc (2013-04-22) 8 commits
 - builtin/shortlog.c: make usage string consistent with log
 - builtin/log.c: make usage string consistent with doc
 - git-shortlog.txt: make SYNOPSIS match log, update OPTIONS
 - git-log.txt: rewrite note on why "--" may be required
 - git-log.txt: generalize <since>..<until>
 - git-log.txt: order OPTIONS properly; move <since>..<until>
 - revisions.txt: clarify the .. and ... syntax
 - git-shortlog.txt: remove (-h|--help) from OPTIONS

 Update documentation for "log" and "shortlog".

 Looked reasonable.
 Will merge to 'next'.


* mh/multimail (2013-04-21) 1 commit
 - git-multimail: a replacement for post-receive-email

 Waiting for comments.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* jc/format-patch (2013-04-22) 2 commits
 - format-patch: --inline-single
 - format-patch: rename "no_inline" field

 A new option to send a single patch to the standard output to be
 appended at the bottom of a message.  I personally have no need for
 this, but it was easy enough to cobble together.  Tests, docs and
 stripping out more MIMEy stuff are left as exercises to interested
 parties.

 Not ready for inclusion.


* jk/gitweb-utf8 (2013-04-08) 4 commits
 - gitweb: Fix broken blob action parameters on blob/commitdiff pages
 - gitweb: Don't append ';js=(0|1)' to external links
 - gitweb: Make feed title valid utf8
 - gitweb: Fix utf8 encoding for blob_plain, blobdiff_plain, commitdiff_plain, and patch

 Various fixes to gitweb.

 Waiting for a reroll after a review.


* jk/commit-info-slab (2013-04-19) 3 commits
 - commit-slab: introduce a macro to define a slab for new type
 - commit-slab: avoid large realloc
 - commit: allow associating auxiliary info on-demand

 Technology demonstration to show a way we could use unbound number
 of flag bits on commit objects.


* jn/config-ignore-inaccessible (2013-04-15) 1 commit
 - config: allow inaccessible configuration under $HOME

 When $HOME is misconfigured to point at an unreadable directory, we
 used to complain and die. This loosens the check.

 I do not think we agreed that this is a good idea, though.

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* jc/prune-all (2013-04-18) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-22 at b00ccf6)
 + api-parse-options.txt: document "no-" for non-boolean options
 + git-gc.txt, git-reflog.txt: document new expiry options
 + date.c: add parse_expiry_date()

 We used the approxidate() parser for "--expire=<timestamp>" options
 of various commands, but it is better to treat --expire=all and
 --expire=now a bit more specially than using the current timestamp.
 Update "git gc" and "git reflog" with a new parsing function for
 expiry dates.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* nd/pretty-formats (2013-04-18) 13 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-22 at 3d63014)
 + pretty: support %>> that steal trailing spaces
 + pretty: support truncating in %>, %< and %><
 + pretty: support padding placeholders, %< %> and %><
 + pretty: add %C(auto) for auto-coloring
 + pretty: split color parsing into a separate function
 + pretty: two phase conversion for non utf-8 commits
 + utf8.c: add reencode_string_len() that can handle NULs in string
 + utf8.c: add utf8_strnwidth() with the ability to skip ansi sequences
 + utf8.c: move display_mode_esc_sequence_len() for use by other functions
 + pretty: share code between format_decoration and show_decorations
 + pretty-formats.txt: wrap long lines
 + pretty: get the correct encoding for --pretty:format=%e
 + pretty: save commit encoding from logmsg_reencode if the caller needs it

 pretty-printing body of the commit that is stored in non UTF-8
 encoding did not work well.  The early part of this series fixes
 it.  And then it adds %C(auto) specifier that turns the coloring on
 when we are emitting to the terminal, and adds column-aligning
 format directives.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* kb/status-ignored-optim-2 (2013-04-15) 14 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-21 at d2a5c70)
 + dir.c: git-status --ignored: don't scan the work tree twice
 + dir.c: git-status --ignored: don't scan the work tree three times
 + dir.c: git-status: avoid is_excluded checks for tracked files
 + dir.c: replace is_path_excluded with now equivalent is_excluded API
 + dir.c: unify is_excluded and is_path_excluded APIs
 + dir.c: move prep_exclude
 + dir.c: factor out parts of last_exclude_matching for later reuse
 + dir.c: git-clean -d -X: don't delete tracked directories
 + dir.c: make 'git-status --ignored' work within leading directories
 + dir.c: git-status --ignored: don't list empty directories as ignored
 + dir.c: git-ls-files --directories: don't hide empty directories
 + dir.c: git-status --ignored: don't list empty ignored directories
 + dir.c: git-status --ignored: don't list files in ignored directories
 + dir.c: git-status --ignored: don't drop ignored directories

 Rerolls kb/status-ignored-optim topic (reverted from 'next').
 With help from Karsten, conflicts with as/check-ignore topic have
 been sorted out and it is now in 'pu'.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* as/check-ignore (2013-04-11) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-21 at 7515aa8)
 + Documentation: add caveats about I/O buffering for check-{attr,ignore}
 + check-ignore: allow incremental streaming of queries via --stdin
 + check-ignore: move setup into cmd_check_ignore()
 + check-ignore: add -n / --non-matching option
 + t0008: remove duplicated test fixture data

 Enhance "check-ignore" (1.8.2 update) to work more like "check-attr"
 over bidi-pipes.

 Will cook in 'next'.
 The test in the second from the tip needs to be updated.
