What's cooking in git.git (May 2015, #08; Fri, 29)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* jc/diff-ws-error-highlight (2015-05-26) 4 commits
 - diff.c: --ws-error-highlight=<kind> option
 - diff.c: add emit_del_line() and emit_context_line()
 - t4015: separate common setup and per-test expectation
 - t4015: modernise style

 Allow whitespace breakages in deleted and context lines to be also
 painted in the output.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/clone-dissociate (2015-05-27) 2 commits
 - clone: reorder --dissociate and --reference options
 - clone: use OPT_STRING_LIST for --reference

 Code clean-up.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/color-diff-plain-is-context (2015-05-27) 2 commits
 - diff.h: rename DIFF_PLAIN color slot to DIFF_CONTEXT
 - diff: accept color.diff.context as a synonym for "plain"

 "color.diff.plain" was a misnomer; give it 'color.diff.context' as
 a more logical synonym.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/diagnose-config-mmap-failure (2015-05-28) 5 commits
 - xmmap(): drop "Out of memory?"
 - config.c: rewrite ENODEV into EISDIR when mmap fails
 - config.c: avoid xmmap error messages
 - config.c: fix mmap leak when writing config
 - read-cache.c: drop PROT_WRITE from mmap of index

 The configuration reader/writer uses mmap(2) interface to access
 the files; when we find a directory, it barfed with "Out of memory?".

 Will merge to 'next'.


* mh/verify-lock-error-report (2015-05-27) 5 commits
 - ref_transaction_commit(): do not capitalize error messages
 - verify_lock(): do not capitalize error messages
 - verify_lock(): report errors via a strbuf
 - verify_lock(): on errors, let the caller unlock the lock
 - verify_lock(): return 0/-1 rather than struct ref_lock *

 Bring consistency to error reporting mechanism used in "refs" API.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* mt/p4-depotFile-at-version (2015-05-27) 1 commit
 - p4: retrieve the right revision of the file in UTF-16 codepath

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sb/glossary-submodule (2015-05-29) 1 commit
 - glossary: add "remote", "submodule", "superproject"

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sg/config-name-only (2015-05-28) 3 commits
 - completion: use new 'git config' options to reliably list variable names
 - SQUASH
 - config: add options to list only variable names

 "git config --list" output was hard to parse when values consist of
 multiple lines.  Introduce a way to show only the keys.


* sg/merge-summary-config (2015-05-28) 1 commit
 - Documentation: include 'merge.branchdesc' for merge and config as well


* jc/push-tags-also (2015-05-29) 1 commit
 - push --tags: push tags *in addition to* other stuff


* jk/die-on-bogus-worktree-late (2015-05-29) 1 commit
 - setup_git_directory: delay core.bare/core.worktree errors


* jk/make-fix-dependencies (2015-05-29) 3 commits
 - Makefile: silence perl/PM.stamp recipe
 - Makefile: avoid timestamp updates to GIT-BUILD-OPTIONS
 - Makefile: drop dependency between git-instaweb and gitweb

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* kk/log-merges-config (2015-04-21) 5 commits
 - bash-completion: add support for git-log --merges= and log.merges
 - t4202-log: add tests for --merges=
 - Documentation: add git-log --merges= option and log.merges config. var
 - log: honor log.merges= option
 - revision: add --merges={show|only|hide} option

 "git log" (but not other commands in the "log" family) learned to
 pay attention to the log.merges configuration variable that can be
 set to "show" (the normal behaviour), "only" (hide non-merge
 commits), or "hide" (hide merge commits).  --merges=(show|only|hide)
 can be used to override the setting from the command line.

 The documentation may need to be updated once more ($gmane/267250).
 Waiting for a reroll.


* mg/httpd-tests-update-for-apache-2.4 (2015-04-08) 2 commits
 - t/lib-git-svn: check same httpd module dirs as lib-httpd
 - t/lib-httpd: load mod_unixd

 This is the first two commits in a three-patch series $gmane/266962
 Will be rerolled.
 with updated log message ($gmane/268061).


* mh/numparse (2015-03-19) 14 commits
 - diff_opt_parse(): use convert_i() when handling --abbrev=<num>
 - diff_opt_parse(): use convert_i() when handling "-l<num>"
 - opt_arg(): simplify pointer handling
 - opt_arg(): report errors parsing option values
 - opt_arg(): use convert_i() in implementation
 - opt_arg(): val is always non-NULL
 - builtin_diff(): detect errors when parsing --unified argument
 - handle_revision_opt(): use convert_ui() when handling "--abbrev="
 - strtoul_ui(), strtol_i(): remove functions
 - handle_revision_opt(): use convert_i() when handling "-<digit>"
 - handle_revision_opt(): use skip_prefix() in many places
 - write_subdirectory(): use convert_ui() for parsing mode
 - cacheinfo_callback(): use convert_ui() when handling "--cacheinfo"
 - numparse: new module for parsing integral numbers

 Many codepaths use unchecked use of strtol() and friends (or even
 worse, atoi()).  Introduce a set of wrappers that try to be more
 careful.

 Will be rerolled.
 ($gmane/268058).


* tf/gitweb-project-listing (2015-03-19) 5 commits
 - gitweb: make category headings into links when they are directories
 - gitweb: optionally set project category from its pathname
 - gitweb: add a link under the search box to clear a project filter
 - gitweb: if the PATH_INFO is incomplete, use it as a project_filter
 - gitweb: fix typo in man page

 Update gitweb to make it more pleasant to deal with a hierarchical
 forest of repositories.

 Any comments from those who use or have their own code in Gitweb?


* jc/a-lone-dash-stands-for-previous-branch (2015-03-16) 1 commit
 - "-" and "@{-1}" on various programs

 Lose special case code to make a lone dash "-" mean the previous
 branch aka "@{-1}" from a handful subcommands, and instead support
 the notation throughout the system by reimplementing it at the
 revisions layer.

 Needs tests, documentation updates, etc.  Also does only a half-way
 job dealing with range notation, which needs to be fixed before the
 series goes anywhere.


* nd/list-files (2015-02-09) 21 commits
 - t3080: tests for git-list-files
 - list-files: -M aka diff-cached
 - list-files -F: show submodules with the new indicator '&'
 - list-files: add -F/--classify
 - list-files: show directories as well as files
 - list-files: do not show duplicate cached entries
 - list-files: sort output and remove duplicates
 - list-files: add -t back
 - list-files: add -1 short for --no-column
 - list-files: add -R/--recursive short for --max-depth=-1
 - list-files: -u does not imply showing stages
 - list-files: make alias 'ls' default to 'list-files'
 - list-files: a user friendly version of ls-files and more
 - ls-files: support --max-depth
 - ls-files: add --column
 - ls-files: add --color to highlight file names

 - ls_colors.c: parse color.ls.* from config file
 - ls_colors.c: add $LS_COLORS parsing code

 A new "git list-files" Porcelain command, "ls-files" with bells and
 whistles.

 Reroll to base on wt-status work ($gmane/265142) has seen some
 positive discussions.

 Waiting for a further polished reroll ($gmane/265534).

 - fsck: offer a function to demote fsck errors to warnings
 - fsck: provide a function to parse fsck message IDs
 - fsck: introduce identifiers for fsck messages
 - fsck: introduce fsck options

 "fsck.warnings = <list of error tokens>" I suggested turned out to
 be an unpopular choice (sorry Dscho).

 Expecting a reroll.


* nd/pathspec-strip-fix (2015-04-18) 1 commit
 - pathspec: adjust prefixlen after striping trailing slash

 Does not quite fix ($gmane/267614).
 Will discard.


* jc/diff-b-m (2015-02-23) 5 commits
 . WIPWIP
 . WIP: diff-b-m
 - diffcore-rename: allow easier debugging
 - diffcore-rename.c: add locate_rename_src()
 - diffcore-break: allow debugging

 "git diff -B -M" produced incorrect patch when the postimage of a
 completely rewritten file is similar to the preimage of a removed
 file; such a resulting file must not be expressed as a rename from
 other place.

 The fix in this patch is broken, unfortunately.


* pw/remote-set-url-fetch (2014-11-26) 1 commit
 - remote: add --fetch and --both options to set-url

 Expecting a reroll.


* tr/remerge-diff (2014-11-10) 9 commits

 - merge-recursive: internal flag to avoid touching the worktree
 - merge-recursive: remove dead conditional in update_stages()

 "log -p" output learns a new way to let users inspect a merge
 commit by showing the differences between the automerged result
 with conflicts the person who recorded the merge would have seen
 and the final conflict resolution that was recorded in the merge.

 Waiting for a reroll ($gmane/256591).


* hv/submodule-config (2014-11-11) 4 commits
 - do not die on error of parsing fetchrecursesubmodules option
 - use new config API for worktree configurations of submodules
 - extract functions for submodule config set and lookup
 - implement submodule config cache for lookup of submodule names

 Kicked back to 'pu' per request ($gmane/255610).


* tg/perf-lib-test-perf-cleanup (2013-09-19) 2 commits
 - perf-lib: add test_perf_cleanup target
 - perf-lib: split starting the test from the execution

 Add test_perf_cleanup shell function to the perf suite, that allows
 the script writers to define a test with a clean-up action.

 Will hold.


* jc/show-branch (2014-03-24) 5 commits
 - show-branch: use commit slab to represent bitflags of arbitrary width
 - show-branch.c: remove "all_mask"

 "git mergetool" learned to drive WinMerge as a backend.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/http-backend-deadlock-2.2 (2015-05-25) 3 commits
 + http-backend: spool ref negotiation requests to buffer
 + t5551: factor out tag creation
 + http-backend: fix die recursion with custom handler
 (this branch is used by jk/http-backend-deadlock and jk/http-backend-deadlock-2.3.)

 Communication between the HTTP server and http_backend process can
 lead to a dead-lock when relaying a large ref negotiation request.
 Diagnose the situation better, and mitigate it by reading such a
 request first into core (to a reasonable limit).

 This was wiggled back to apply to the 2.2 maintenance track
 (original was for 2.4).

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/http-backend-deadlock-2.3 (2015-05-25) 1 commit
 + Merge branch 'jk/http-backend-deadlock-2.2' into jk/http-backend-deadlock-2.3
 (this branch is used by jk/http-backend-deadlock; uses jk/http-backend-deadlock-2.2.)

 Same for 2.3 maintenance track.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/stash-options (2015-05-20) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-05-26 at 5dcb026)

 Will merge to 'master'.


* rs/janitorial (2015-05-20) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-05-26 at 9d5aee4)

 + use file_exists() to check if a file exists in the worktree

 Will merge to 'master'.


* fm/fetch-raw-sha1 (2015-05-22) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-05-26 at dc3f1b3)
 + upload-pack: optionally allow fetching reachable sha1
 + upload-pack: prepare to extend allow-tip-sha1-in-want
 + config.txt: clarify allowTipSHA1InWant with camelCase

 "git upload-pack" that serves "git fetch" can be told to serve
 commits that are not at the tip of any ref as long as they are
 reachable from a ref with uploadpack.allowReachableSHA1InWant
 configuration variable.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/commit-slab (2015-05-22) 1 commit
 - commit-slab: introduce slabname##_peek() function

 Memory use reduction when commit-slab facility is used to annotate
 sparsely (which is not recommended in the first place).


* mm/rebase-i-post-rewrite-exec (2015-05-22) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-05-26 at 8ddaab1)
 + t5407: use <<- to align the expected output
 + rebase -i: fix post-rewrite hook with failed exec command
 + rebase -i: demonstrate incorrect behavior of post-rewrite

 "git rebase -i" fired post-rewrite hook when it shouldn't (namely,
 when it was told to stop sequencing with 'exec' insn).

 Will merge to 'master'.


* sb/submodule-doc-intro (2015-05-28) 1 commit
 - submodule doc: reorder introductory paragraphs

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sb/test-bitmap-free-at-end (2015-05-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-05-26 at 1014ebf)
 + test_bitmap_walk: free bitmap with bitmap_free

 Will merge to 'master'.


* dt/cat-file-follow-symlinks (2015-05-20) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-05-26 at 7ae52d4)
 + cat-file: add --follow-symlinks to --batch
 + sha1_name: get_sha1_with_context learns to follow symlinks
 + tree-walk: learn get_tree_entry_follow_symlinks

 "git cat-file --batch(-check)" learned the "--follow-symlinks"
 option that follows an in-tree symbolic links when asked about an
 object via extended SHA-1 syntax, e.g. HEAD:RelNotes that points at
 Documentation/RelNotes/2.5.0.txt.  With the new option, the command
 behaves as if HEAD:Documentation/RelNotes/2.5.0.txt was given as
 input instead.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* dt/clean-pathspec-filter-then-lstat (2015-05-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-05-26 at 9b24d71)
 + clean: only lstat files in pathspec

 "git clean pathspec..." tried to lstat(2) and complain even for
 paths outside the given pathspec.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jh/filter-empty-contents (2015-05-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-05-26 at 9cad398)
 + sha1_file: pass empty buffer to index empty file

 The clean/smudge interface did not work well when filtering an
 empty contents (failed and then passed the empty input through).
 It can be argued that a filter that produces anything but empty for
 an empty input is nonsense, but if the user wants to do strange
 things, then why not?

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/http-backend-deadlock (2015-05-25) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-05-26 at 9f3bd8a)
 + Merge branch 'jk/http-backend-deadlock-2.3' into jk/http-backend-deadlock
 (this branch uses jk/http-backend-deadlock-2.2 and jk/http-backend-deadlock-2.3.)

 Communication between the HTTP server and http_backend process can
 lead to a dead-lock when relaying a large ref negotiation request.
 Diagnose the situation better, and mitigate it by reading such a
 request first into core (to a reasonable limit).

 Will merge to 'master'.


* mm/log-format-raw-doc (2015-05-20) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-05-26 at 97e2c9d)
 + Documentation/log: clarify sha1 non-abbreviation in log --raw
 + Documentation/log: clarify what --raw means

 Clarify that "log --raw" and "log --format=raw" are unrelated
 concepts.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* sg/help-group (2015-05-21) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-05-26 at 2749912)
 + help: respect new common command grouping

 elements to help early learners.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ld/p4-editor-multi-words (2015-05-26) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-05-28 at a368a47)
 + git-p4: tests: use test-chmtime in place of touch
 + git-p4: fix handling of multi-word P4EDITOR
 + git-p4: add failing test for P4EDITOR handling

 Unlike "$EDITOR" and "$GIT_EDITOR" that can hold the path to the
 command and initial options (e.g. "/path/to/emacs -nw"), 'git p4'
 did not let the shell interpolate the contents of the environment
 variable that name the editor "$P4EDITOR" (and "$EDITOR", too).
 Make it in line with the rest of Git, as well as with Perforce.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* pt/pull-tests (2015-05-29) 8 commits
 - t5520: check reflog action in fast-forward merge

 - t5520: test work tree fast-forward when fetch updates head
 - t5520: test for failure if index has unresolved entries
 - t5520: test no merge candidates cases
 - t5520: prevent field splitting in content comparisons

 Add more test coverage to "git pull".

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jc/clone-bundle (2015-04-30) 1 commit
 - repack: optionally create a clone.bundle

 Still an early WIP


* jk/at-push-sha1 (2015-05-22) 16 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-05-26 at d9d342f)

 + remote.c: provide per-branch pushremote name
 + remote.c: hoist branch.*.remote lookup out of remote_get_1
 + remote.c: drop "remote" pointer from "struct branch"
 + remote.c: refactor setup of branch->merge list
 + remote.c: drop default_remote_name variable

 Introduce <branch>@{push} short-hand to denote the remote-tracking
 branch that tracks the branch at the remote the <branch> would be
 pushed to.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 - clean: improve performance when removing lots of directories
 - p7300: add performance tests for clean
 - t7300: add tests to document behavior of clean and nested git
 - setup: sanity check file size in read_gitfile_gently
 - setup: add gentle version of read_gitfile

 Replace "is this subdirectory a separate repository that should not
 be touched?" check "git clean" does by checking if it has .git/HEAD
 using the submodule-related code with a more optimized check.

 Waiting for a reroll.


* jc/merge-drop-old-syntax (2015-04-29) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-05-28 at 6bfd8b9)
 + merge: drop 'git merge <message> HEAD <commit>' syntax

 Stop supporting "git merge <message> HEAD <commit>" syntax that
 has been deprecated since October 2007.

 Will keep in 'next' during the 2.5 cycle.


* ah/usage-strings (2015-05-03) 1 commit
