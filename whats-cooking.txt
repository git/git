What's cooking in git.git (Sep 2020, #08; Tue, 29)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'seen' (formerly 'pu'---proposed updates) while commits prefixed
with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches of the
repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

* ah/pull (2020-09-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-25 at b5ddf0cf8b)
 + pull: don't warn if pull.ff has been set

 Earlier we taught "git pull" to warn when the user does not say the
 histories need to be merged, rebased or accepts only fast-
 forwarding, but the warning triggered for those who have set the
 pull.ff configuration variable.


* bc/clone-with-git-default-hash-fix (2020-09-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-22 at 62ea45c20e)
 + builtin/clone: avoid failure with GIT_DEFAULT_HASH

 "git clone" that clones from SHA-1 repository, while
 GIT_DEFAULT_HASH set to use SHA-256 already, resulted in an
 unusable repository that half-claims to be SHA-256 repository
 with SHA-1 objects and refs.  This has been corrected.


* bc/faq-misc (2020-09-20) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-22 at a81b728010)
 + docs: explain how to deal with files that are always modified

  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-25 at 21a5f9e880)
 + protocol: re-enable v2 protocol by default

 The transport protocol v2 has become the default again.


* tb/bloom-improvements (2020-09-18) 13 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-22 at 520d531ad8)
 + commit-graph: introduce 'commitGraph.maxNewFilters'

 + t4216: use an '&&'-chain
 + commit-graph: introduce 'get_bloom_filter_settings()'

 "git commit-graph write" learned to limit the number of bloom
 filters that are computed from scratch with the --max-new-filters
 option.

  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-25 at c2078e5505)
 + diff: fix modified lines stats with --stat and --numstat

 "git range-diff" showed incorrect diffstat, which has been
 corrected.

 Docfix.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/format-auto-base-when-able (2020-09-26) 1 commit
 - format-patch: teach format.useAutoBase "whenAble" option

 "git format-patch" learns to take "if-able" as a possible value for
 its "--base" option, and "whenAble" as a possible value for the
 format.useAutoBase configuration variable to become no-op when the
 automatically computed base does not make sense.

 The first step to remove on-disk binaries for built-in subcommands
 by soliciting objections.

 On hold for now.


* dr/push-remoteref-fix (2020-04-23) 1 commit
 - remote.c: fix handling of %(push:remoteref)

 The "%(push:remoteref)" placeholder in the "--format=" argument of
 "git format-patch" (and friends) only showed what got explicitly
 configured, not what ref at the receiving end would be updated when
 "git push" was used, as it ignored the default behaviour (e.g. update
 the same ref as the source).

 Discard for now.
 cf. <xmqqv9gu7c61.fsf@gitster.c.googlers.com>
 cf. <20200911214358.acl3hy2e763begoo@feanor>


* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2018-10-15) 1 commit
 - zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

 "git bisect start X Y", when X and Y are not valid committish
 object names, should take X and Y as pathspec, but didn't.

 + Revert "fast-export: use local array to store anonymized oid"

 Compilation fix around type punning.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/blame-ignore-fix (2020-09-24) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-29 at 96fbdb57fb)
 + blame: validate and peel the object names on the ignore list
 + t8013: minimum preparatory clean-up

 "git blame --ignore-rev/--ignore-revs-file" failed to validate
 their input are valid revision, and failed to take into account
 that the user may want to give an annotated tag instead of a
 commit, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/shortlog-group-by-trailer (2020-09-27) 8 commits

 - cmake: ignore files generated by CMake as run in Visual Studio

 Using the CMake support we added some time ago for real with Visual
 Studio build revealed there were lot of usability improvements
 possible, which have been carried out.

 Expecting a (hopefully) final reroll.

  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-29 at 9af3360572)

 - Makefile: use git-archive --add-file
 - archive: add --add-file
 - archive: read short blobs in archive.c::write_archive_entry()

 "git archive" learns the "--add-file" option to include untracked
 files into a snapshot from a tree-ish.

 - t9902: avoid using the branch name `master`

* jt/keep-partial-clone-filter-upon-lazy-fetch (2020-09-28) 2 commits
 - fetch: do not override partial clone filter
 - promisor-remote: remove unused variable

 The lazy fetching done internally to make missing objects available
 in a partial clone incorrectly made permanent damate to the partial
 clone filter in the repository, which has been corrected.


* dl/diff-merge-base (2020-09-21) 10 commits
 - contrib/completion: complete `git diff --merge-base`
 - builtin/diff-tree: learn --merge-base
 - builtin/diff-index: learn --merge-base
 - t4068: add --merge-base tests
 - diff-lib: define diff_get_merge_base()
 - diff-lib: accept option flags in run_diff_index()
 - contrib/completion: extract common diff/difftool options
 - git-diff.txt: backtick quote command text
 - git-diff-index.txt: make --cached description a proper sentence
 - t4068: remove unnecessary >tmp

 "git diff A...B" learned "git diff --merge-base A B", which is a
 longer short-hand to say the same thing.

 Expecting a reroll.
 cf. <xmqqblhyepup.fsf@gitster.c.googlers.com>


* sb/clone-origin (2020-09-29) 7 commits
 - clone: allow configurable default for `-o`/`--origin`
 - clone: read new remote name from remote_name instead of option_origin
 - clone: validate --origin option before use
 - refs: consolidate remote name validation
 - remote: add tests for add and rename with invalid names

 "git clone" learned clone.defaultremotename configuration variable
 to customize what nickname to use to call the remote the repository
 was cloned from.

 Expecting an update.


* sk/force-if-includes (2020-09-27) 4 commits
 - SQUASH??? name an array in singular and avoid commenting obvious
 - t, doc: update tests, reference for "--force-if-includes"
 - push: parse and set flag for "--force-if-includes"
 - push: add reflog check for "--force-if-includes"

 "git push --force-with-lease[=<ref>]" can easily be misused to lose
 commits unless the user takes good care of their own "git fetch".
 A new option "--force-if-includes" attempts to ensure that what is
 being force-pushed was created after examining the commit at the
 tip of the remote ref that is about to be force-replaced.

 On hold.
 Seems to trigger gotchas in the reachability logic in commit-graph.


* ab/mediawiki-fixes (2020-09-21) 18 commits

 Allow the configuration to specify no abbreviation regardless of
 the hash algorithm.

 Expecting a reroll.  The intent is very good.


* mr/bisect-in-c-2 (2020-09-24) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-29 at a15f1729d2)
 + bisect--helper: reimplement `bisect_next` and `bisect_auto_next` shell functions in C

 Rewrite of the "git bisect" script in C continues.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* js/no-builtins-on-disk-option (2020-09-21) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-25 at 6b976da4d2)
 + ci: stop linking built-ins to the dashed versions
 + Optionally skip linking/copying the built-ins
 + msvc: copy the correct `.pdb` files in the Makefile target `install`

 The installation procedure learned to optionally omit "git-foo"
 executable files for each 'foo' built-in subcommand, which are only
 required by old timers that still rely on the age old promise that
 prepending "git --exec-path" output to PATH early in their script
 will keep the "git-foo" calls they wrote working.

 The old attempt to remove these executables from the disk failed in
 the 1.6 era; it may be worth attempting again, but I think it is
 worth to keep this topic separate from such a policy change to help
 it graduate early.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/refspecs-negative (2020-09-25) 1 commit

* js/ignore-cmake-build-artifacts (2020-09-23) 1 commit
 . cmake: ignore generated files

 Running CMake based build with VS (in contrib/) from the top-level
