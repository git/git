What's cooking in git.git (Oct 2015, #03; Wed, 14)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.

With somewhat reduced review bandwidth, I'd expect that the upcoming
cycle would be slower than usual.  At tinyurl.com/gitCal, I
tentatively drew a 14-week schedule for this cycle (I plan to be
offline during weeks #7-#9 myself---hopefully we'll have capable
interim maintainers to take care of the list traffic in the meantime
as in past years).

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

 + Documentation: fix section header mark-up


* jk/notes-dwim-doc (2015-09-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-10-07 at c4341d1)
 + notes: correct documentation of DWIMery for notes references
 (this branch is used by mh/notes-allow-reading-treeish.)

 The way how --ref/--notes to specify the notes tree reference are
 DWIMmed was not clearly documented.


* nd/ls-remote-does-not-have-u-option (2015-09-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-10-07 at 0790a76)

* jc/mailinfo (2015-10-08) 1 commit
 . mailinfo: ignore in-body header that we do not care about

 Some people write arbitrary garbage at the beginning of a piece of
 e-mail (or after -- >8 -- scissors -- >8 -- line) in the commit log
 message and expect them to be discarded, even though "From:" and
 "Subject:" are the only documented in-body headers that you are
 supposed to have there.  Allow some garbage (specifically, what may
 look like RFC2822 headers like "MIME-Version: ...") to be there and
 ignore them.

 I have a feeling that that this is a step in a wrong direction.
 Excluded from 'pu' for now.


* jk/filter-branch-use-of-sed-on-incomplete-line (2015-10-12) 1 commit
 - filter-branch: remove multi-line headers in msg filter

 A recent "filter-branch --msg-filter" broke skipping of the commit
 object header, which is fixed.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* rd/test-path-utils (2015-10-08) 1 commit
 - test-path-utils.c: remove incorrect assumption

 The normalize_ceiling_entry() function does not muck with the end
 of the path it accepts, and the real world callers do rely on that,
 but a test insisted that the function drops a trailing slash.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jc/doc-gc-prune-now (2015-10-14) 1 commit
 - Documentation/gc: warn against --prune=<now>

 "git gc" is safe to run anytime only because it has the built-in
 grace period to protect young objects.  In order to run with no
 grace period, the user must make sure that the repository is
 quiescent.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jc/am-mailinfo-direct (2015-10-14) 1 commit
 - am: make direct call to mailinfo
 (this branch uses jc/mailinfo-lib.)

 "git am" used to spawn "git mailinfo" via run_command() API once
 per each patch, but learned to make a direct call to mailinfo()
 instead.

 Needs benchmark on platforms with slow run_command().


* jc/mailinfo-lib (2015-10-14) 30 commits
 - mailinfo: remove calls to exit() and die() deep in the callchain
 - mailinfo: handle charset conversion errors in the caller
 - mailinfo: libify
 - mailinfo: move definition of MAX_HDR_PARSED to closer to its use
 - mailinfo: move cleanup_space() before its users
 - mailinfo: move check_header() after the helpers it uses
 - mailinfo: move read_one_header_line() closer to its callers
 - mailinfo: move content/content_top to struct mailinfo
 - mailinfo: keep the parsed log message in a strbuf
 - mailinfo: move [ps]_hdr_data to struct mailinfo
 - mailinfo: move cmitmsg and patchfile to struct mailinfo
 - mailinfo: handle_commit_msg() shouldn't be called after finding patchbreak
 - mailinfo: move charset to struct mailinfo
 - mailinfo: move transfer_encoding to struct mailinfo
 - mailinfo: move metainfo_charset to struct mailinfo
 - mailinfo: move use_scissors and use_inbody_headers to struct mailinfo
 - mailinfo: move add_message_id and message_id to struct mailinfo

 - mailinfo: move global "FILE *fin, *fout" to struct mailinfo
 - mailinfo: move keep_subject & keep_non_patch_bracket to struct mailinfo
 - mailinfo: introduce "struct mailinfo" to hold globals
 - mailinfo: move global "line" into mailinfo() function
 - mailinfo: always pass "line" as an argument
 - mailinfo: get rid of function-local static states
 - mailinfo: move handle_boundary() lower
 - mailinfo: fold decode_header_bq() into decode_header()
 - mailinfo: explicitly close file handle to the patch output
 - mailinfo: fix for off-by-one error in boundary stack
 - mailinfo: remove a no-op call convert_to_utf8(it, "")
 (this branch is used by jc/am-mailinfo-direct.)

 The implementation of "git mailinfo" was refactored so that a
 mailinfo() function can be directly called from inside a process.


* jc/am-3-fallback-regression-fix (2015-10-09) 1 commit
 - am -3: do not let failed merge from completing the error codepath
 (this branch is used by js/am-3-merge-recursive-direct.)

 "git am -3" had a small regression where it is aborted in its error
 handling codepath when underlying merge-recursive failed in certain
 ways, as it assumed that the internal call to merge-recursive will
 never die, which is not the case (yet).


* js/am-3-merge-recursive-direct (2015-10-12) 2 commits
 - am: make a direct call to merge_recursive
 - merge_recursive_options: introduce the "gently" flag
 (this branch uses jc/am-3-fallback-regression-fix.)

 The merge_recursive_generic() function has been made a bit safer to
 call from inside a process.  "git am -3" was taught to make a direct
 call to the function when falling back to three-way merge.


* km/cache-entry-refcnt (2015-10-12) 1 commit
 - merge: fix cache_entry use-after-free

 Sometimes we discarded a cache-entry that is still referenced from
 name-hash (used only to hold the pathname there), leading to use
 after free errors.  Reference-count cache entries to work it
 around.


* ls/p4-test-updates (2015-10-12) 2 commits
 - git-p4: skip t9819 test case on case insensitive file systems
 - git-p4: avoid "stat" command in t9815 git-p4-submit-fail

 A few test scripts around "git p4" have been improved for
 portability.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sb/submodule-config-parse (2015-10-12) 1 commit
 - submodule-config: "goto" removal in parse_config()

 Will merge to 'next'.


* tb/t0027-crlf (2015-10-12) 1 commit
 - t0027: improve test for not-normalized files

 The test for various line-ending conversions has been enhanced.

* dk/gc-idx-wo-pack (2015-08-17) 3 commits
 - DONTMERGE: log message, grace-period and tests $gmane/276058
 - gc: remove stale .idx files without corresponding .pack file
 - prepare_packed_git(): refactor garbage reporting in pack directory

 Having a leftover .idx file without correspoinding .pack file in
 the repository hurts performance; "git gc" learned to prune them.

 Waiting for a reroll.


* nd/ita-cleanup (2015-09-06) 6 commits
 - grep: make it clear i-t-a entries are ignored
 - checkout(-index): do not checkout i-t-a entries
 - apply: make sure check_preimage() does not leave empty file on error
 - apply: fix adding new files on i-t-a entries
 - add and use a convenience macro ce_intent_to_add()
 - blame: remove obsolete comment

 Paths that have been told the index about with "add -N" are not yet
 in the index, but various commands behaved as if they already are.

 Some commits need better explanation.

 Waiting for a reroll.


* ld/p4-detached-head (2015-09-09) 2 commits
 - git-p4: work with a detached head
 - git-p4: add failing test for submit from detached head

 Will be rerolled.

 - worktree: add details to the worktree struct
 - worktree: add a function to get worktree details
 - worktree: refactor find_linked_symref function
 - worktree: add top-level worktree.c

 Add the "list" subcommand to "git worktree".


* mg/httpd-tests-update-for-apache-2.4 (2015-04-08) 2 commits
 - t/lib-git-svn: check same httpd module dirs as lib-httpd
 - t/lib-httpd: load mod_unixd

 This is the first two commits in a three-patch series $gmane/266962

 Becoming tired of waiting for a reroll.
 with updated log message ($gmane/268061).


* wp/sha1-name-negative-match (2015-06-08) 2 commits
 - sha1_name.c: introduce '^{/!-<negative pattern>}' notation
 - test for '!' handling in rev-parse's named commits

 Introduce "branch^{/!-<pattern>}" notation to name a commit
 reachable from branch that does not match the given pattern.

 Becoming tired of waiting for a reroll.
 ($gmane/271213).


* ak/format-patch-odir-config (2015-06-19) 1 commit
 - format-patch: introduce format.outputDirectory configuration

 Reroll exists but didn't pick it up as it seemed to be still
 collecting review comments.

 Becoming tired of waiting for a reroll.
 ($gmane/272180).


* mh/notes-allow-reading-treeish (2015-10-08) 3 commits
 - notes: allow treeish expressions as notes ref
 + Merge branch 'jk/notes-dwim-doc' into next
 + Merge branch 'jc/merge-drop-old-syntax' into next
 (this branch uses jc/merge-drop-old-syntax.)

 Some "git notes" operations, e.g. "git log --notes=<note>", should
 be able to read notes from any tree-ish that is shaped like a notes
 tree, but the notes infrastructure required that the argument must
 be a ref under refs/notes/.  Loosen it to require a valid ref only
 when the operation would update the notes (in which case we must
 have a place to store the updated notes tree, iow, a ref).


* jc/diff-b-m (2015-02-23) 5 commits
 . WIPWIP
 . WIP: diff-b-m
 - diffcore-rename: allow easier debugging
 - diffcore-rename.c: add locate_rename_src()
 - diffcore-break: allow debugging

 "git diff -B -M" produced incorrect patch when the postimage of a
 completely rewritten file is similar to the preimage of a removed
 file; such a resulting file must not be expressed as a rename from
 other place.

 The fix in this patch is broken, unfortunately.

* gr/rebase-i-drop-warn (2015-10-05) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-10-09 at 0626b96)
 + rebase-i: loosen over-eager check_bad_cmd check
 + rebase-i: explicitly accept tab as separator in commands

 "git rebase -i" had a minor regression recently, which stopped
 considering a line that begins with an indented '#' in its insn

 + sha1_file.c: add a function to release all packs
 + sha1_file: consolidate code to close a pack's file descriptor
 + t5700: demonstrate a Windows file locking issue with `git clone --dissociate`

 "git clone --dissociate" runs a big "git repack" process at the

 + pack-objects: do not get distracted by broken symrefs
 + gc: demonstrate failure with stale remote HEAD

 --auto" is run.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/graph-format-padding (2015-09-14) 1 commit
 - pretty: pass graph width to pretty formatting for use in '%>|(N)'

 Redefine the way '%>|(N)' padding and the "--graph" option
 interacts.  It has been that the available columns to display the
 log message was measured from the edge of the area the graph ended,
 but with this it becomes the beginning of the entire output.

 I have a suspicion that 50% of the users would appreciate this
 change, and the remainder see this break their expectation.  If
 that is the case, we might need to introduce a similar but
 different alignment operator so that this new behaviour is
 available to those who want to use it, without negatively affecting
 existing uses.

 Undecided.

* sb/submodule-parallel-fetch (2015-10-12) 8 commits
 - submodules: allow parallel fetching, add tests and documentation
 - fetch_populated_submodules: use new parallel job processing
 - run-command: add an asynchronous parallel child processor
 - sigchain: add command to pop all common signals
 - strbuf: add strbuf_read_once to read without blocking
 - xread_nonblock: add functionality to read from fds without blocking
 - xread: poll on non blocking fds

 Add a framework to spawn a group of processes in parallel, and use
 it to run "git fetch --recurse-submodules" in parallel.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* mk/submodule-gitdir-path (2015-09-14) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-10-09 at cf8768e)
 + path: implement common_dir handling in git_pathdup_submodule()
 + submodule refactor: use strbuf_git_path_submodule() in add_submodule_odb()

 The submodule code has been taught to work better with separate
 work trees created via "git worktree add".

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ls/p4-lfs (2015-10-03) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-10-14 at 4b8c365)
 + git-p4: add Git LFS backend for large file system
 + git-p4: add support for large file systems
 + git-p4: check free space during streaming
 + git-p4: add file streaming progress in verbose mode
 + git-p4: return an empty list if a list config has no values
 + git-p4: add gitConfigInt reader
 + git-p4: add optional type specifier to gitConfig reader

 Teach "git p4" to send large blobs outside the repository by
 talking to Git LFS.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* nd/clone-linked-checkout (2015-09-28) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-10-09 at a93973f)
 + clone: better error when --reference is a linked checkout
 + clone: allow --local from a linked checkout
 + enter_repo: allow .git files in strict mode
 + enter_repo: avoid duplicating logic, use is_git_directory() instead
 + t0002: add test for enter_repo(), non-strict mode
 + path.c: delete an extra space

 It was not possible to use a repository-lookalike created by "git
 worktree add" as a local source of "git clone".

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ad/cygwin-wants-rename (2015-08-07) 1 commit
 - config.mak.uname: Cygwin needs OBJECT_CREATION_USES_RENAMES

 Will hold.

* jc/rerere-multi (2015-09-14) 7 commits
 - rerere: do use multiple variants
 - t4200: rerere a merge with two identical conflicts
 - rerere: allow multiple variants to exist
 - rerere: delay the recording of preimage
 - rerere: handle leftover rr-cache/$ID directory and postimage files
 - rerere: scan $GIT_DIR/rr-cache/$ID when instantiating a rerere_id
 - rerere: split conflict ID further

 "git rerere" can encounter two or more files with the same conflict
 signature that have to be resolved in different ways, but there was
 no way to record these separate resolutions.


* jc/merge-drop-old-syntax (2015-04-29) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-10-07 at 50fed71)
 + merge: drop 'git merge <message> HEAD <commit>' syntax
 (this branch is used by mh/notes-allow-reading-treeish.)

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2015-05-28

 Stop supporting "git merge <message> HEAD <commit>" syntax that
 has been deprecated since October 2007.

 Will keep in 'next' during the 2.7 cycle.

 A new "git list-files" Porcelain command, "ls-files" with bells and
 whistles.

 Reroll to base on wt-status work ($gmane/265142) has seen some
 positive discussions.

* mh/numparse (2015-03-19) 14 commits
 . diff_opt_parse(): use convert_i() when handling --abbrev=<num>
 . diff_opt_parse(): use convert_i() when handling "-l<num>"
 . opt_arg(): simplify pointer handling
 . opt_arg(): report errors parsing option values
 . opt_arg(): use convert_i() in implementation
 . opt_arg(): val is always non-NULL
 . builtin_diff(): detect errors when parsing --unified argument

 Many codepaths use unchecked use of strtol() and friends (or even
 worse, atoi()).  Introduce a set of wrappers that try to be more
 careful.

* kk/log-merges-config (2015-04-21) 5 commits
 . bash-completion: add support for git-log --merges= and log.merges
 . t4202-log: add tests for --merges=
 . Documentation: add git-log --merges= option and log.merges config. var
 . log: honor log.merges= option
 . revision: add --merges={show|only|hide} option

 "git log" (but not other commands in the "log" family) learned to
 pay attention to the log.merges configuration variable that can be
 set to "show" (the normal behaviour), "only" (hide non-merge
 commits), or "hide" (hide merge commits).  --merges=(show|only|hide)
 can be used to override the setting from the command line.

 The documentation may need to be updated once more ($gmane/267250).

* mk/utf8-no-iconv-warn (2015-06-08) 1 commit
 . utf8.c: print warning about disabled iconv

 Warn when a reencoding is requested in a build without iconv
 support, as the end user is likely to get an unexpected result.  I
 think the same level of safety should be added to a build with
 iconv support when the specified encoding is not available, but the
 patch does not go there.

 . name-hash: allow dir hashing even when !ignore_case
 . merge-recursive: allow storing conflict hunks in index
 . merge_diff_mode: fold all merge diff variants into an enum
 . combine-diff: do not pass revs->dense_combined_merges redundantly
 . merge-recursive: -Xindex-only to leave worktree unchanged
 . merge-recursive: internal flag to avoid touching the worktree
 . merge-recursive: remove dead conditional in update_stages()

 "log -p" output learns a new way to let users inspect a merge
 commit by showing the differences between the automerged result
 with conflicts the person who recorded the merge would have seen
 and the final conflict resolution that was recorded in the merge.

 Waiting for a reroll.

* tg/perf-lib-test-perf-cleanup (2013-09-19) 2 commits
 . perf-lib: add test_perf_cleanup target

 Add test_perf_cleanup shell function to the perf suite, that allows
 the script writers to define a test with a clean-up action.
