What's cooking in git.git (Jan 2026, #08)
-----------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and
aren't considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL
to a message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity (of course they can be resubmit when new interests
arise).

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

Git 2.53-rc1 has been tagged.  What's slated to 'master' as of this
edition of the "What's cooking" report will be merged and would
appear in the upcoming release, while everything else will have to
wait until the next cycle begins.  Until then, please hunt for
regressions.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/

	https://gitlab.com/git-scm/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

 Dscho observed that SVN tests are taking too much time in CI leak
 checking tasks, but most time is spent not in our code but in libsvn
 code (which happen to be written in Perl), whose leaks have little
 value to discover for us.  Skip SVN, P4, and CVS tests in the leak
 checking tasks.

 has been corrected.

 "git add ':(exclude)foo.o'" is clearly a request not to add 'foo.o',
 but the command complained about listing an ignored path foo.o on
 the command line, which has been corrected.

 Introduce a more robust way to parse a decimal integer stored in a
 piece of memory that is not necessarily terminated with NUL (which
 Asan strict-string-check complains even when use of strtol() is
 safe due to varified existence of whitespace after the digits).
