What's cooking in git.git (Feb 2020, #01; Wed, 5)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

  (merged to 'next' on 2020-01-22 at 4d94d5800f)
 + graph: fix collapse of multiple edges
 + graph: add test to demonstrate horizontal line bug

 Rendering by "git log --graph" of ancestry lines leading to a merge
 commit were made suboptimal to waste vertical space a bit with a
 recent update, which has been corrected.


* ds/refmap-doc (2020-01-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-01-22 at 51d81a499b)
 + fetch: document and test --refmap=""

 "git fetch --refmap=" option has got a better documentation.


* ds/sparse-cone (2020-01-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-01-22 at bfca10dcd7)
 + unpack-trees: correctly compute result count

 The code recently added in this release to move to the entry beyond
 the ones in the same directory in the index in the sparse-cone mode
 did not count the number of entries to skip over incorrectly, which
 has been corrected.

  (merged to 'next' on 2020-01-15 at 832ecf4366)
 + unpack-trees: watch for out-of-range index position

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2020-01-09

 The code that tries to skip over the entries for the paths in a
 single directory using the cache-tree was not careful enough
 against corrupt index file.


* hi/gpg-mintrustlevel (2020-01-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-01-22 at af9f594eb7)
 + gpg-interface: add minTrustLevel as a configuration option

 gpg.minTrustLevel configuration variable has been introduced to
 tell various signature verification codepaths the required minimum
 trust level.


* hi/indent-text-with-tabs-in-editorconfig (2020-01-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-01-22 at 3b567252eb)

* hw/commit-advise-while-rejecting (2019-12-19) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-01-15 at 4f16e5a3b6)
 + commit: honor advice.statusHints when rejecting an empty commit

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2019-12-30

 "git commit" gives output similar to "git status" when there is
 nothing to commit, but without honoring the advise.statusHints
 configuration variable, which has been corrected.


* hw/tutorial-favor-switch-over-checkout (2020-01-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-01-15 at 25e4fca9ec)
 + doc/gitcore-tutorial: fix prose to match example command

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2020-01-09

 Complete an update to tutorial that encourages "git switch" over
 "git checkout" that was done only half-way.


* jk/asan-build-fix (2020-01-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-01-22 at 0fc7123d8b)
 + Makefile: use compat regex with SANITIZE=address

 Work around test breakages caused by custom regex engine used in
 libasan, when address sanitizer is used with more recent versions
 of gcc and clang.


* jk/no-flush-upon-disconnecting-slrpc-transport (2020-01-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-01-15 at 5014feacb0)
 + transport: don't flush when disconnecting stateless-rpc helper

  (merged to 'next' on 2020-01-22 at 03cfc1ea0d)
 + fetch test: mark test of "skipping" haves as v0-only
 + t/check-non-portable-shell: detect "FOO= shell_func", too
 + fetch test: avoid use of "VAR= cmd" with a shell function
 (this branch is used by jn/promote-proto2-to-default.)

 The test-lint machinery knew to check "VAR=VAL shell_function"
 construct, but did not check "VAR= shell_funciton", which has been
 corrected.


* js/builtin-add-i-cmds (2020-01-16) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-01-22 at 3cf944ae32)
 + built-in add -i: accept open-ended ranges again
 + built-in add -i: do not try to `patch`/`diff` an empty list of files

* jt/sha1-file-remove-oi-skip-cached (2020-01-02) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-01-15 at 4feaff54f3)
 + sha1-file: remove OBJECT_INFO_SKIP_CACHED

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2020-01-04

 has_object_file() said "no" given an object registered to the
 system via pretend_object_file(), making it inconsistent with
 read_object_file(), causing lazy fetch to attempt fetching an
 empty tree from promisor remotes.


* lh/bool-to-type-bool (2020-01-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-01-22 at 3c140f479f)

 sample templates.


* nd/switch-and-restore (2020-01-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-01-15 at ffd0b1e54e)
 + restore: invalidate cache-tree when removing entries with --staged

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2020-01-09

 "git restore --staged" did not correctly update the cache-tree
 structure, resulting in bogus trees to be written afterwards, which
 has been corrected.


* rt/submodule-i18n (2020-01-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-01-22 at 6b6a52dbe3)
 + submodule.c: mark more strings for translation

 Comments update.


* sg/completion-worktree (2020-01-15) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-01-22 at 9d18889fea)
 + completion: list paths and refs for 'git worktree add'
 + completion: list existing working trees for 'git worktree' subcommands
 + completion: simplify completing 'git worktree' subcommands and options
 + completion: return the index of found word from __git_find_on_cmdline()
 + completion: clean up the __git_find_on_cmdline() helper function
 + t9902-completion: add tests for the __git_find_on_cmdline() helper

 The command line completion (in contrib/) learned to complete
 subcommands and arguments to "git worktree".


* ss/t6025-modernize (2020-01-21) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-01-22 at 00ed0a98ee)
 + t6025: use helpers to replace test -f <path>
 + t6025: modernize style

 Test style updates.

 - remote: clean-up by returning early to avoid one indentation
 - pull --rebase/remote rename: document and honor single-letter abbreviations rebase types
 (this branch uses mr/show-config-scope.)

 "git remote rename X Y" needs to adjust configuration variables
 (e.g. branch.<name>.remote) whose value used to be X to Y.
 branch.<name>.pushRemote is now also updated.

 Waiting for mr/show-config-scope to stabilize.


* es/bright-colors (2020-01-23) 3 commits
 - color.c: alias RGB colors 8-15 to aixterm colors
 - color.c: support bright aixterm colors
 - color.c: refactor color_output arguments

 The basic 7 colors learned the brighter counterparts
 (e.g. "brightred").

 Expecting a reroll.

 - t7400: testcase for submodule status on unregistered inner git repos
 - submodule: fix status of initialized but not cloned submodules
 - t7400: add a testcase for submodule status on empty dirs

 The way "git submodule status" reports an initialized but not yet
 populated submodule has not been reimplemented correctly when a
 part of the "git submodule" command was rewritten in C, which has
 been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ag/rebase-avoid-unneeded-checkout (2020-01-24) 1 commit
 - rebase -i: stop checking out the tip of the branch to rebase

 "git rebase -i" (and friends) used to unnecessarily check out the
 tip of the branch to be rebased, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ds/sparse-checkout-harden (2020-01-31) 15 commits
 - sparse-checkout: fix cone mode behavior mismatch
 - sparse-checkout: improve docs around 'set' in cone mode

 - config: split repo scope to local and worktree
 - t1300: create custom config file without special characters
 - t1300: fix over-indented HERE-DOCs
 - config: fix typo in variable name
 (this branch is used by bw/remote-rename-update-config.)

 "git config" learned to show in which "scope", in addition to in
 which file, each config setting comes from.

 Expecting a (hopefully final) reroll.

* bk/p4-pre-edit-changelist (2020-02-04) 4 commits
 - git-p4: add p4 submit hooks
 - git-p4: add hook p4-pre-edit-changelist
 - git-p4: create new method gitRunHook
 - git-p4: rewrite prompt to be Windows compatible

 "git p4" learned four new hooks and also "--no-verify" option to
 bypass them (and the existing "p4-pre-submit" hook).

 May want to be split better, but the endgame seemed sensible.
 cf. <xmqqmu9y6pr4.fsf@gitster-ct.c.googlers.com>
 

* dt/submodule-rm-with-stale-cache (2020-01-28) 1 commit
 - git rm submodule: succeed if .gitmodules index stat info is zero

 Running "git rm" on a submodule failed unnecessarily when
 .gitmodules is only cache-dirty, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* en/fill-directory-exponential (2020-01-31) 6 commits
 - t7063: blindly accept diffs
 - dir: replace exponential algorithm with a linear one
 - dir: refactor treat_directory to clarify control flow
 - dir: fix confusion based on variable tense
 - dir: fix broken comment
 - dir: consolidate treat_path() and treat_one_path()
 (this branch uses en/fill-directory-fixes-more.)

 The directory traversal code had redundant recursive calls which
 made its performance characteristics exponential wrt the depth of
 the tree, which was corrected.

 Still RFC?
 cf. <pull.700.v2.git.git.1580495486.gitgitgadget@gmail.com>


* hw/doc-git-dir (2020-01-30) 1 commit
 - git: update documentation for --git-dir

 One effect of specifying where the GIT_DIR is (either with the
 environment variable, or with the "git --git-dir=<where> cmd"
 option) is to disable the repository discovery.  This has been
 placed a bit more stress in the documentation, as new users often
 get confused.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jb/parse-options-message-fix (2020-02-05) 1 commit
 - parse-options: lose an unnecessary space in an error message

 Error message fix.

 Waiting for a response

 - notes.c: fix off-by-one error when decreasing notes fanout
 - t3305: check notes fanout more carefully and robustly

 The code to automatically shrink the fan-out in the notes tree had
 an off-by-one bug, which has been killed.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 - merge-recursive: silence -Wxor-used-as-pow warning

 C pedantry ;-) fix.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/diff-honor-wserrhighlight-in-plumbing (2020-01-31) 1 commit
 - diff: move diff.wsErrorHighlight to "basic" config

 The diff-* plumbing family of subcommands now pay attention to the
 diff.wsErrorHighlight configuration, which has been ignored before;
 this allows "git add -p" to also show the whitespace problems to
 the end user.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/escaped-wildcard-dwim (2020-01-27) 1 commit
 - verify_filename(): handle backslashes in "wildcards are pathspecs" rule

 Disambiguation logic to tell revisions and pathspec apart has been
 tweaked so that backslash-escaped glob special characters do not
 count in the "wildcards are pathspec" rule.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/get-oid-error-message-i18n (2020-01-30) 3 commits
 - sha1-name: mark get_oid() error messages for translation
 - t1506: drop space after redirection operator
 - t1400: avoid "test" string comparisons

 A low-level API function get_oid(), that accepts various ways to
 name an object, used to issue end-user facing error messages
 without l10n, which has been updated to be translatable.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/index-pack-dupfix (2020-02-04) 1 commit
 - index-pack: downgrade twice-resolved REF_DELTA to die()

 The index-pack code now diagnoses a bad input packstream that
 records the same object twice when it is used as delta base; the
 code used to declare a software bug when encountering such an
 input, but it is an input error.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/push-default-doc (2020-01-29) 1 commit
 - doc: drop "explicitly given" from push.default description

 Doc update.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 Some codepaths were given a repository instance as a parameter to
 work in the repository, but passed the_repository instance to its
 callees, which has been cleaned up (somewhat).

 Will merge to 'next'.


* pb/do-not-recurse-grep-no-index (2020-01-30) 1 commit
 - grep: ignore --recurse-submodules if --no-index is given

 "git grep --no-index" should not get affected by the contents of
 the .gitmodules file but when "--recurse-submodules" is given or
 the "submodule.recurse" variable is set, it did.  Now these
 settings are ignored in the "--no-index" mode.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* rs/name-rev-memsave (2020-02-05) 11 commits
 - name-rev: sort tip names before applying
 - name-rev: release unused name strings

 - commit-graph.c: remove path normalization, comparison
 - commit-graph.h: store object directory in 'struct commit_graph'
 - commit-graph.h: store an odb in 'struct write_commit_graph_context'
 - t5318: don't pass non-object directory to '--object-dir'
 (this branch is used by tb/commit-graph-split-merge.)

 The code to compute the commit-graph has been taught to use a more
 robust way to tell if two object directories refer to the same
 thing.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* tb/commit-graph-split-merge (2020-02-05) 3 commits
 - builtin/commit-graph.c: support '--input=none'
 - builtin/commit-graph.c: introduce '--input=<source>'
 - builtin/commit-graph.c: support '--split[=<strategy>]'
 (this branch uses tb/commit-graph-object-dir.)

 The code to write out the commit-graph has been taught a few
 options to control if the resulting graph chains should be merged
 or a single new incremental graph is created.

 Will merge to 'next'?

[Stalled]

* jc/format-patch-delay-message-id (2019-04-05) 1 commit
 - format-patch: move message-id and related headers to the end

 The location "git format-patch --thread" adds the Message-Id:
 header in the series of header fields has been moved down, which
 may help working around a suspected bug in GMail MSA, reported at
 <CAHk-=whP1stFZNAaJiMi5eZ9rj0MRt20Y_yHVczZPH+O01d+sA@mail.gmail.com>

 Waiting for feedback to see if it truly helps.
 Needs tests.


* pw/advise-rebase-skip (2019-12-06) 9 commits
 - rebase -i: leave CHERRY_PICK_HEAD when there are conflicts
 - rebase: fix advice when a fixup creates an empty commit
 - commit: give correct advice for empty commit during a rebase
 - commit: encapsulate determine_whence() for sequencer
 - commit: use enum value for multiple cherry-picks
 - sequencer: write CHERRY_PICK_HEAD for reword and edit
 - cherry-pick: check commit error messages
 - cherry-pick: add test for `--skip` advice in `git commit`
 - t3404: use test_cmp_rev

 The mechanism to prevent "git commit" from making an empty commit
 or amending during an interrupted cherry-pick was broken during the
 rewrite of "git rebase" in C, which has been corrected.

 What's the status of this one?
 The tip two are still RFC.


* es/pathspec-f-f-grep (2020-01-13) 1 commit
 . grep: support the --pathspec-from-file option

 "git grep" learned the "--pathspec-from-file" command line

 - rebase: fix --fork-point with short refname

 The "--fork-point" mode of "git rebase" regressed when the command
 was rewritten in C back in 2.20 era, which has been corrected.

 - builtin/config: canonicalize "value_regex" with `--type=bool-or-int`

 - builtin/config: extract `handle_value_regex()` from `get_value()`
 - t1300: modernize part of script
 - config: make `git_parse_maybe_bool_text()` public

 "git config" can be told to affect the existing entries that
 "match" the given value via its value_regex argument.  It learned
 to normalize the value set in the configuration and the value given
 from the command line before computing they "match", e.g. "true" in
 the configuration file can now match with "yes" given from the
 command line.

 Needs a bit more work?

 - rebase -i: re-fix short SHA-1 collision
 - parse_insn_line(): improve error message when parsing failed
 (this branch is used by ag/edit-todo-drop-check.)

 "git rebase -i" identifies existing commits in its todo file with
 their abbreviated object name, which could become ambigous as it
 goes to create new commits, and has a mechanism to avoid ambiguity
 in the main part of its execution.  A few other cases however were
 not covered by the protection against ambiguity, which has been
 corrected.
