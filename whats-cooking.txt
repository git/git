What's cooking in git.git (May 2022, #06; Fri, 20)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen',
and aren't considered "accepted" at all.

This cycle will conclude in early July (https://tinyurl.com/gitCal);
we have just finished the week #4 of the cycle.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

 + ci: reintroduce prevention from perforce being quarantined in macOS
 + ci: avoid brew for installing perforce
 + ci: make failure to find perforce more user friendly

 macOS CI jobs have been occasionally flaky due to tentative version
 skew between perforce and the homebrew packager.  Instead of
 failing the whole CI job, just let it skip the p4 tests when this
 happens.

 + fetch: do not run a redundant fetch from submodule

 "git fetch --recurse-submodules" from multiple remotes (either from

 - git-compat-util: allow root to access both SUDO_UID and root owned
 (this branch uses cb/path-owner-check-with-sudo.)

 "sudo git foo" used to consider a repository owned by the original
 user a safe one to access; it now also considers a repository owned
 by root a safe one, too (after all, if an attacker can craft a
 malicious repository owned by root, the box is 0wned already).

 - hook API: fix v2.36.0 regression: hooks should be connected to a TTY
 - hook API: don't redundantly re-set "no_stdin" and "stdout_to_stderr"
 - hook tests: fix redirection logic error in 96e7225b310

 In Git 2.36 we revamped the way how hooks are invoked.  One change
 that is end-user visible is that the output of a hook is no longer
 directly connected to the standard output of "git" that spawns the
 hook, which was noticed post release.  This is getting corrected.
