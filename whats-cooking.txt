What's cooking in git.git (Jun 2024, #05; Fri, 14)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and
aren't considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL
to a message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity (of course they can be resubmit when new interests
arise).

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-scm/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/

* jk/am-retry (2024-06-06) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2024-06-10 at 4d62361bc7)
 + test-terminal: drop stdin handling
 + am: add explicit "--retry" option

 "git am" has a safety feature to prevent it from starting a new
 session when there already is a session going.  It reliably
 triggers when a mbox is given on the command line, but it has to
 rely on the tty-ness of the standard input.  Add an explicit way to
 opt out of this safety with a command line option.

 format-patch adds it to a single patch, instead of writing it
 before the patch text, to be consistent with what is done for a
 cover letter for a multi-patch series.

 - macOS: ls-files path fails if path of workdir is NFD

 We forgot to normalize the result of getcwd() to NFC on macOS where
 all other paths are normalized, which has been corrected.  This still
 does not address the case where core.precomposeUnicode configuration
 is not defined globally.

 + rebase -i: pass struct replay_opts to parse_insn_line()

 commit, the error experience is not pleasant.  Such an error is now
 caught earlier in the process that parses the todo list.

 . upload-pack: allow configuring a missing-action

 . rev-list: refactor --missing=<missing-action>

 Allow a server S that is a lazy clone of another repository X to
 respond to a request by C that is a lazy clone of S in a way that
 it omits objects it itself does not have (and has to be lazily
 fetched from X).

 I would say this is a terribly irresponsive design, especially
 there is no negociation for S to learn if the objects it is going
 to omit is obtainable by C from elsewhere.
