What's cooking in git.git (Jul 2020, #06; Thu, 30)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'seen' (formerly 'pu'---proposed updates) while commits prefixed
with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

Many topics that have been cooking in 'next' have now been merged to
'master'.  The tip of 'next' will be rewound and rebuilt on top of
the updated 'master', perhaps tomorrow.

During the next cycle for 2.29, we will decide the direction of
follow-up work, if any is needed, for the init.defaultBranch topic
we did the last cycle.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches of the
repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

[Graduated to 'master']

* bc/push-cas-cquoted-refname (2020-07-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-07-21 at fd7bb5c85e)
 + remote-curl: make --force-with-lease work with non-ASCII ref names

 Pushing a ref whose name contains non-ASCII character with the
 "--force-with-lease" option did not work over smart HTTP protocol,
 which has been corrected.


* bw/fail-cloning-into-non-empty (2020-07-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-07-14 at a52b5ce7ab)
 + git clone: don't clone into non-empty directory

 "git clone --separate-git-dir=$elsewhere" used to stomp on the
 contents of the existing directory $elsewhere, which has been
 taught to fail when $elsewhere is not an empty directory.


* cc/pretty-contents-size (2020-07-16) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-07-20 at e7c4b8f9ae)
 + ref-filter: add support for %(contents:size)
 + t6300: test refs pointing to tree and blob
 + Documentation: clarify %(contents:XXXX) doc

 "git for-each-ref --format=<>" learned %(contents:size).


* ct/mv-unmerged-path-error (2020-07-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-07-21 at c17007237a)
 + git-mv: improve error message for conflicted file

 "git mv src dst", when src is an unmerged path, errored out
 correctly but with an incorrect error message to claim that src is
 not tracked, which has been clarified.


* dl/test-must-fail-fixes-6 (2020-07-07) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-07-20 at bd4a9946a6)
 + test-lib-functions: restrict test_must_fail usage
 + t9400: don't use test_must_fail with cvs
 + t9834: remove use of `test_might_fail p4`
 + t7107: don't use test_must_fail()
 + t5324: reorder `run_with_limited_open_files test_might_fail`
 + t3701: stop using `env` in force_color()

 Dev support to limit the use of test_must_fail to only git commands.


* ds/commit-graph-bloom-updates (2020-07-01) 10 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-07-06 at 177e6b362e)
 + commit-graph: check all leading directories in changed path Bloom filters
 + revision: empty pathspecs should not use Bloom filters
 + revision.c: fix whitespace
 + commit-graph: check chunk sizes after writing
 + commit-graph: simplify chunk writes into loop
 + commit-graph: unify the signatures of all write_graph_chunk_*() functions
 + commit-graph: persist existence of changed-paths
 + bloom: fix logic in get_bloom_filter()
 + commit-graph: change test to die on parse, not load
 + commit-graph: place bloom_settings in context
 (this branch uses sg/commit-graph-cleanups.)

 Updates to the changed-paths bloom filter.


* en/fill-directory-exponential (2020-07-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-07-22 at 63662d6646)
 + dir: check pathspecs before returning `path_excluded`

 Fix to a regression introduced during 2.27 cycle.


* hn/reftable (2020-07-10) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-07-14 at e524883fec)
 + reflog: cleanse messages in the refs.c layer
 + bisect: treat BISECT_HEAD as a pseudo ref
 + t3432: use git-reflog to inspect the reflog for HEAD
 + lib-t6000.sh: write tag using git-update-ref
 (this branch is used by hn/reftable-prep-part-2.)

 Preliminary clean-up of the refs API in preparation for adding a
 new refs backend "reftable".


* jk/reject-newer-extensions-in-v0 (2020-07-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-07-16 at 85f634d5a6)
 + verify_repository_format(): complain about new extensions in v0 repo

 With the base fix to 2.27 regresion, any new extensions in a v0
 repository would still be silently honored, which is not quite
 right.  Instead, complain and die loudly.


* jk/tests-timestamp-fix (2020-07-15) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-07-16 at 2c69e97b92)
 + t9100: stop depending on commit timestamps
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-07-14 at 66ee0e6b45)
 + test-lib: set deterministic default author/committer date
 + t9100: explicitly unset GIT_COMMITTER_DATE
 + t5539: make timestamp requirements more explicit
 + t9700: loosen ident timezone regex
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-07-09 at 633bcd552f)
 + t6000: use test_tick consistently

 The test framework has been updated so that most tests will run
 with predictable (artificial) timestamps.


* jt/avoid-lazy-fetching-upon-have-check (2020-07-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-07-20 at 28e85288e5)
 + upload-pack: do not lazy-fetch "have" objects

 Fetching from a lazily cloned repository resulted at the server
 side in attempts to lazy fetch objects that the client side has,
 many of which will not be available from the third-party anyway.


* pb/log-rev-list-doc (2020-07-08) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-07-14 at f1104dfb77)
 + git-log.txt: include rev-list-description.txt
 + git-rev-list.txt: move description to separate file
 + git-rev-list.txt: tweak wording in set operations
 + git-rev-list.txt: fix Asciidoc syntax
 + revisions.txt: describe 'rev1 rev2 ...' meaning for ranges
 + git-log.txt: add links to 'rev-list' and 'diff' docs

 "git help log" has been enhanced by sharing more material from the
 documentation for the underlying "git rev-list" command.


* rs/add-index-entry-optim-fix (2020-07-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-07-20 at 617fe6aecc)
 + read-cache: remove bogus shortcut

 Fix to an ancient bug caused by an over-eager attempt for
 optimization.


* sg/commit-graph-cleanups (2020-06-08) 10 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-07-06 at 15c9d77eb9)
 + commit-graph: simplify write_commit_graph_file() #2
 + commit-graph: simplify write_commit_graph_file() #1
 + commit-graph: simplify parse_commit_graph() #2
 + commit-graph: simplify parse_commit_graph() #1
 + commit-graph: clean up #includes
 + diff.h: drop diff_tree_oid() & friends' return value
 + commit-slab: add a function to deep free entries on the slab
 + commit-graph-format.txt: all multi-byte numbers are in network byte order
 + commit-graph: fix parsing the Chunk Lookup table
 + tree-walk.c: don't match submodule entries for 'submod/anything'
 (this branch is used by ds/commit-graph-bloom-updates.)

 The changed-path Bloom filter is improved using ideas from an
 independent implementation.

[New Topics]

* en/typofixes (2020-07-28) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-07-30 at 64776daa9a)
 + hashmap: fix typo in usage docs
 + Remove doubled words in various comments

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/log-fp-implies-m (2020-07-29) 7 commits
 - doc/git-log: clarify handling of merge commit diffs
 - doc/git-log: move "-t" into diff-options list
 - doc/git-log: drop "-r" diff option
 - doc/git-log: move "Diff Formatting" from rev-list-options
 - log: enable "-m" automatically with "--first-parent"
 - revision: add "--no-diff-merges" option to counteract "-m"
 - log: drop "--cc implies -m" logic

 "git log --first-parent -p" showed patches only for single-parent
 commits on the first-parent chain; the "--first-parent" option has
 been made to imply "-m".  Use "--no-diff-merges" to restore the
 previous behaviour to omit patches for merge commits.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/strvec (2020-07-28) 11 commits
 - strvec: rename struct fields
 - strvec: drop argv_array compatibility layer
 - strvec: update documention to avoid argv_array
 - strvec: fix indentation in renamed calls
 - strvec: convert remaining callers away from argv_array name
 - strvec: convert more callers away from argv_array name
 - strvec: convert builtin/ callers away from argv_array name
 - quote: rename sq_dequote_to_argv_array to mention strvec
 - strvec: rename files from argv-array to strvec
 - argv-array: rename to strvec
 - argv-array: use size_t for count and alloc

 The argv_array API is useful for not just managing argv but any
 "vector" (NULL-terminated array) of strings, and has seen adoption
 to a certain degree.  It has been renamed to "strvec" to reduce the
 barrier to adoption.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* rs/grep-simpler-parse-object-or-die-call (2020-07-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-07-30 at 6d22dd3058)
 + grep: avoid using oid_to_hex() with parse_object_or_die()

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ar/help-guides-doc (2020-07-29) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-07-30 at e4b0370bfa)

 Will merge to 'master'.


* sk/typofixes (2020-07-29) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-07-30 at c56d9e5313)
 + comment: fix spelling mistakes inside comments

 Will merge to 'master'.


* pd/mergetool-nvimdiff (2020-07-29) 2 commits
 - mergetools: add support for nvimdiff (neovim) family
 - mergetool--lib: improve support for vimdiff-style tool variants

 The existing backends for "git mergetool" based on variants of vim
 have been refactored and then support for "nvim" has been added.


* al/bisect-first-parent (2020-07-29) 3 commits
 - bisect: combine args passed to find_bisection()
 - bisect: introduce first-parent flag
 - rev-list: allow bisect and first-parent flags

 "git bisect" learns the "--first-parent" option to find the first
 breakage along the first-parent chain.


* jc/fmt-merge-msg-suppress-destination (2020-07-30) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-07-30 at c44f57f46d)
 + fmt-merge-msg: allow merge destination to be omitted again
 + Revert "fmt-merge-msg: stop treating `master` specially"

 "git merge" learned to selectively omit " into <branch>" at the end
 of the title of default merge message with merge.suppressDest
 configuration.

 Will merge to 'master'.

[Stalled]

* jx/proc-receive-hook (2020-05-18) 11 commits
 . doc: add documentation for the proc-receive hook
 . transport: parse report options for tracking refs
 . t5411: test updates of remote-tracking branches
 . receive-pack: new config receive.procReceiveRefs
 . refs.c: refactor to reuse ref_is_hidden()
 . receive-pack: feed report options to post-receive
 . doc: add document for capability report-status-v2
 . New capability "report-status-v2" for git-push
 . receive-pack: add new proc-receive hook
 . t5411: add basic test cases for proc-receive hook
 . transport: not report a non-head push as a branch

 "git receive-pack" that accepts requests by "git push" learned to
 outsource most of the ref updates to the new "proc-receive" hook.

 Ejected out of 'seen'; somehow its tests seem to break with clang
 cf. https://travis-ci.org/github/git/git/builds/713443572


* mf/submodule-summary-with-correct-repository (2020-06-24) 2 commits
 - submodule: use submodule repository when preparing summary
 - revision: use repository from rev_info when parsing commits

 "git diff/show" on a change that involves a submodule used to read
 the information on commits in the submodule from a wrong repository
 and gave a wrong information when the commit-graph is involved.

 Needs tests.


* dr/push-remoteref-fix (2020-04-23) 1 commit
 - remote.c: fix handling of %(push:remoteref)

 The "%(push:remoteref)" placeholder in the "--format=" argument of
 "git format-patch" (and friends) only showed what got explicitly
 configured, not what ref at the receiving end would be updated when
 "git push" was used, as it ignored the default behaviour (e.g. update
 the same ref as the source).

 Expecting a reroll.
 cf. <20200416152145.wp2zeibxmuyas6y6@feanor>


* mr/bisect-in-c-2 (2020-07-17) 14 commits
 . SQUASH??? do not add new users of git_path_bisect_head()
 . bisect--helper: retire `--bisect-autostart` subcommand
 . bisect--helper: retire `--write-terms` subcommand
 . bisect--helper: retire `--check-expected-revs` subcommand
 . bisect--helper: reimplement `bisect_state` & `bisect_head` shell functions in C
 . bisect--helper: retire `--next-all` subcommand
 . bisect--helper: retire `--bisect-clean-state` subcommand
 . bisect--helper: finish porting `bisect_start()` to C
 . bisect--helper: reimplement `bisect_next` and `bisect_auto_next` shell functions in C
 . bisect: call 'clear_commit_marks_all()' in 'bisect_next_all()'
 . bisect--helper: reimplement `bisect_autostart` shell function in C
 . bisect--helper: introduce new `write_in_file()` function
 . bisect--helper: use '-res' in 'cmd_bisect__helper' return
 . bisect--helper: BUG() in cmd_*() on invalid subcommand

 Rewrite of the remainder of "git bisect" script in C continues.

 Needs more work.
 Ejected out of 'seen'; al/bisect-first-parent topic has a bit of
 textual conflict with this topic.


* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2018-10-15) 1 commit
 - zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

* jb/doc-packfile-name (2020-07-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-07-30 at b46c3f6675)
 + pack-write/docs: update regarding pack naming

 Doc update.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* dd/send-email-config (2020-07-23) 1 commit
 - git-send-email: die if sendmail.* config is set

 Stop when "sendmail.*" configuration variables are defined, which
 could be a mistaken attempt to define "sendemail.*" variables.


* jt/pack-objects-prefetch-in-batch (2020-07-21) 2 commits
 - pack-objects: prefetch objects to be packed
 - pack-objects: refactor to oid_object_info_extended

 While packing many objects in a repository with a promissor remote,
 lazily fetching missing objects from the promissor remote one by
 one may be inefficient---the code now attempts to fetch all the
 missing objects in batch (obviously this won't work for a lazy
 clone that lazily fetches tree objects as you cannot even enumerate
 what blobs are missing until you learn which trees are missing).

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jt/pretend-object-never-come-from-elsewhere (2020-07-21) 1 commit
 - sha1-file: make pretend_object_file() not prefetch

 The pretend-object mechanism checks if the given object already
 exists in the object store before deciding to keep the data
 in-core, but the check would have triggered lazy fetching of such
 an object from a promissor remote.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sg/ci-git-path-fix-with-pyenv (2020-07-23) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-07-30 at afe304633d)
 + ci: use absolute PYTHON_PATH in the Linux jobs

 CI fixup---tests of Python scripts didn't use the version of Git
 that is being tested.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 - t1001: use $ZERO_OID
 - t: make test-bloom initialize repository

 The final leg of SHA-256 transition.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jc/no-update-fetch-head (2020-07-29) 1 commit
 - fetch: optionally allow disabling FETCH_HEAD update

 "git fetch" learned the "--[no-]write-fetch-head" option to
 optionally stop describing what was fetched in FETCH_HEAD.

 Needs more work.


* mp/complete-show-color-moved (2020-07-15) 1 commit
 - completion: add show --color-moved[-ws]

 Command line completion (in contrib/) update.

 Will merge to 'next'.
 A follow-up patch to reduce duplication may be warranted.


* hn/reftable-prep-part-2 (2020-07-27) 3 commits
 - Make HEAD a PSEUDOREF rather than PER_WORKTREE.
 - Modify pseudo refs through ref backend storage
 - t1400: use git rev-parse for testing PSEUDOREF existence

 - maintenance: replace run_auto_gc()
 - maintenance: add --quiet option
 - maintenance: create basic maintenance runner

 A "git gc"'s big brother has been introduced to take care of more
 repository maintenance tasks, not limited to the object database
 cleaning.


* ls/mergetool-meld-auto-merge (2020-07-12) 2 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - Support auto-merge for meld to follow the vim-diff behavior

 The 'meld' backend of the "git mergetool" learned to give the
 underlying 'meld' the '--auto-merge' option, which would help
 reduce the amount of text that requires manual merging.

 Expecting a reroll.


* tb/upload-pack-filters (2020-07-22) 4 commits
 - upload-pack.c: introduce 'uploadpackfilter.tree.maxDepth'
 - upload-pack.c: pass 'struct list_objects_filter_options *'
 - upload-pack.c: allow banning certain object filter(s)
 - list_objects_filter_options: introduce 'list_object_filter_config_name'

 The component to respond to "git fetch" request is made more
 configurable to selectively allow or reject object filtering
 specification used for partial cloning.


* mt/hash-to-hex-thread-safety (2020-06-26) 2 commits
 - hex: make hash_to_hex_algop() and friends thread-safe
 - compat/win32/pthread: add pthread_once()

 hash_to_hex() used a set of rotating static buffers, which was not
 safe to use in a threaded environment.  This has been made safer by
 using thread-local storage.

 Expecting a reroll.

 - hook: add --porcelain to list command
 - hook: add list command
 - hook: scaffolding for git-hook subcommand
 - doc: propose hooks managed by the config

 The "hooks defined in config" topic.

 What's the status of this one?  Abandoned?


* pw/rebase-i-more-options (2020-07-16) 5 commits
 - rebase: add --reset-author-date
 - rebase -i: support --ignore-date
 - sequencer: rename amend_author to author_to_free
 - rebase -i: support --committer-date-is-author-date
 - rebase -i: add --ignore-whitespace flag

 "git rebase -i" learns a bit more options.

 - t/helper/test-config: return exit codes consistently
 - doc: grep: unify info on configuration variables

 "git grep" has been tweaked to be limited to the sparse checkout
 paths.

 Review needed on 4/6; otherwise looking sane.
