What's cooking in git.git (Jun 2022, #06; Fri, 17)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen',
and aren't considered "accepted" at all.

Git 2.37-rc1 has been tagged.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

Release tarballs are available at:

* cr/setup-bug-typo (2022-06-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2022-06-17 at 8834ffe0ab)
 + setup: fix function name in a BUG() message

 Typofix in a BUG() message.

 Will cook in 'next'.

* zk/push-use-bitmaps (2022-06-17) 1 commit
 - send-pack.c: add config push.useBitmaps

 "git push" sometimes perform poorly when reachability bitmaps are
 used, even in a repository where other operations are helped by
 bitmaps.  The push.useBitmaps configuration variable is introduced
 to allow disabling use of reachability bitmaps only for "git push".

 Rename fetch.credentialsInUrl to transfer.credentialsInUrl as the
 single configuration variable should work both in pushing and

 "sudo git foo" used to consider a repository owned by the original
 user a safe one to access; it now also considers a repository owned
 by root a safe one, too (after all, if an attacker can craft a
 malicious repository owned by root, the box is 0wned already).
