What's cooking in git.git (Jan 2018, #03; Tue, 23)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

Many topics in 'next' have been merged to 'master' while others are
tentatively kicked back to 'pu', to give them a chance to be rerolled
if the authors of them wish to do so.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

[Graduated to "master"]

* ab/commit-m-with-fixup (2017-12-22) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-01-11 at 41255c464f)
 + commit: add support for --fixup <commit> -m"<extra message>"
 + commit doc: document that -c, -C, -F and --fixup with -m error

 "git commit --fixup" did not allow "-m<message>" option to be used
 at the same time; allow it to annotate resulting commit with more
 text.

  (merged to 'next' on 2017-12-28 at c6254494e3)
 + describe: prepend "tags/" when describing tags with embedded name

 An old regression in "git describe --all $annotated_tag^0" has been
 fixed.


* ew/empty-merge-with-dirty-index (2018-01-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-01-09 at 6bcda11248)
 + Merge branch 'ew/empty-merge-with-dirty-index-maint' into ew/empty-merge-with-dirty-index
 (this branch uses ew/empty-merge-with-dirty-index-maint.)

 "git merge -s recursive" did not correctly abort when the index is
 dirty, if the merged tree happened to be the same as the current
 HEAD, which has been fixed.


* jc/merge-symlink-ours-theirs (2018-01-03) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-01-05 at 63ebfc45eb)
 + merge: teach -Xours/-Xtheirs to symbolic link merge

  (merged to 'next' on 2018-01-11 at 56808f6969)
 + oidset: don't return value from oidset_init

 Hotfix for a topic already in 'master'.


* jk/abort-clone-with-existing-dest (2018-01-03) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-01-09 at 3c8e83c3a7)
 + clone: do not clean up directories we didn't create
 + clone: factor out dir_exists() helper
 + t5600: modernize style
 + t5600: fix outdated comment about unborn HEAD

 "git clone $there $here" is allowed even when here directory exists
 as long as it is an empty directory, but the command incorrectly
 removed it upon a failure of the operation.


* jm/svn-pushmergeinfo-fix (2017-09-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-01-05 at 6cb237ea44)
 + git-svn: fix svn.pushmergeinfo handling of svn+ssh usernames.

 "git svn dcommit" did not take into account the fact that a
 svn+ssh:// URL with a username@ (typically used for pushing) refers
 to the same SVN repository without the username@ and failed when
 svn.pushmergeinfo option is set.


* js/fix-merge-arg-quoting-in-rebase-p (2018-01-05) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-01-09 at 91f5601e9c)

 "git rebase -p -X<option>" did not propagate the option properly
 down to underlying merge strategy backend.

  (merged to 'next' on 2018-01-17 at dd4867706b)
 + send-email: add test for Linux's get_maintainer.pl
 + perl/Git: remove now useless email-address parsing code
 + send-email: add and use a local copy of Mail::Address

 Instead of maintaining home-grown email address parsing code, ship
 a copy of reasonably recent Mail::Address to be used as a fallback
 in 'git send-email' when the platform lacks it.


* nd/add-i-ignore-submodules (2018-01-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-01-17 at 632401fd5a)
 + add--interactive: ignore submodule changes except HEAD

 "git add -p" was taught to ignore local changes to submodules as
 they do not interfere with the partial addition of regular changes
 anyway.


* nd/ita-wt-renames-in-status (2017-12-27) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-12-28 at 7610331a11)
 + wt-status.c: handle worktree renames
 + wt-status.c: rename rename-related fields in wt_status_change_data
 + wt-status.c: catch unhandled diff status codes
 + wt-status.c: coding style fix
 + Use DIFF_DETECT_RENAME for detect_rename assignments
 + t2203: test status output with porcelain v2 format

 "git status" after moving a path in the working tree (hence making
 it appear "removed") and then adding with the -N option (hence
 making that appear "added") detected it as a rename, but did not
 report the  old and new pathnames correctly.


* rs/lose-leak-pending (2017-12-28) 9 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-01-05 at 05305f7f2f)

 + ref-filter: use clear_commit_marks_many() in do_merge_filter()
 + commit: use clear_commit_marks_many() in remove_redundant()
 + commit: avoid allocation in clear_commit_marks_many()

 API clean-up around revision traversal.


* sb/diff-blobfind-pickaxe (2018-01-04) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-01-09 at 2053890477)
 + diff: use HAS_MULTI_BITS instead of counting bits manually
 + diff: properly error out when combining multiple pickaxe options
 + diffcore: add a pickaxe option to find a specific blob
 + diff: introduce DIFF_PICKAXE_KINDS_MASK
 + diff: migrate diff_flags.pickaxe_ignore_case to a pickaxe_opts bit
 + diff.h: make pickaxe_opts an unsigned bit field

 "diff" family of commands learned "--find-object=<object-id>" option
 to limit the findings to changes that involve the named object.


* sb/submodule-update-reset-fix (2018-01-05) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-01-11 at e4e84b69a3)
 + submodule: submodule_move_head omits old argument in forced case
 + unpack-trees: oneway_merge to update submodules
 + t/lib-submodule-update.sh: fix test ignoring ignored files in submodules
 + t/lib-submodule-update.sh: clarify test

 When resetting the working tree files recursively, the working tree
 of submodules are now also reset to match.


* tg/stash-with-pathspec-fix (2018-01-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-01-11 at abfaa14a7b)
 + stash: don't delete untracked files that match pathspec

 "git stash -- <pathspec>" incorrectly blew away untracked files in
 the directory that matched the pathspec, which has been corrected.


* tg/worktree-create-tracking (2018-01-11) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-01-11 at df6423dfc4)
 + Documentation/git-worktree.txt: add missing `

 Doc hotfix.


* ys/bisect-object-id-missing-conversion-fix (2018-01-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-01-11 at ca330c885d)
 + bisect: debug: convert struct object to object_id

 Fix for a commented-out code to adjust it to a rather old API change.

* dj/runtime-prefix (2017-12-05) 4 commits
 . exec_cmd: RUNTIME_PREFIX on some POSIX systems
 . Makefile: add Perl runtime prefix support
 . Makefile: add support for "perllibdir"
 . Makefile: generate Perl header from template file

 A build-time option has been added to allow Git to be told to refer
 to its associated files relative to the main binary, in the same
 way that has been possible on Windows for quite some time, for
 Linux, BSDs and Darwin.

 Tentatively kicked out of 'next' to see how well another topic
 ab/simplify-perl-makefile that heavily conflicts with this fares.


* mk/http-backend-content-length (2017-11-27) 4 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - t5560-http-backend-noserver.sh: add CONTENT_LENGTH cases
 - SQUASH???
 - http-backend: respect CONTENT_LENGTH as specified by rfc3875

 The http-backend (used for smart-http transport) used to slurp the
 whole input until EOF, without paying attention to CONTENT_LENGTH
 that is supplied in the environment and instead expecting the Web
 server to close the input stream.  This has been fixed.

 Expecting a reroll.
 Suggested fixes to be used when rerolling is queued, but I'd
 prefer _not_ squashing them myself.

 Also, it may be too complex solution for the problem.
 cf. <20171204171308.GA13332@sigill.intra.peff.net>


* cc/require-tcl-tk-for-build (2017-11-29) 2 commits
 - travis-ci: avoid new tcl/tk build requirement
 - Makefile: check that tcl/tk is installed

 A first-time builder of Git may have installed neither tclsh nor
 msgfmt, in which case git-gui and gitk part will fail and break the
 build.  As a workaround, refuse to run a build when tclsh is not
 installed and NO_TCLTK is not set.

 Undecided.
 I still feel that requring tclsh to be installed, with or without
 "escape hatch" for experts, may be too heavy-handed.


* mg/merge-base-fork-point (2017-09-17) 3 commits
 - merge-base: find fork-point outside partial reflog
 - merge-base: return fork-point outside reflog
 - t6010: test actual test output

 "merge-base --fork-point $branch $commit" is used to guess on which
 commit among the commits that were once at the tip of the $branch the
 $commit was built on top of, and it learns these historical tips from
 the reflog of the $branch.  When the true fork-point is lost due to
 pruning of old reflog entries, the command does not give any output,
 because it has no way to guess correctly and does not want to mislead
 the user with a wrong guess.

 The command has been updated to give the best but not known to be
 correct guess, based on a hope that a merge-base between $commit and a
 virtual merge across all the reflog entries that still are available
 for $branch may still be a closer to the true fork-point than the
 merge-base between $commit and the current tip of the $branch.

 This may have to be offered by an additional option, to allow the
 users that are prepared to see a potentially incorrect guess to opt
 into the feature, without affecting the current callers that may not
 be prepared to accept a guess that is not known to be correct.

 What's the doneness of this one?


* jk/drop-ancient-curl (2017-08-09) 5 commits
 - http: #error on too-old curl

 - http: drop support for curl < 7.19.4
 - http: drop support for curl < 7.16.0

 Some code in http.c that has bitrot is being removed.

 Expecting a reroll.


* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2017-08-10) 1 commit
 . zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

 Needs resurrecting by making sure the fix is good and still applies
 (or adjusted to today's codebase).


* mg/status-in-progress-info (2017-05-10) 2 commits
 - status --short --inprogress: spell it as --in-progress
 - status: show in-progress info for short status

 "git status" learns an option to report various operations
 (e.g. "merging") that the user is in the middle of.

* nd/fix-untracked-cache-invalidation (2018-01-19) 6 commits
 - dir.c: print correct errno when opendir() fails
 - dir.c: stop ignoring opendir() error in open_cached_dir()
 - update-index doc: note a fixed bug in the untracked cache
 - dir.c: fix missing dir invalidation in untracked code

 - send-email: extract email-parsing code into a subroutine

 Code refactoring.

 Undecided.


* ab/sha1dc-build (2017-12-12) 4 commits
 . Makefile: use the sha1collisiondetection submodule by default
 - sha1dc_git.h: re-arrange an ifdef chain for a subsequent change
 - Makefile: under "make dist", include the sha1collisiondetection submodule
 - Makefile: don't error out under DC_SHA1_EXTERNAL if DC_SHA1_SUBMODULE=auto

 Push the submodule version of collision-detecting SHA-1 hash
 implementation a bit harder on builders.

 The earlier two may make sense, but leaning toward rejecting the last step.

* ab/simplify-perl-makefile (2018-01-03) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-01-23 at 1506e0651a)
 + perl: treat PERLLIB_EXTRA as an extra path again
 + perl: avoid *.pmc and fix Error.pm further
 + Makefile: replace perl/Makefile.PL with simple make rules

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2018-01-03

 The build procedure for perl/ part has been greatly simplified by
 weaning ourselves off of MakeMaker.

 Will cook in 'next'.

 (this branch uses en/merge-recursive-fixes.)

 Rename detection logic in "diff" family that is used in "merge" has
 learned to guess when all of x/a, x/b and x/c have moved to z/a,
 z/b and z/c, it is likely that x/d added in the meantime would also
 want to move to z/d by taking the hint that the entire directory
 'x' moved to 'z'.


* pw/sequencer-in-process-commit (2018-01-23) 13 commits
 - sequencer: run 'prepare-commit-msg' hook
 - t7505: add tests for cherry-pick and rebase -i/-p
 - sequencer: assign only free()able strings to gpg_sign
 - sequencer: improve config handling
 - t3512/t3513: remove KNOWN_FAILURE_CHERRY_PICK_SEES_EMPTY_COMMIT=1
 - sequencer: try to commit without forking 'git commit'
 - sequencer: load commit related config
 - sequencer: simplify adding Signed-off-by: trailer
 - commit: move print_commit_summary() to libgit
 - commit: move post-rewrite code to libgit
 - Add a function to update HEAD after creating a commit
 - commit: move empty message checks to libgit
 - t3404: check intermediate squash messages

 The sequencer infrastructure is shared across "git cherry-pick",
 "git rebase -i", etc., and has always spawned "git commit" when it
 needs to create a commit.  It has been taught to do so internally,
 when able, by reusing the codepath "git commit" itself uses, which
 gives performance boost for a few tens of percents in some sample
 scenarios.


* jh/fsck-promisors (2017-12-08) 10 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-01-23 at ca59f5c18e)
 + gc: do not repack promisor packfiles
 + rev-list: support termination at promisor objects
 + sha1_file: support lazily fetching missing objects
 + introduce fetch-object: fetch one promisor object
 + index-pack: refactor writing of .keep files
 + fsck: support promisor objects as CLI argument
 + fsck: support referenced promisor objects
 + fsck: support refs pointing to promisor objects
 + fsck: introduce partialclone extension
 + extension.partialclone: introduce partial clone extension
 (this branch is used by jh/partial-clone.)

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2018-01-17

 In preparation for implementing narrow/partial clone, the machinery
 for checking object connectivity used by gc and fsck has been
 taught that a missing object is OK when it is referenced by a
 packfile specially marked as coming from trusted repository that
 promises to make them available on-demand and lazily.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* jh/partial-clone (2017-12-08) 13 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-01-23 at de0f0111ea)
 + t5616: test bulk prefetch after partial fetch

 + fetch-pack: add --no-filter
 + fetch-pack, index-pack, transport: partial clone
 + upload-pack: add object filtering for partial clone
 (this branch uses jh/fsck-promisors.)

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2018-01-17

 The machinery to clone & fetch, which in turn involves packing and
 unpacking objects, have been told how to omit certain objects using
 the filtering mechanism introduced by the jh/object-filtering
 topic, and also mark the resulting pack as a promisor pack to
 tolerate missing objects, taking advantage of the mechanism
 introduced by the jh/fsck-promisors topic.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* ot/mru-on-list (2017-10-01) 1 commit
 - mru: use double-linked list from list.h

 The first step to getting rid of mru API and using the
 doubly-linked list API directly instead.

 A follow-up is being worked on; it seems to be almost ready.
