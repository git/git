What's cooking in git.git (Apr 2013, #05; Mon, 15)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* jk/diff-algo-finishing-touches (2013-04-05) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-11 at af83b2b)
 + diff: allow unstuck arguments with --diff-algorithm
 + git-merge(1): document diff-algorithm option to merge-recursive

 "git diff --diff-algorithm algo" is also understood as "git diff
 --diff-algorithm=algo".


* jk/diff-graph-submodule-summary (2013-04-05) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-11 at 70dfa8d)
 + submodule: print graph output next to submodule log

 Make "git diff --graph" work better with submodule log output.


* jk/http-error-messages (2013-04-06) 9 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-11 at 7a03981)
 + http: drop http_error function
 + remote-curl: die directly with http error messages
 + http: re-word http error message
 + http: simplify http_error helper function
 + remote-curl: consistently report repo url for http errors
 + remote-curl: always show friendlier 404 message
 + remote-curl: let servers override http 404 advice
 + remote-curl: show server content on http errors
 + http: add HTTP_KEEP_ERROR option

 Improve error reporting from the http transfer clients.


* jk/show-branch-strbuf (2013-04-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-11 at 7a20aa5)
 + show-branch: use strbuf instead of static buffer

 "git show-branch" was not prepared to show a very long run of
 ancestor operators e.g. foobar^2~2^2^2^2...^2~4 correctly.


* lf/bundle-with-tip-wo-message (2013-04-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-11 at bb9f869)
 + bundle: Accept prerequisites without commit messages

 "git bundle" did not like a bundle created using a commit without
 any message as its one of the prerequistes.


* po/help-guides (2013-04-03) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-04 at 3d99b28)
 + doc: include --guide option description for "git help"
 + help: mention -a and -g option, and 'git help <concept>' usage.
 + builtin/help.c: add list_common_guides_help() function
 + builtin/help.c: add --guide option
 + builtin/help.c: split "-a" processing into two

 "git help" learned "-g" option to show the list of guides just like
 list of commands are given with "-a".
 * po/help-guides (2013-04-12) 1 commit
 - help: mark common_guides[] as translatable

 Finishing touches.


* rt/commentchar-fmt-merge-msg (2013-04-07) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-11 at 6af638b)
 + fmt-merge-msg: use core.commentchar in tag signatures completely
 + fmt-merge-msg: respect core.commentchar in people credits

 The new core.commentchar configuration was not applied to a few
 places.


* tr/perl-keep-stderr-open (2013-04-04) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-07 at 04f737a)
 + t9700: do not close STDERR
 + perl: redirect stderr to /dev/null instead of closing

 Closing (not redirecting to /dev/null) the standard error stream is
 not a very smart thing to do.  Later open may return file
 descriptor #2 for unrelated purpose, and error reporting code may
 write into them.

--------------------------------------------------

 issue a warning when using those that don't.

 Comments?


* jn/config-ignore-inaccessible (2013-04-15) 1 commit
 - config: allow inaccessible configuration under $HOME

 When $HOME is misconfigured to point at an unreadable directory, we
 used to complain and die. This loosens the check.

 I do not think we agreed that this is a good idea, though.


* jn/gitweb-install-doc (2013-04-15) 1 commit
 - gitweb/INSTALL: Simplify description of GITWEB_CONFIG_SYSTEM

 Reword gitweb configuration instrutions.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 - i18n: branch: mark strings for translation

 Will merge to 'master'.


* nd/checkout-keep-sparse (2013-04-15) 1 commit
 - checkout: add --ignore-skip-worktree-bits in sparse checkout mode

 Make the initial "sparse" selection of the paths more sticky across
 "git checkout".

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ta/glossary (2013-04-15) 4 commits
 - glossary: improve definitions of refspec and pathspec
 - The name of the hash function is "SHA-1", not "SHA1"

 - glossary: remove outdated/misleading/irrelevant entries

 Will merge to 'next'.


* th/bisect-final-log (2013-04-15) 1 commit
 - bisect: Store first bad commit as comment in log file

 Will merge to 'next'.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* nd/pretty-formats (2013-04-01) 12 commits
 - pretty: support %>> that steal trailing spaces
 - pretty: support truncating in %>, %< and %><
 - pretty: support padding placeholders, %< %> and %><

 - pretty: get the correct encoding for --pretty:format=%e
 - pretty: save commit encoding from logmsg_reencode if the caller needs it
 - utf8.c: add utf8_strnwidth() with the ability to skip ansi sequences
 - utf8.c: move display_mode_esc_sequence_len() for use by other functions
 - pretty: share code between format_decoration and show_decorations
 - pretty-formats.txt: wrap long lines

 A mixed bag of a bugfix and two fun enhancements on pretty formats
 placeholder.

 Expecting a reroll.


* jc/format-patch (2013-02-21) 2 commits
 - format-patch: --inline-single
 - format-patch: rename "no_inline" field

 A new option to send a single patch to the standard output to be
 appended at the bottom of a message.  I personally have no need for
 this, but it was easy enough to cobble together.  Tests, docs and
 stripping out more MIMEy stuff are left as exercises to interested
 parties.

 Not ready for inclusion.

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* ap/strbuf-humanize (2013-04-10) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-14 at 66d7af5)
 + count-objects: add -H option to humanize sizes
 + strbuf: create strbuf_humanise_bytes() to show byte sizes

 Teach "--human-readable" aka "-H" option to "git count-objects" to
 show various large numbers in Ki/Mi/GiB scaled as necessary.

 I've decided to let this topic supersede mc/count-objects-kibibytes.
 Human users will get an even easier output with "-H" and by not
 changing the output without an explicit option we do not have to
 break third-party tools that may have been reading from the output
 of this command.


* as/clone-reference-with-gitfile (2013-04-09) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-15 at ab0d128)
 + clone: Allow repo using gitfile as a reference
 + clone: Fix error message for reference repository

 "git clone" did not work if a repository pointed at by the
 "--reference" option is a gitfile that points at another place.

 Waiting for comments.


* fc/transport-helper-error-reporting (2013-04-11) 3 commits
 - transport-helper: improve push messages
 - transport-helper: mention helper name when it dies
 - transport-helper: report errors properly

 Rerolled enough times.  In-code comments may want to be further
 extended to explain tricky parts, but seems to be ready otherwise.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/doc-http-backend (2013-04-13) 3 commits
 - doc/http-backend: match query-string in apache half-auth example
 - doc/http-backend: give some lighttpd config examples
 - doc/http-backend: clarify "half-auth" repo configuration

 Improve documentation to illustrate "push authenticated, fetch
 anonymous" configuration for smart HTTP servers.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/gitweb-utf8 (2013-04-08) 4 commits
 - gitweb: Fix broken blob action parameters on blob/commitdiff pages
 - gitweb: Don't append ';js=(0|1)' to external links
 - gitweb: Make feed title valid utf8
 - gitweb: Fix utf8 encoding for blob_plain, blobdiff_plain, commitdiff_plain, and patch

 Various fixes to gitweb.

 Waiting for a reroll after a review.


* jk/submodule-subdirectory-ok (2013-04-10) 2 commits
 - submodule: drop the top-level requirement
 - rev-parse: add --prefix option

 Allow various subcommands of "git submodule" to be run not from the
 top of the working tree of the superproject.

 Waiting for comments.


* kb/co-orphan-suggestion-short-sha1 (2013-04-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-14 at 8caf7fd)
 + checkout: abbreviate hash in suggest_reattach

 Update the informational message when "git checkout" leaves the
 detached head state.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* mv/sequencer-pick-error-diag (2013-04-11) 1 commit
 - cherry-pick: make sure all input objects are commits

 "git cherry-pick $blob $tree" is diagnosed as a nonsense.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* rs/empty-archive (2013-04-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-15 at eab39bc)
 + t5004: fix issue with empty archive test and bsdtar

 Implementations of "tar" of BSD descend have found to have trouble
 with reading an otherwise empty tar archive with pax headers and
 causes an unnecessary test failure.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* th/t9903-symlinked-workdir (2013-04-11) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-15 at f062dc6)
 + t9903: Don't fail when run from path accessed through symlink

 Will merge to 'master'.


* fc/completion (2013-04-14) 8 commits

  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-14 at 56c08ff)
 + doc: clarify that "git daemon --user=<user>" option does not export HOME=~user

 Will merge to 'master'.


* fc/send-email-annotate (2013-04-14) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-14 at 4af1076)
 + rebase-am: explicitly disable cover-letter
 + format-patch: trivial cleanups
 + format-patch: add format.coverLetter configuration variable
 + log: update to OPT_BOOL
 + format-patch: refactor branch name calculation
 + format-patch: improve head calculation for cover-letter
 + send-email: make annotate configurable

 Allows format-patch --cover-letter to be configurable; the most
 notable is the "auto" mode to create cover-letter only for multi
 patch series.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* fc/remote-hg (2013-04-11) 21 commits
 - remote-hg: activate graphlog extension for hg_log()
 - remote-hg: fix bad file paths
 - remote-hg: document location of stored hg repository

 Rerolled.

 Waiting for comments.


* jk/http-dumb-namespaces (2013-04-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-15 at 4bfa834)
 + http-backend: respect GIT_NAMESPACE with dumb clients

 Allow smart-capable HTTP servers to be restricted via the
 GIT_NAMESPACE mechanism when talking with commit-walker clients
 (they already do so when talking with smart HTTP clients).

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jl/submodule-mv (2013-04-11) 4 commits
 - rm: delete .gitmodules entry of submodules removed from the work tree
 - Teach mv to update the path entry in .gitmodules for moved submodules
 - Teach mv to move submodules using a gitfile
 - Teach mv to move submodules together with their work trees

 "git mv A B" when moving a submodule A does "the right thing",
 inclusing relocating its working tree and adjusting the paths in
 the .gitmodules file.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jc/detached-head-doc (2013-04-05) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-14 at 24b9271)
 + glossary: extend "detached HEAD" description

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/merge-tree-added-identically (2013-04-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-15 at 35fd4b9)
 + merge-tree: don't print entries that match "local"

 The resolution of some corner cases by "git merge-tree" were
 inconsistent between top-of-the-tree and in a subdirectory.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jn/add-2.0-u-A-sans-pathspec (2013-04-03) 6 commits
 - git add: -u/-A now affects the entire working tree
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-05 at eae93ef)
 + add -A: only show pathless 'add -A' warning when changes exist outside cwd
 + add -u: only show pathless 'add -u' warning when changes exist outside cwd
 + add: make warn_pathless_add() a no-op after first call
 + add: add a blank line at the end of pathless 'add [-u|-A]' warning
 + add: make pathless 'add [-u|-A]' warning a file-global function

 "git add -u/-A" without any pathspec traditionally limited its
 operation to the current directory when run from a subdirectory,
 but in Git 2.0, they will affect the entire working tree.  Start
 training users to explicitly say "." or ":/" to smooth out the
 transition hump with the earlier parts of this series, and flip the
 default as the final step.

 Will merge to 'master' the early bits and cook the rest in 'next' until Git 2.0.


* tr/packed-object-info-wo-recursion (2013-03-27) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-29 at b1c3858)
 + sha1_file: remove recursion in unpack_entry
 + Refactor parts of in_delta_base_cache/cache_or_unpack_entry
 + sha1_file: remove recursion in packed_object_info

 Attempts to reduce the stack footprint of sha1_object_info()
 and unpack_entry() codepaths.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 . pathspec: i18n-ize error strings in pathspec parsing code
 . Move struct pathspec and related functions to pathspec.[ch]
 . clean: remove unused variable "seen"
 . setup.c: check that the pathspec magic ends with ")"

 Migrate the rest of codebase to use "struct pathspec" more.


* jc/add-2.0-delete-default (2013-03-08) 3 commits
 - git add <pathspec>... defaults to "-A"
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-05 at 199442e)
 + git add: start preparing for "git add <pathspec>..." to default to "-A"
 + builtin/add.c: simplify boolean variables

 In Git 2.0, "git add pathspec" will mean "git add -A pathspec".  If
 you did this in a working tree that tracks dir/lost and dir/another:

 $ rm dir/lost
 $ edit dir/another
 $ git add dir

 The last step will not only notices and records updated
 dir/another, but also notices and records the removal of dir/lost
 in the index.

 Start training the users for this change to say --no-all when they
 want to ignore the removal to smooth the transition hump.

 Will merge to 'master' the early bits and cook the rest in 'next' until Git 2.0.


* tr/line-log (2013-04-12) 11 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-15 at 504559e)
 + log -L: improve comments in process_all_files()
 + log -L: store the path instead of a diff_filespec
 + log -L: test merge of parallel modify/rename
 + t4211: pass -M to 'git log -M -L...' test
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-05 at 5afb00c)
 + log -L: fix overlapping input ranges
 + log -L: check range set invariants when we look it up
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-01 at 5be920c)
 + Speed up log -L... -M
 + log -L: :pattern:file syntax to find by funcname
 + Implement line-history search (git log -L)
 + Export rewrite_parents() for 'log -L'
 + Refactor parse_loc


* jc/push-2.0-default-to-simple (2013-04-03) 13 commits
 - push: switch default from "matching" to "simple"
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-05 at 1b42c19)
 + t5570: do not assume the "matching" push is the default
 + t5551: do not assume the "matching" push is the default
 + t5550: do not assume the "matching" push is the default
 + t9401: do not assume the "matching" push is the default
 + t9400: do not assume the "matching" push is the default
 + t7406: do not assume the "matching" push is the default
 + t5531: do not assume the "matching" push is the default
 + t5519: do not assume the "matching" push is the default
 + t5517: do not assume the "matching" push is the default
 + t5516: do not assume the "matching" push is the default
 + t5505: do not assume the "matching" push is the default
 + t5404: do not assume the "matching" push is the default

 Update the test suite that still assumed the push.default will
 forever be 'matching'.  In Git 2.0, that will no longer be the
 case.

 Will merge to 'master' the early bits and cook the rest in 'next' until Git 2.0.

  (merged to 'next' on 2013-04-05 at f4e50e8)
 + count-objects: output "KiB" instead of "kilobytes"

 The command reports the total diskspace used to store loose objects
 in kibibytes, but it was labelled as "kilobytes".  The number now
 is shown with "KiB", e.g. "6750 objects, 50928 KiB".

 If you have scripts that decide when to run "git repack" by parsing
 the output from "git count-objects", this release may break them.
 Sorry about that.  One of the scripts shipped by git-core itself
 also had to be adjusted.  You may want to consider updating such
 scripts to always call "git gc --auto" to let it decide when to
 repack for you.

 Discarded.

 + dir.c: git-status: avoid is_excluded checks for tracked files
 + dir.c: replace is_path_excluded with now equivalent is_excluded API
 + dir.c: unify is_excluded and is_path_excluded APIs
 + dir.c: move prep_exclude and factor out parts of last_exclude_matching
 + dir.c: git-status --ignored: don't list empty directories as ignored
 + dir.c: git-status --ignored: don't list empty ignored directories
 + dir.c: git-status --ignored: don't list files in ignored directories
 + dir.c: git-status --ignored: don't drop ignored directories

 "git status --ignored" had many corner case bugs.  Also the command
 has been optimized by taking advantage of the fact that paths that
 are already known to the index do not have to be checked against
 the .gitignore mechanism most of the time.

 Discarded.
