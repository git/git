What's cooking in git.git (Aug 2008, #05; Tue, 19)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed
with '-' are only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are
in 'next'.

The topics list the commits in reverse chronological order.  The topics
meant to be merged to the maintenance series have "maint-" in their names.

Tonight's 'pu' does not pass tests because test vectors have not been
adjusted for the changes brought in by the jc/diff-prefix topic.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* js/mingw-stat (Mon Aug 18 22:01:06 2008 +0200) 2 commits
 - Revert "Windows: Use a customized struct stat that also has the
   st_blocks member."
 - compat: introduce on_disk_bytes()

This gets rid of use of st_blocks member (which is XSI but not POSIX
proper), which was originally prompted by recent Haiku port but it turns
out MinGW has the same issue as well.  Queued on 'pu' just to have a
chance to make sure I munged the version j6t sent me correctly before
merging it upwards.

* ml/submodule-foreach (Sun Aug 10 19:10:04 2008 -0400) 1 commit

 + Teach git log --exit-code to return an appropriate exit code
 + Teach git log --check to return an appropriate exit code

 + Fix commit_tree() buffer leak

* pb/reflog-dwim (Sun Aug 10 22:22:21 2008 +0200) 1 commit
 + builtin-reflog: Allow reflog expire to name partial ref

* jc/send-pack-tell-me-more (Thu Mar 20 00:44:11 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 - "git push": tellme-more protocol extension

* jc/merge-whitespace (Sun Feb 24 23:29:36 2008 -0800) 1 commit
 - WIP: start teaching the --whitespace=fix to merge machinery

* lw/gitweb (Mon Aug 18 21:39:49 2008 +0200) 3 commits
 - gitweb: use new Git::Repo API, and add optional caching
 - add new Perl API: Git::Repo, Git::Commit, Git::Tag, and
   Git::RepoRoot
 - gitweb: add test suite with Test::WWW::Mechanize::CGI

* jc/diff-prefix (Mon Aug 18 20:08:09 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 - diff: vary default prefix depending on what are compared

* jc/blame (Wed Jun 4 22:58:40 2008 -0700) 2 commits
 - blame: show "previous" information in --porcelain/--incremental
   format
 - git-blame: refactor code to emit "porcelain format" output

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* ak/p4 (Thu Aug 14 23:40:39 2008 +0100) 14 commits
 + Utilise our new p4_read_pipe and p4_write_pipe wrappers
 + Add p4 read_pipe and write_pipe wrappers
 + Put in the two other configuration elements found in the source
 + Put some documentation in about the parameters that have been
   added
 + Move git-p4.syncFromOrigin into a configuration parameters section
 + Consistently use 'git-p4' for the configuration entries
 + If the user has configured various parameters, use them.
 + Switch to using 'p4_build_cmd'
 + If we are in verbose mode, output what we are about to run (or
   return)
 + Add a single command that will be used to construct the 'p4'
   command
 + Utilise the new 'p4_system' function.
 + Have a command that specifically invokes 'p4' (via system)
 + Utilise the new 'p4_read_pipe_lines' command
 + Create a specific version of the read_pipe_lines command for p4
   invocations

Warmly received by the primary contributors of git-p4; this was merged as
part of 1.6.0.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Will merge to master soon]

* js/checkout-dwim-local (Sat Aug 9 16:00:12 2008 +0200) 1 commit
 + checkout --track: make up a sensible branch name if '-b' was
   omitted

* bd/diff-strbuf (Wed Aug 13 23:18:22 2008 -0700) 3 commits
 + xdiff-interface: hide the whole "xdiff_emit_state" business from
   the caller
 + Use strbuf for struct xdiff_emit_state's remainder
 + Make xdi_diff_outf interface for running xdiff_outf diffs

Gives measurable performance improvement to textual diff generation.  For
improving "blame" performance, it might be more effective to hook directly
to lower level of xdiff machinery so that we do not even have to generate
patch only to discard after reading "@@ -l,k +m,n @@" lines, but that
would be a separate topic.

* jc/add-stop-at-symlink (Mon Aug 4 00:52:37 2008 -0700) 2 commits
 + add: refuse to add working tree items beyond symlinks
 + update-index: refuse to add working tree items beyond symlinks

Fix for a longstanding bug that allows "git add" and "git update-index" to
add a path "a/b" to the index when "a" is a symbolic link.  We would need
a similar fix for the case where "a" is a submodule.

* dp/hash-literally (Sun Aug 3 18:36:22 2008 +0400) 6 commits
 + add --no-filters option to git hash-object
 + add --path option to git hash-object
 + use parse_options() in git hash-object
 + correct usage help string for git-hash-object
 + correct argument checking test for git hash-object
 + teach index_fd to work with pipes

Gives a bit more flexibility to hash-objects by allowing us to lie about
the path the contents comes from.

* mv/merge-custom (Wed Aug 13 23:32:43 2008 +0200) 7 commits
 + Update .gitignore to ignore git-help
 + Builtin git-help.
 + builtin-help: always load_command_list() in cmd_help()
 + Add a second testcase for handling invalid strategies in git-merge
 + Add a new test for using a custom merge strategy
 + builtin-merge: allow using a custom strategy
 + builtin-help: make some internal functions available to other
   builtins

* kh/diff-tree (Sun Aug 10 18:13:04 2008 +0200) 4 commits
 + Add test for diff-tree --stdin with two trees
 + Teach git diff-tree --stdin to diff trees
 + diff-tree: Note that the commit ID is printed with --stdin
 + Refactoring: Split up diff_tree_stdin

* mg/count-objects (Fri Aug 15 00:20:20 2008 -0400) 1 commit
 + count-objects: Add total pack size to verbose output

This one is without the human readable bits.

* mz/push-verbose (Sat Aug 16 19:58:32 2008 +0200) 1 commit
 + Make push more verbose about illegal combination of options

* jc/index-extended-flags (Sat Aug 16 23:02:08 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 + index: future proof for "extended" index entries

* cc/merge-base-many (Sun Jul 27 13:47:22 2008 -0700) 4 commits
 + git-merge-octopus: use (merge-base A (merge B C D E...)) for
   stepwise merge
 + merge-base-many: add trivial tests based on the documentation
 + documentation: merge-base: explain "git merge-base" with more than
   2 args
 + merge-base: teach "git merge-base" to drive underlying
   merge_bases_many()

* rs/imap (Wed Jul 9 22:29:02 2008 +0100) 5 commits
 + Documentation: Improve documentation for git-imap-send(1)
 + imap-send.c: more style fixes
 + imap-send.c: style fixes
 + git-imap-send: Support SSL
 + git-imap-send: Allow the program to be run from subdirectories of
   a git tree

Some people seem to prefer having this feature available also with gnutls.
Such an enhancement can be done in-tree on top of this series if they are
so inclined.

* jc/add-addremove (Tue Jul 22 22:30:40 2008 -0700) 2 commits
 + builtin-add.c: optimize -A option and "git add ."
 + builtin-add.c: restructure the code for maintainability

* jk/pager-swap (Tue Jul 22 03:14:12 2008 -0400) 2 commits
 + spawn pager via run_command interface
 + run-command: add pre-exec callback

This changes the parent-child relationship between the pager and the git
process.  We used to make pager the parent which meant that the exit
status from git is lost from the caller.

* ph/enable-threaded (Mon Jul 21 11:23:43 2008 +0200) 1 commit
 + Enable threaded delta search on *BSD and Linux.

* am/cherry-pick-rerere (Sun Aug 10 17:18:55 2008 +0530) 1 commit
 + Make cherry-pick use rerere for conflict resolution.

* js/parallel-test (Mon Aug 18 12:25:40 2008 -0400) 4 commits
 + Update t/.gitignore to ignore all trash directories
 + Enable parallel tests
 + tests: Clarify dependencies between tests, 'aggregate-results' and
   'clean'
 + t9700: remove useless check

* jc/test-deeper (Fri Aug 8 02:26:28 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 + tests: use $TEST_DIRECTORY to refer to the t/ directory

This does not actually move "t/test directory" any deeper, but fixes test
scripts that assume they run immediately below "t/" to use TEST_DIRECTORY
variable.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Actively Cooking]

* sp/missing-thin-base (Tue Aug 12 11:31:06 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 + pack-objects: Allow missing base objects when creating thin packs

* tr/filter-branch (Tue Aug 12 10:45:59 2008 +0200) 3 commits
 + filter-branch: use --simplify-merges
 + filter-branch: fix ref rewriting with --subdirectory-filter
 + filter-branch: Extend test to show rewriting bug

Fixes a longstanding filter branch bug.

* jc/post-simplify (Fri Aug 15 01:34:51 2008 -0700) 8 commits
 - revision --simplify-merges: incremental simplification
 - revision --simplify-merges: prepare for incremental simplification
 - revision --simplify-merges: make it a no-op without pathspec
 + revision --simplify-merges: do not leave commits unprocessed
 + revision --simplify-merges: use decoration instead of commit->util
   field
 + Topo-sort before --simplify-merges
 + revision traversal: show full history with merge simplification
 + revision.c: whitespace fix

"log --full-history" is with too much clutter, "log" itself is too cleverer
than some people, and here is the middle level of merge simplification.

I started making this incremental but the progress is not so great.

* tr/rev-list-docs (Tue Aug 12 01:55:37 2008 +0200) 1 commit
 + Documentation: rev-list-options: move --simplify-merges
   documentation

----------------------------------------------------------------
[On Hold]

* lt/time-reject-fractional-seconds (Sat Aug 16 21:25:40 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 - date/time: do not get confused by fractional seconds

Linus hints further enhancements as "the right way", so let's see if
somebody else steps up and tries it before merging this to 'next'.

* jc/cc-ld-dynpath (Sat Aug 16 15:01:23 2008 +0200) 2 commits
 - configure: auto detect dynamic library path switches
 - Makefile: Allow CC_LD_DYNPATH to be overriden

Needs success reports from people who do use user-defined dynamic library
path when they build their "git" before this series can go anywhere.

* sb/daemon (Thu Aug 14 20:02:20 2008 +0200) 4 commits
 - git-daemon: rewrite kindergarden, new option --max-connections
 - git-daemon: Simplify dead-children reaping logic
 - git-daemon: use LOG_PID, simplify logging code
 - git-daemon: call logerror() instead of error()

Can somebody who actually runs the daemon standalone comment on this one?

* mv/merge-recursive (Tue Aug 12 22:14:00 2008 +0200) 3 commits
 - Make builtin-revert.c use merge_recursive_generic()
 - merge-recursive.c: Add more generic merge_recursive_generic()
 - Split out merge_recursive() to merge-recursive.c

I do not think builtlin-revert should use "recursive", but these patches
give a good starting point to separate the bulk of the "rename-aware
three-way merge" into library form.

* sp/smart-http (Sun Aug 3 00:25:17 2008 -0700) 2 commits
 - [do not merge -- original version] Add Git-aware CGI for Git-aware
   smart HTTP transport
 - Add backdoor options to receive-pack for use in Git-aware CGI

The "magic" detection protocol was revised to use POST to info/refs; the
top one queued is from before that discussion.

* cc/bisect (Fri Jul 25 05:36:37 2008 +0200) 2 commits
 - bisect: only check merge bases when needed
 - bisect: test merge base if good rev is not an ancestor of bad rev

The first one alone does not pass its self-test but combined together they
seem to.  It does not build confidence as the latter one is supposed to be
an optimization only.  Resend of fixed-up series is needed.

* sg/merge-options (Sun Apr 6 03:23:47 2008 +0200) 1 commit
 + merge: remove deprecated summary and diffstat options and config
   variables

This was previously in "will be in master soon" category, but it turns out
that the synonyms to the ones this one deletes are fairly new invention
that happend in 1.5.6 timeframe, and we cannot do this just yet.  Perhaps
in 1.7.0.

* jc/dashless (Wed Jun 25 15:55:11 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 - Make clients ask for "git program" over ssh and local transport

This is the "botched" one.  Will be resurrected during 1.7.0 or 1.8.0
timeframe.

* jk/renamelimit (Sat May 3 13:58:42 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 - diff: enable "too large a rename" warning when -M/-C is explicitly
   asked for

This would be the right thing to do for command line use, but gitk will be
hit due to tcl/tk's limitation, so I am holding this back for now.
