What's cooking in git.git (Jan 2021, #01; Wed, 6)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'seen' (formerly 'pu'---proposed updates) while commits prefixed
with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

https://github.com/git/git/runs/1660876025 shows that with a few
topics excluded the tip of 'seen' passes the CI.  Yay.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

Release tarballs are available at:

[New Topics]

* ab/branch-sort (2021-01-06) 5 commits
 - branch: show "HEAD detached" first under reverse sort
 - branch: use the "detached_head_first" sorting option
 - ref-filter: add a "detached_head_first" sorting option
 - branch tests: add to --sort tests
 - branch: change "--local" to "--list" in comment

 The implementation of "git branch --sort" wrt the detached HEAD
 display has always been hacky, which has been cleaned up.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ab/coc-update-to-2.0 (2021-01-04) 3 commits
 - CoC: update to version 2.0 + local changes
 - CoC: explicitly take any whitespace breakage
 - CoC: Update word-wrapping to match upstream

 Update the Code-of-conduct to version 2.0 from the upstream (we've
 been using version 1.4).

 The first step needs to be signed off by the author, and like the
 original discussion thread back in Sep 2019, it also needs to
 collect acks from list regulars to show support.

 - refs: allow @{n} to work with n-sized reflog
 - refs: factor out set_read_ref_cutoffs()

 After expiring a reflog and making a single commit, the reflog for
 the branch would record a single entry that knows both @{0} and
 @{1}, but we failed to answer "what commit we was on?", i.e. @{1}

 "git for-each-repo --config=<var> <cmd>" should not run <cmd> for
 any repository when the configuration variable <var> is not defined
 even once.

 Code clean-up.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* mt/t4129-with-setgid-dir (2021-01-06) 1 commit
 - t4129: don't fail if setgid is set in the test directory

 Some tests expect that "ls -l" output has either '-' or 'x' for
 group executable bit, but setgid bit can be inherited from parent
 directory and make these fields 'S' or 's' instead, causing test
 failures.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* nk/perf-fsmonitor-cleanup (2021-01-06) 1 commit

* mt/grep-sparse-checkout (2020-12-06) 10 commits
 - t7817: do not depend on any specific default branch name
 - config: add setting to ignore sparsity patterns in some cmds
 - grep: honor sparse checkout patterns
 - config: correctly read worktree configs in submodules
 - config: make do_git_config_sequence receive a 'struct repository'

 (this branch is used by mt/rm-sparse-checkout.)

 "git grep" has been tweaked to be limited to the sparse checkout
 paths.


* mt/rm-sparse-checkout (2020-12-08) 1 commit
 - rm: honor sparse checkout patterns
 (this branch uses mt/grep-sparse-checkout.)

 "git rm" follows suit to "git grep" to ignore paths outside the
 sparsity pattern when the sparse checkout feature is in use.

 Need to wait for how these fit in larger picture.

* jk/symlinked-dotgitx-files (2020-10-23) 9 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-10-26 at c1dd37b024)
 + docs: document symlink restrictions for .git* files
 + fsck: complain when .gitattributes or .gitignore is a symlink
 + verify_path(): disallow symlinks in .gitattributes and .gitignore
 + t0060: test obscured .gitattributes and .gitignore matching
 + t7450: test .gitmodules symlink matching against obscured names
 + t7450: test verify_path() handling of gitmodules
 + t7415: rename to expand scope
 + fsck_tree(): wrap some long lines
 + fsck_tree(): fix shadowed variable

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2020-10-23

 "git fsck" and the corresponding check done during the transport
 learned to ensure that in-tree files like `.gitignore` and
 `.gitattributes` are not symbolic links.

 It seems that there are real projects with .gitignore recorded as
 symlinks, which may need to loosen the fsck setting.  Do we need to
 introduce a class that is separate from symlinked .gitmodules that
 probably is with potential consequences that is more/less grave?

 Will eject out of 'next' when rewinding the branch.


* sm/curl-retry (2020-10-13) 3 commits
 - http: automatically retry some requests
 - replace CURLOPT_FILE With CURLOPT_WRITEDATA
 - remote-curl: add testing for intelligent retry for HTTP

 The http transport has been taught to retry a failed request that
 may reasonably be retried.

 Expecting a reroll.

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

 - t6600-test-reach: generalize *_three_modes
 - commit-graph: consolidate fill_commit_graph_info
 - revision: parse parent in indegree_walk_step()
 - commit-graph: fix regression when computing Bloom filters

 The commit-graph learned to use corrected commit dates instead of
 the generation number to help topological revision traversal.

 Getting there.


* es/perf-export-fix (2020-12-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-12-22 at d06b0379d9)

 . mergetool: break setup_tool out into separate initialization function
 . mergetool: add per-tool support for the autoMerge flag
 . mergetool: alphabetize the mergetool config docs
 . mergetool: add automerge configuration

 "git mergetool" feeds three versions (base, local and remote) of
 a conflicted path unmodified.  The command learned to optionally
 prepare these files with unconflicted parts already resolved.

 Breaks tests on macOS.
 cf. https://github.com/git/git/runs/1659807735?check_suite_focus=true#step:4:1641


* ew/decline-core-abbrev (2020-12-23) 1 commit

  (merged to 'next' on 2020-12-22 at 9eaae4f5c0)
 + worktree: teach `repair` to fix multi-directional breakage

 "git worktree repair" learned to deal with the case where both the
 repository and the worktree moved.

 Will merge to 'master'.

* jt/clone-unborn-head (2020-12-22) 3 commits
 - clone: respect remote unborn HEAD
 - connect, transport: add no-op arg for future patch
 - ls-refs: report unborn targets of symrefs

 "git clone" tries to locally check out the branch pointed at by
 HEAD of the remote repository after it is done, but the protocol
 did not convey the information necessary to do so when copying an
 empty repository.  The protocol v2 learned how to do so.

 - pack-redundant: gauge the usage before proposing its removal

 Warn loudly when the "pack-redundant" command, which has been left
 stale with almost unusable performance issues, gets used, as we no
 longer want to recommend its use (instead just "repack -d" instead).


* en/merge-ort-recursive (2020-12-16) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-12-22 at 0dbf60011f)
 + merge-ort: implement merge_incore_recursive()
 + merge-ort: make clear_internal_opts() aware of partial clearing
 + merge-ort: copy a few small helper functions from merge-recursive.c
 + commit: move reverse_commit_list() from merge-recursive
 (this branch uses en/merge-ort-2 and en/merge-ort-impl; is tangled with en/merge-ort-3 and en/ort-conflict-handling.)

 The ORT merge strategy learned to synthesize virtual ancestor tree
 by recursively merging multiple merge bases together, just like the
 recursive backend has done for years.

 Will merge to 'master'.

* fc/pull-merge-rebase (2020-12-15) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-12-21 at acce13e5c4)
 + pull: display default warning only when non-ff
 + pull: correct condition to trigger non-ff advice
 + pull: get rid of unnecessary global variable
 + pull: give the advice for choosing rebase/merge much later
 + pull: refactor fast-forward check

 When a user does not tell "git pull" to use rebase or merge, the
 command gives a loud message telling a user to choose between
 rebase or merge but creates a merge anyway, forcing users who would
 want to rebase to redo the operation.  Fix an early part of this
 problem by tightening the condition to give the message---there is
 no reason to stop or force the user to choose between rebase or
 merge if the history fast-forwards.

* sj/untracked-files-in-submodule-directory-is-not-dirty (2020-12-08) 1 commit
 - diff: do not show submodule with untracked files as "-dirty"

 "git diff" showed a submodule working tree with untracked cruft as
 "Submodule commit <objectname>-dirty", but a natural expectation is
 that the "-dirty" indicator would align with "git describe --dirty",
 which does not consider having untracked files in the working tree
 as source of dirtiness.  The inconsistency has been fixed.
