X-master-at: 142430338477d9d1bb25be66267225fb58498d92

What's cooking in git.git (Mar 2021, #07; Mon, 22)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'seen' (formerly 'pu'---proposed updates) while commits prefixed
with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

The tip of the 'next' has been rewound and rebuilt from the tip of
'master'.  Matheus's parallel checkout (part 1) topic has been
ejected from 'next' to be replaced with a new iteration when it
comes.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

Release tarballs are available at:

* ab/remote-write-config-in-camel-case (2021-02-24) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-03-01 at a01bd0d8e4)

 Update C code that sets a few configuration variables when a remote
 is configured so that it spells configuration variable names in the
 canonical camelCase.


* bc/clone-bare-with-conflicting-config (2021-03-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-03-14 at 963a86199c)
 + builtin/init-db: handle bare clones when core.bare set to false

 "git -c core.bare=false clone --bare ..." would have segfaulted,
 which has been corrected.


* dl/cat-file-doc-cleanup (2021-03-03) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-03-13 at f1a216175a)
 + git-cat-file.txt: remove references to "sha1"
 + git-cat-file.txt: monospace args, placeholders and filenames

 Doc cleanup.


* dl/stash-show-untracked (2021-03-05) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-03-08 at 510d4cfa5f)
 + stash show: learn stash.showIncludeUntracked
 + stash show: teach --include-untracked and --only-untracked

 "git stash show" learned to optionally show untracked part of the
 stash.


* ds/commit-graph-generation-config (2021-02-25) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-03-01 at 926537ea97)
 + commit-graph: use config to specify generation type
 + commit-graph: create local repository pointer

 A new configuration variable has been introduced to allow choosing
 which version of the generation number gets used in the
 commit-graph file.


* en/ort-perf-batch-8 (2021-02-26) 10 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-03-07 at f03b2c1acd)
 + diffcore-rename: compute dir_rename_guess from dir_rename_counts
 + diffcore-rename: limit dir_rename_counts computation to relevant dirs

 + diffcore-rename: add function for clearing dir_rename_count
 + Move computation of dir_rename_count from merge-ort to diffcore-rename
 + diffcore-rename: add a mapping of destination names to their indices
 + diffcore-rename: provide basic implementation of idx_possible_rename()
 + diffcore-rename: use directory rename guided basename comparisons
 (this branch is used by en/ort-perf-batch-10, en/ort-perf-batch-9 and en/ort-readiness.)

 Rename detection rework continues.


* jk/filter-branch-sha256 (2021-03-10) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-03-14 at e4e624590a)
 + filter-branch: drop $_x40 glob
 + filter-branch: drop multiple-ancestor warning
 + t7003: test ref rewriting explicitly

 Code clean-up.
 In the longer term, we might want to remove filter-branch and nudge
 folks to more modern tools.


* jk/open-dotgitx-with-nofollow (2021-02-16) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-25 at a784bf7be6)
 + mailmap: do not respect symlinks for in-tree .mailmap
 + exclude: do not respect symlinks for in-tree .gitignore
 + attr: do not respect symlinks for in-tree .gitattributes
 + exclude: add flags parameter to add_patterns()
 + attr: convert "macro_ok" into a flags field
 + add open_nofollow() helper

 It does not make sense to make ".gitattributes", ".gitignore" and
 ".mailmap" symlinks, as they are supposed to be usable from the
 object store (think: bare repositories where HEAD:.mailmap etc. are
 used).  When these files are symbolic links, we used to read the
 contents of the files pointed by them by mistake, which has been
 corrected.


* jk/perf-in-worktrees (2021-02-26) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-03-02 at ea298cb298)
 + t/perf: avoid copying worktree files from test repo

 + doc: .gitignore documentation typofix

 Doc cleanup.


* mt/cleanly-die-upon-missing-required-filter (2021-02-26) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-03-01 at 357954af7c)
 + convert: fail gracefully upon missing clean cmd on required filter

 We had a code to diagnose and die cleanly when a required
 clean/smudge filter is missing, but an assert before that
 unnecessarily fired, hiding the end-user facing die() message.


* ps/update-ref-trans-hook-doc (2021-03-01) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-03-14 at 41c418967d)
 + githooks.txt: clarify documentation on reference-transaction hook
 + githooks.txt: replace mentions of SHA-1 specific properties

 Doc update.


* rr/mailmap-entry-self (2021-03-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-03-13 at 9f98a99713)
 + Add entry for Ramkumar Ramachandra

 Will merge to 'master'.

  (merged to 'next' on 2021-03-01 at bee9248828)

 + t4205: assert %(describe) test coverage
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-25 at 2347ed8fe6)

 Test cleanup.

 - diff --no-index tests: test mode normalization
 - diff --no-index tests: add test for --exit-code

 More test coverage over "diff --no-index".

 Will merge to 'next'.


* cs/http-use-basic-after-failed-negotiate (2021-03-22) 1 commit
 - remote-curl: fall back to basic auth if Negotiate fails

 When accessing a server with a URL like https://user:pass@site/, we
 did not to fall back to the basic authentication with the
 credential material embedded in the URL after the "Negotiate"
 authentication failed.  Now we do.

 Will merge to 'next'.

  (merged to 'next' on 2021-03-22 at efbda3a7ce)
 + t: annotate !PTHREADS tests with !FAIL_PREREQS

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2021-03-19

 GIT_TEST_FAIL_PREREQS is a mechanism to skip test pieces with
 prerequisites to catch broken tests that depend on the side effects
 of optional pieces, but did not work at all when negative
 prerequisites were involved.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* mt/add-rm-in-sparse-checkout (2021-03-18) 7 commits

 "git add" and "git rm" learned not to touch those paths that are
 outside of sparse checkout.

 Expecting a reroll.
 cf. <xmqqlfajnn6w.fsf@gitster.g>


* mt/checkout-remove-nofollow (2021-03-18) 2 commits
 - checkout: don't follow symlinks when removing entries
 - symlinks: update comment on threaded_check_leading_path()

 When "git checkout" removes a path that does not exist in the
 commit it is checking out, it wasn't careful enough not to follow
 symbolic links, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 - parallel-checkout: add design documentation
 - parallel-checkout: support progress displaying

 "git diff-index" codepath has been taught to trust fsmonitor status
 to reduce number of lstat() calls.

 Will merge to 'master'.

  (merged to 'next' on 2021-03-22 at 0df16bc9b3)
 + http: drop the check for an empty proxy password before approving

 "git commit --fixup=<commit>", which was to tweak the changes made
 to the contents while keeping the original log message intact,
 learned "--fixup=(amend|reword):<commit>", that can be used to
 tweak both the message and the contents, and only the message,
 respectively.

 "git repack" so far has been only capable of repacking everything
 under the sun into a single pack (or split by size).  A cleverer
 strategy to reduce the cost of repacking a repository has been
 introduced.

 "git fsck" and the corresponding check done during the transport
 learned to ensure that in-tree files like `.gitignore` and
 `.gitattributes` are not symbolic links.

 It seems that there are real projects with .gitignore recorded as
 symlinks, which may need to loosen the fsck setting.  Do we need to
 introduce a class that is separate from symlinked .gitmodules that
 has potential consequences that is more/less grave, so that these
 projects can opt out of the new checks?

 Code clean-up.

 I am not exactly sure where this series wants to go, other than
 unnecessarily churning the code.  Seems to break "diff --no-index"
 rather badly, too (e.g. t4050, t4002, among others).
