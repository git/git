What's cooking in git.git (Aug 2017, #05; Tue, 22)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

The second batch of topics are in.  This cycle is going a bit slower
than the previous one (as of mid-week #3 of this cycle, we have
about 200 patches on 'master' since v2.14, compared to about 300
patches in the cycle towards v2.14 at a similar point in the cycle),
but hopefully we can catch up eventually.  

I am planning to be offline most of the next week, by the way.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

* ab/ref-filter-no-contains (2017-08-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-18 at 7ec9d3d3a2)
 + tests: don't give unportable ">" to "test" built-in, use -gt

 A test fix.


* bw/clone-recursive-quiet (2017-08-04) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-14 at fbd4473ce4)
 + clone: teach recursive clones to respect -q

 "git clone --recurse-submodules --quiet" did not pass the quiet
 option down to submodules.


* bw/grep-recurse-submodules (2017-08-02) 10 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-14 at dcfcfc94af)

 (this branch is used by bw/submodule-config-cleanup.)

 "git grep --recurse-submodules" has been reworked to give a more
 consistent output across submodule boundary (and do its thing
 without having to fork a separate process).

  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-14 at 421dc09fd0)

 "git push --recurse-submodules $there HEAD:$target" was not
 propagated down to the submodules, but now it is.

 The "ref-store" code reorganization continues.


* pw/am-signoff (2017-08-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-18 at 7678ed822c)
 + am: fix signoff when other trailers are present

 "git am -s" has been taught that some input may end with a trailer
 block that is not Signed-off-by: and it should refrain from adding
 an extra blank line before adding a new sign-off in such a case.


* pw/sequence-rerere-autoupdate (2017-08-02) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-14 at 010cbb0cbe)

 fixed.

  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-18 at 5f879d8261)
 + strbuf: clear errno before calling getdelim(3)

 A helper function to read a single whole line into strbuf
 mistakenly triggered OOM error at EOF under certain conditions,
 which has been fixed.

 Memory leak in an error codepath has been plugged.


* sb/retire-t1200 (2017-08-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-18 at d436f9bbce)
 + t1200: remove t1200-tutorial.sh

 A test script that outlived its usefulness has been removed.


* ur/svn-local-zone (2017-08-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-18 at f222bb6db0)
 + git svn fetch: Create correct commit timestamp when using --localtime

 "git svn" used with "--localtime" option did not compute the tz
 offset for the timestamp in question and instead always used the
 current time, which has been corrected.

 Killing "git merge --edit" before the editor returns control left
 the repository in a state with MERGE_MSG but without MERGE_HEAD,
 which incorrectly tells the subsequent "git commit" that there was
 a squash merge in progress.  This has been fixed.

* cc/subprocess-handshake-missing-capabilities (2017-08-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-19 at c512710fda)
 + sub-process: print the cmd when a capability is unsupported

 When handshake with a subprocess filter notices that the process
 asked for an unknown capability, Git did not report what program
 the offending subprocess was running.  This has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.

* tb/apply-with-crlf (2017-08-19) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-22 at f92bf67061)
 + apply: file commited with CRLF should roundtrip diff and apply
 + convert: add SAFE_CRLF_KEEP_CRLF
 (this branch is tangled with jc/apply-with-crlf.)

 "git apply" that is used as a better "patch -p1" failed to apply a
 taken from a file with CRLF line endings to a file with CRLF line
 endings.  The root cause was because it misused convert_to_git()
 that tried to do "safe-crlf" processing by looking at the index
 entry at the same path, which is a nonsense---in that mode, "apply"
 is not working on the data in (or derived from) the index at all.
 This has been fixed.

 - curl: remove ifdef'd code never used with curl >=7.19.4
 - http: drop support for curl < 7.19.4
 - http: drop support for curl < 7.16.0
 - http: drop support for curl < 7.11.1

 Some code in http.c that has bitrot is being removed.

 Will be rerolled after tc/curl-with-backports stabilizes.


* tc/curl-with-backports (2017-08-11) 2 commits
 - http: use a feature check to enable GSSAPI delegation control
 - http: fix handling of missing CURLPROTO_*

 Updates to the HTTP layer we made recently unconditionally used
 features of libCurl without checking the existence of them, causing
 compilation errors, which has been fixed.  Also migrate the code to
 check feature macros, not version numbers, to cope better with
 libCurl that vendor ships with backported features.

 Will merge to 'next'.

  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-19 at faa63f8196)
 + pretty: support normalization options for %(trailers)

 + interpret-trailers: add an option to unfold values
 + interpret-trailers: add an option to show only existing trailers
 + interpret-trailers: add an option to show only the trailers

 "git interpret-trailers" has been taught a "--parse" and a few
 other options to make it easier for scripts to grab existing
 trailer lines from a commit log message.

 . zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

 Dropped, as it was rerolled for review as part of a larger series.

  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-19 at 1958f378dd)
 + rebase: turn on progress option by default for format-patch
 + format-patch: have progress option while generating patches

 "git rebase", especially when it is run by mistake and ends up
 trying to replay many changes, spent long time in silence.  The
 command has been taught to show progress report when it spends
 long time preparing these many changes to replay (which would give
 the user a chance to abort with ^C).

 Will merge to 'master'.


* mk/diff-delta-avoid-large-offset (2017-08-11) 1 commit
 . diff-delta: do not allow delta offset truncation

 The delta format used in the packfile cannot reference data at
 offset larger than what can be expressed in 4-byte, but the
 generator for the data failed to make sure the offset does not
 overflow.  This has been corrected.

 Dropped, as it was rerolled for review as part of a larger series.

 + stash: clean untracked files before reset

 "git stash -u" used the contents of the committed version of the
 ".gitignore" file to decide which paths are ignored, even when the
 file has local changes.  The command has been taught to instead use
 the locally modified contents.

  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-19 at 79b2c4b052)

 bash 4.4 or newer gave a warning on NUL byte in command
 substitution done in "git stash"; this has been squelched.

  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-19 at 2b5a25e5ae)
 + commit: skip discarding the index if there is no pre-commit hook

 "git commit" used to discard the index and re-read from the filesystem
 just in case the pre-commit hook has updated it in the middle; this
 has been optimized out when we know we do not run the pre-commit hook.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* bw/git-clang-format (2017-08-14) 2 commits
 - Makefile: add style build rule

  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-19 at cb53d7b026)

 "git merge" learned a "--signoff" option to add the Signed-off-by:
 trailer with the committer's name.

 + interpret-trailers: add options for actions

 "git interpret-trailers" learned to take the trailer specifications
 from the command line that overrides the configured values.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* sb/submodule-recursive-checkout-detach-head (2017-07-28) 2 commits
 - Documentation/checkout: clarify submodule HEADs to be detached
 - recursive submodules: detach HEAD from new state

 "git checkout --recursive" may overwrite and rewind the history of
 the branch that happens to be checked out in submodule
 repositories, which might not be desirable.  Detach the HEAD but
 still allow the recursive checkout to succeed in such a case.

 Undecided.
 This needs justification in a larger picture; it is unclear why
 this is better than rejecting recursive checkout, for example.


* ti/external-sha1dc (2017-08-16) 2 commits
 - sha1dc: allow building with the external sha1dc library
 - sha1dc: build git plumbing code more explicitly

 Platforms that ship with a separate sha1 with collision detection
 library can link to it instead of using the copy we ship as part of
 our source tree.

 Waiting for reviews.

* bw/submodule-config-cleanup (2017-08-03) 17 commits

 - unpack-trees: improve loading of .gitmodules
 - submodule-config: lazy-load a repository's .gitmodules file
 - submodule-config: move submodule-config functions to submodule-config.c
 - submodule-config: remove support for overlaying repository config
 - diff: stop allowing diff to have submodules configured in .git/config
 - submodule: remove submodule_config callback routine
 - unpack-trees: don't respect submodule.update
 - submodule: don't rely on overlayed config when setting diffopts
 - fetch: don't overlay config with submodule-config
 - submodule--helper: don't overlay config in update-clone
 - submodule--helper: don't overlay config in remote_submodule_branch
 - add, reset: ensure submodules can be added or reset
 - submodule: don't use submodule_from_name
 - t7411: check configuration parsing errors
 - Merge branch 'bc/object-id' into bw/submodule-config-cleanup
 - Merge branch 'bw/grep-recurse-submodules' into bw/submodule-config-cleanup

 Code clean-up to avoid mixing values read from the .gitmodules file
 and values read from the .git/config file.

 So, after the recent discussion around submodule.<name>.update (and
 its resolution "use submodule.<name>.active; "reset --hard" must
 ignore the .update thing"), this is now good to go, I presume?
 Please yell at me that I am clueless if that is not the case ;-)

* jc/allow-lazy-cas (2017-07-06) 1 commit
 - push: disable lazy --force-with-lease by default

 Because "git push --force-with-lease[=<ref>]" that relies on the
 stability of remote-tracking branches is unsafe when something
 fetches into the repository behind user's back, it is now disabled
 by default.  A new configuration variable can be used to enable it
 by users who know what they are doing.  This would pave the way to
 possibly turn `--force` into `--force-with-lease`.

 Will discard.
 Independent from disabling the feature by default, this stirred up
 a discussion to replace the DWIM heuristics with a better one, which
 deserves to be its own topic.

  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-14 at 24db08a6e8)
 + pathspec: die on empty strings as pathspec
 + t0027: do not use an empty string as a pathspec element

 The final step to make an empty string as a pathspec element
 illegal.  We started this by first deprecating and warning a
 pathspec that has such an element in 2.11 (Nov 2016).

 Hopefully we can merge this down to the 'master' by the end of the
 year?  A deprecation warning period that is about 1 year does not
 sound too bad.

 Will cook in 'next'.
 As the draft RelNotes says, let's merge this to 'master' after
 this release cycle.


* sd/branch-copy (2017-06-18) 3 commits
 - branch: add a --copy (-c) option to go with --move (-m)
 - branch: add test for -m renaming multiple config sections
 - config: create a function to format section headers

 "git branch" learned "-c/-C" to create and switch to a new branch
 by copying an existing one.

 I personally do not think "branch --copy master backup" while on
 "master" that switches to "backup" is a good UI, and I *will* say
 "I told you so" when users complain after we merge this down to
 'master'.


* sb/diff-color-move (2017-06-30) 26 commits

 + diff.c: readability fix
 + Merge branch 'sb/hashmap-customize-comparison' into sb/diff-color-move
 (this branch is used by jt/diff-color-move-fix.)

 "git diff" has been taught to optionally paint new lines that are
 the same as deleted lines elsewhere differently from genuinely new
 lines.

 "git gc" and friends when multiple worktrees are used off of a
 single repository did not consider the index and per-worktree refs
 of other worktrees as the root for reachability traversal, making
 objects that are in use only in other worktrees to be subject to
 garbage collection.
