What's cooking in git.git (Apr 2017, #06; Wed, 26)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

2.13-rc1 was tagged and we are now in a pre-release freeze.  The
topics marked to be merged to 'next' in the list below may be merged
to 'next' as usual, but the ones marked for 'master' may stay in
'next' until the final release, unless they are small bug/doc fixes
or hotfixes to topics that are already in -rc1 from now on.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

[Graduated to "master"]

* ab/completion-push-delete-ref (2017-04-23) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-04-23 at e227df80bf)
 + completion: expand "push --delete <remote> <ref>" for refs on that <remote>

 The completion script (in contrib/) learned to complete "git push
 --delete b<TAB>" to complete branch name to be deleted.


* ab/push-cas-doc-n-test (2017-04-19) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-04-23 at 0ef31ab624)
 + push: document & test --force-with-lease with multiple remotes

 Doc update.


* cc/split-index-config (2017-04-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-04-23 at 5996ddc3f2)
 + read-cache: avoid using git_path() in freshen_shared_index()

 The split-index code configuration code used an unsafe git_path()
 function without copying its result out.


* gb/rebase-signoff (2017-04-18) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-04-19 at c3c04e6a71)
 + rebase: pass --[no-]signoff option to git am
 + builtin/am: fold am_signoff() into am_append_signoff()
 + builtin/am: honor --signoff also when --rebasing

 "git rebase" learns "--signoff" option.


* jh/add-index-entry-optim (2017-04-19) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-04-23 at 295d4066a8)
 + read-cache: speed up has_dir_name (part 2)
 + read-cache: speed up has_dir_name (part 1)
 + read-cache: speed up add_index_entry during checkout
 + p0006-read-tree-checkout: perf test to time read-tree
 + read-cache: add strcmp_offset function

 "git checkout" that handles a lot of paths has been optimized by
 reducing the number of unnecessary checks of paths in the
 has_dir_name() function.


* jk/update-links-in-docs (2017-04-20) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-04-23 at f64249bbdf)
 + docs/bisect-lk2009: update java code conventions link
 + docs/bisect-lk2009: update nist report link
 + docs/archimport: quote sourcecontrol.net reference
 + gitcore-tutorial: update broken link
 + doc: replace or.cz gitwiki link with git.wiki.kernel.org
 + doc: use https links to avoid http redirect

 Many stale HTTP(s) links have been updated in our documentation.


* jk/war-on-git-path (2017-04-20) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-04-23 at 212e0a58ff)
 + am: drop "dir" parameter from am_state_init
 + replace strbuf_addstr(git_path()) with git_path_buf()
 + replace xstrdup(git_path(...)) with git_pathdup(...)
 + use git_path_* helper functions
 + branch: add edit_description() helper
 + bisect: add git_path_bisect_terms helper

 While handy, "git_path()" is a dangerous function to use as a
 callsite that uses it safely one day can be broken by changes
 to other code that calls it.  Reduction of its use continues.


* ls/travis-coccicheck (2017-04-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-04-23 at fa42ffe6b2)
 + travis-ci: add static analysis build job to run coccicheck

 Travis CI learns to run coccicheck.


* mh/separate-ref-cache (2017-04-16) 20 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-04-23 at bd74983456)
 + do_for_each_entry_in_dir(): delete function
 + files_pack_refs(): use reference iteration
 + commit_packed_refs(): use reference iteration
 + cache_ref_iterator_begin(): make function smarter
 + get_loose_ref_cache(): new function
 + get_loose_ref_dir(): function renamed from get_loose_refs()
 + do_for_each_entry_in_dir(): eliminate `offset` argument
 + refs: handle "refs/bisect/" in `loose_fill_ref_dir()`

 + ref-cache: rename `add_ref()` to `add_ref_entry()`
 + refs_verify_refname_available(): use function in more places
 + refs_verify_refname_available(): implement once for all backends
 + refs_ref_iterator_begin(): new function
 + refs_read_raw_ref(): new function
 + get_ref_dir(): don't call read_loose_refs() for "refs/bisect"

 The internals of the refs API around the cached refs has been
 streamlined.


* nd/conditional-config-in-early-config (2017-04-19) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-04-23 at 1803ee72a9)
 + config: correct file reading order in read_early_config()
 + config: handle conditional include when $GIT_DIR is not set up
 + config: prepare to pass more info in git_config_with_options()

 The recently introduced conditional inclusion of configuration did
 not work well when early-config mechanism was involved.


* nd/worktree-add-lock (2017-04-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-04-23 at 160b955fbb)
 + worktree add: add --lock option

 Allow to lock a worktree immediately after it's created. This helps
 prevent a race between "git worktree add; git worktree lock" and
 "git worktree prune".


* pc/t2027-git-to-pipe-cleanup (2017-04-14) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-04-23 at b5c28345a9)
 + t2027: avoid using pipes

 Having a git command on the upstream side of a pipe in a test
 script will hide the exit status from the command, which may cause
 us to fail to notice a breakage; rewrite tests in a script to avoid
 this issue.


* ps/pathspec-empty-prefix-origin (2017-04-14) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-04-23 at b91098d1f7)
 + pathspec: honor `PATHSPEC_PREFIX_ORIGIN` with empty prefix

 A recent update broke "git add -p ../foo" from a subdirectory.


* sf/putty-w-args (2017-04-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-04-23 at fdafbe6b73)

* sh/grep-tree-obj-tweak-output (2017-01-20) 2 commits
 - grep: use '/' delimiter for paths
 - grep: only add delimiter if there isn't one already

 "git grep", when fed a tree-ish as an input, shows each hit
 prefixed with "<tree-ish>:<path>:<lineno>:".  As <tree-ish> is
 almost always either a commit or a tag that points at a commit, the
 early part of the output "<tree-ish>:<path>" can be used as the
 name of the blob and given to "git show".  When <tree-ish> is a
 tree given in the extended SHA-1 syntax (e.g. "<commit>:", or
 "<commit>:<dir>"), however, this results in a string that does not
 name a blob (e.g. "<commit>::<path>" or "<commit>:<dir>:<path>").
 "git grep" has been taught to be a bit more intelligent about these
 cases and omit a colon (in the former case) or use slash (in the
 latter case) to produce "<commit>:<path>" and
 "<commit>:<dir>/<path>" that can be used as the name of a blob.

 Expecting a reroll?  Is this good enough with known limitations?


* jc/diff-b-m (2015-02-23) 5 commits
 . WIPWIP
 . WIP: diff-b-m
 - diffcore-rename: allow easier debugging
 - diffcore-rename.c: add locate_rename_src()
 - diffcore-break: allow debugging

 "git diff -B -M" produced incorrect patch when the postimage of a
 completely rewritten file is similar to the preimage of a removed
 file; such a resulting file must not be expressed as a rename from
 other place.

 The fix in this patch is broken, unfortunately.

 Will discard.

* jh/verify-index-checksum-only-in-fsck (2017-04-27) 1 commit
 - t1450: avoid use of "sed" on the index, which is a binary file

 Update an unportable constructin a new test.

 Will merge to 'next' and then to 'master'.


* dt/gc-ignore-old-gc-logs (2017-04-24) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-04-26 at 4f4cab8368)
 + test-lib: retire $remove_trash variable
 + test-lib.sh: do not barf under --debug at the end of the test
 + test-lib: abort when can't remove trash directory

 An attempt to allow us notice "fishy" situation where we fail to
 remove the temporary directory used during the test.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* nd/fopen-errors (2017-04-23) 17 commits
 - warn_failure_to_open_read_optional_path(): a new helper
 - t1308: add a test case on open a config directory
 - config.c: handle error on failing to fopen()
 - xdiff-interface.c: report errno on failure to stat() or fopen()
 - wt-status.c: report error on failure to fopen()
 - server-info: report error on failure to fopen()
 - sequencer.c: report error on failure to fopen()
 - rerere.c: report correct errno
 - rerere.c: report error on failure to fopen()
 - remote.c: report error on failure to fopen()
 - commit.c: report error on failure to fopen() the graft file
 - log: report errno on failure to fopen() a file
 - clone: use xfopen() instead of fopen()
 - blame: report error on open if graft_file is a directory
 - bisect: report on fopen() error
 - config.mak.uname: set FREAD_READS_DIRECTORIES for Linux and FreeBSD
 - git_fopen: fix a sparse 'not declared' warning

 We often try to open a file for reading whose existence is
 optional, and silently ignore errors from open/fopen; report such
 errors if they are not due to missing files.

 Expecting a reroll that would be much simplified thanks to a higher
 level helper.

* dt/raise-core-packed-git-limit (2017-04-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-04-26 at c72dd8c62f)
 + Increase core.packedGitLimit

 Raise the default packed-git limit value on larger platforms to
 avoid "git fetch" from a (recoverable) failure while "gc" is
 running in parallel.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/complete-checkout-sans-dwim-remote (2017-04-23) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-04-26 at 0c69cff69f)
 + completion: optionally disable checkout DWIM

 Completion for "git checkout <branch>" that auto-creates the branch
 out of a remote tracking branch can now be disabled, as this
 completion often gets in the way when completing to checkout an
 existing local branch that happens to share the same prefix with
 bunch of remote tracking branches.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* js/larger-timestamps (2017-04-24) 8 commits
 - use uintmax_t for timestamps
 - date.c: abort if the system time cannot handle one of our timestamps
 - timestamp_t: introduce a new data type for timestamps
 - PRItime: introduce a new "printf format" for timestamps
 - parse_timestamp(): specify explicitly where we parse timestamps
 - t0006 & t5000: skip "far in the future" test when time_t is too limited
 - t0006 & t5000: prepare for 64-bit timestamps
 - ref-filter: avoid using `unsigned long` for catch-all data type

 Some platforms have ulong that is smaller than time_t, and our
 historical use of ulong for timestamp would mean they cannot
 represent some timestamp that the platform allows.  Invent a
 separate and dedicated timestamp_t (so that we can distingiuish
 timestamps and a vanilla ulongs, which along is already a good
 move), and then declare uintmax_t is the type to be used as the
 timestamp_t

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ab/align-perf-descriptions (2017-04-23) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-04-26 at 7d66e7019e)
 + t/perf: correctly align non-ASCII descriptions in output

 Output from perf tests have been updated to align their titles.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ab/grep-pcre-v2 (2017-04-25) 20 commits

 - Makefile & configure: make PCRE v2 the default PCRE implementation
 - grep: remove support for concurrent use of both PCRE v1 & v2
 - grep: add support for PCRE v2

 - test-lib: rename the LIBPCRE prerequisite to PCRE
 - grep: make grep.patternType=[pcre|pcre1] a synonym for "perl"
 - grep & rev-list doc: stop promising libpcre for --perl-regexp
 - log: add -P as a synonym for --perl-regexp
 - log: add exhaustive tests for pattern style options & config
 - grep: add a test for backreferences in PCRE patterns
 - Makefile & configure: reword outdated comment about PCRE
 - grep: remove redundant `regflags &= ~REG_EXTENDED` assignments
 - grep: remove redundant regflags assignment under PCRE
 - grep: submodule-related case statements should die if new fields are added
 - grep: add tests for grep pattern types being passed to submodules
 - grep: amend submodule recursion test in preparation for rx engine testing

 PCRE2, which has an API different from and incompatible with PCRE,
 can now be chosen to support "grep -P -e '<pattern>'" and friends.

* jk/parse-options-no-no-no (2017-04-25) 2 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - parse-options: disallow double-negations of options starting with no-

 Command line options that begin with "--no-" (e.g. "--no-checkout"
 option of "git clone") can be negated by removing "--no-"; we
 historically also allowed prefixing an extra "no" to the option
 (e.g. "--no-no-checkout"), which made the command line look ugly
 and unusual.  This proposes to forbid it.

 While I agree there is no need to support "--no-no-checkout", this
 looks more like "if it looks ugly and unusual, you do not have to
 use it".  Perhaps we can drop it?


* df/dir-iter-remove-subtree (2017-04-19) 5 commits
 - remove_subtree(): reimplement using iterators
 - dir_iterator: rewrite state machine model
 - dir_iterator: refactor dir_iterator_advance
 - remove_subtree(): test removing nested directories
 - dir_iterator: add tests for dir_iterator API

 Update the dir-iterator API and use it to reimplement
 remove_subtree().

 A reroll exists that is based on the updated 'master', but I ran
 out of time trying to get it to work with other topics in flight
 in 'pu'.

* ab/clone-no-tags (2017-04-19) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-04-23 at c6329b0f7c)
 + clone: add a --no-tags option to clone without tags

 "git clone" learned the "--no-tags" option not to fetch all tags
 initially, and also set up the tagopt not to follow any tags in
 subsequent fetches.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* bw/forking-and-threading (2017-04-25) 13 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-04-26 at 89c495e37f)
 + run-command: restrict PATH search to executable files
 + run-command: expose is_executable function
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-04-23 at 7754b5ebc3)
 + run-command: block signals between fork and execve
 + run-command: add note about forking and threading
 + run-command: handle dup2 and close errors in child
 + run-command: eliminate calls to error handling functions in child
 + run-command: don't die in child when duping /dev/null
 + run-command: prepare child environment before forking
 + string-list: add string_list_remove function
 + run-command: use the async-signal-safe execv instead of execvp
 + run-command: prepare command before forking
 + t0061: run_command executes scripts without a #! line
 + t5550: use write_script to generate post-update hook

 The "run-command" API implementation has been made more robust
 against dead-locking in a threaded environment.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* sb/reset-recurse-submodules (2017-04-23) 4 commits
 - builtin/reset: add --recurse-submodules switch
 - submodule.c: submodule_move_head works with broken submodules
 - submodule.c: uninitialized submodules are ignored in recursive commands
 - entry.c: submodule recursing: respect force flag correctly

 "git reset" learned "--recurse-submodules" option.


* ls/travis-doc-asciidoctor (2017-04-26) 4 commits
 - travis-ci: check AsciiDoc/AsciiDoctor stderr output
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-04-19 at 359c32953b)
 + travis-ci: unset compiler for jobs that do not need one
 + travis-ci: parallelize documentation build
 + travis-ci: build documentation with AsciiDoc and Asciidoctor

 Have Travis CI format the documentation with both AsciiDoc and
 AsciiDoctor.

 Will merge to 'next' after a few CI run in 'pu'.


* mg/status-in-progress-info (2017-04-14) 1 commit
 - status: show in-progress info for short status

 "git status" learns an option to report various operations
 (e.g. "merging") that the user is in the middle of.

 Waiting for final confirmation.

* ab/grep-threading-cleanup (2017-04-16) 8 commits
 - grep: given --threads with NO_PTHREADS=YesPlease, warn
 - pack-objects: fix buggy warning about threads under NO_PTHREADS=YesPlease
 - pack-object & index-pack: add test for --threads warning under NO_PTHREADS
 - tests: add a PTHREADS prerequisite
 - grep: skip pthreads overhead when using one thread
 - grep: don't redundantly compile throwaway patterns under threading
 - grep: add tests for --threads=N and grep.threads
 - grep: assert that threading is enabled when calling grep_{lock,unlock}

 Code cleanup.

 Needs review.


* bp/sub-process-convert-filter (2017-04-23) 8 commits
 - convert: update subprocess_read_status() to not die on EOF
 - sub-process: move sub-process functions into separate files
 - convert: rename reusable sub-process functions
 - convert: update generic functions to only use generic data structures
 - convert: separate generic structures and variables from the filter specific ones
 - convert: split start_multi_file_filter into two separate functions
 - convert: move packet_write_list() into pkt-line as packet_writel()
 - pkt-line: add packet_read_line_gently()

 Code from "conversion using external process" codepath has been
 extracted to a separate sub-process.[ch] module.

 Reroll exists but needs a bit more work.

* mg/name-rev-debug (2017-03-31) 4 commits
 - describe: pass --debug down to name-rev
 - name-rev: provide debug output
 - name-rev: favor describing with tags and use committer date to tiebreak
 - name-rev: refactor logic to see if a new candidate is a better name

 "git describe --debug --contains" did not add any meaningful
 information, even though without "--contains" it did.

 Expecting a reroll of the tip two.

* ja/doc-l10n (2017-03-20) 3 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - l10n: add git-add.txt to localized man pages
 - l10n: introduce framework for localizing man pages

 A proposal to use po4a to localize our manual pages.


* nd/prune-in-worktree (2017-04-24) 12 commits
 - rev-list: expose and document --single-worktree
 - revision.c: --reflog add HEAD reflog from all worktrees
 - files-backend: make reflog iterator go through per-worktree reflog
 - revision.c: --all adds HEAD from all worktrees
 - refs: remove dead for_each_*_submodule()
 - revision.c: use refs_for_each*() instead of for_each_*_submodule()
 - refs: add refs_head_ref()
 - refs: move submodule slash stripping code to get_submodule_ref_store
 - refs.c: refactor get_submodule_ref_store(), share common free block
 - revision.c: --indexed-objects add objects from all worktrees
 - revision.c: refactor add_index_objects_to_pending()
 - revision.h: new flag in struct rev_info wrt. worktree-related refs
 (this branch uses nd/worktree-kill-parse-ref.)

 "git gc" and friends when multiple worktrees are used off of a
 single repository did not consider the index and per-worktree refs
 of other worktrees as the root for reachability traversal, making
 objects that are in use only in other worktrees to be subject to
 garbage collection.

 Expecting a reroll.
 Waiting for nd/worktree-kill-parse-ref to settle.

* nd/worktree-kill-parse-ref (2017-04-24) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-04-26 at b8e40da709)
 + refs: kill set_worktree_head_symref()
 + worktree.c: kill parse_ref() in favor of refs_resolve_ref_unsafe()

 + refs: add REFS_STORE_ALL_CAPS
 + refs.c: make submodule ref store hashmap generic
 + environment.c: fix potential segfault by get_git_common_dir()
 (this branch is used by nd/prune-in-worktree.)

 "git gc" did not interact well with "git worktree"-managed
 per-worktree refs.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/bundle (2016-03-03) 6 commits
 - index-pack: --clone-bundle option
 - Merge branch 'jc/index-pack' into jc/bundle
 - bundle v3: the beginning
 - bundle: keep a copy of bundle file name in the in-core bundle header
 - bundle: plug resource leak
 - bundle doc: 'verify' is not about verifying the bundle

 The beginning of "split bundle", which could be one of the
 ingredients to allow "git clone" traffic off of the core server
 network to CDN.
