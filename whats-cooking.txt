What's cooking in git.git (Sep 2020, #04; Wed, 16)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'seen' (formerly 'pu'---proposed updates) while commits prefixed
with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches of the
repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* kk/build-portability-fix (2020-09-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-16 at 63f2672632)
 + Fit to Plan 9's ANSI/POSIX compatibility layer

* al/ref-filter-merged-and-no-merged (2020-09-16) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-16 at b04e306660)
 + ref-filter: allow merged and no-merged filters
 + Doc: cover multiple contains/no-contains filters
 + t3201: test multiple branch filter combinations

 "git for-each-ref" and friends that list refs used to allow only
 one --merged or --no-merged to filter them; they learned to take
 combination of both kind of filtering.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* bc/faq-misc (2020-09-14) 3 commits
 - docs: explain how to deal with files that are always modified
 - docs: explain why reverts are not always applied on merge

* ar/fetch-ipversion-in-all (2020-09-15) 1 commit
 - fetch: pass --ipv4 and --ipv6 options to sub-fetches

 "git fetch --all --ipv4/--ipv6" forgot to pass the protocol options
 to instances of the "git fetch" that talk to individual remotes,
 which has been corrected.


* ar/fetch-transfer-ipversion (2020-09-16) 1 commit
 - config: option transfer.ipversion to set transport protocol version for network fetches

 Adds transfer.ipversion configuration variable.

 Needs more work.


* bc/clone-with-git-default-hash-fix (2020-09-15) 1 commit
 - builtin/clone: avoid failure with GIT_DEFAULT_HASH

 "git clone" that clones from SHA-1 repository, while
 GIT_DEFAULT_HASH set to use SHA-256 already, resulted in an
 unusable repository that half-claims to be SHA-256 repository
 with SHA-1 objects and refs.  This has been corrected.

 Expecting a reroll.

  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-16 at b0816b6eb0)

* jc/war-on-dashed-git (2020-08-27) 1 commit
 - git: catch an attempt to run "git-foo"

 The first step to remove on-disk binaries for built-in subcommands
 by soliciting objections.

 On hold for now.


* dr/push-remoteref-fix (2020-04-23) 1 commit
 - remote.c: fix handling of %(push:remoteref)

 The "%(push:remoteref)" placeholder in the "--format=" argument of
 "git format-patch" (and friends) only showed what got explicitly
 configured, not what ref at the receiving end would be updated when
 "git push" was used, as it ignored the default behaviour (e.g. update
 the same ref as the source).

 Discard for now.
 cf. <xmqqv9gu7c61.fsf@gitster.c.googlers.com>
 cf. <20200911214358.acl3hy2e763begoo@feanor>

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

 + worktree: teach `add` to recognize -d as shorthand for --detach

  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-09 at f729cb2c81)

  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-09 at abcb7515dc)

 in feature.experimental experiment.

 + submodule: use submodule repository when preparing summary

* js/no-builtins-on-disk-option (2020-08-24) 3 commits
 - ci: stop linking built-ins to the dashed versions
 - install: optionally skip linking/copying the built-ins
 - msvc: copy the correct `.pdb` files in the Makefile target `install`

 The installation procedure learned to optionally omit "git-foo"
 executable files for each 'foo' built-in subcommand, which are only
 required by old timers that still rely on the age old promise that
 prepending "git --exec-path" output to PATH early in their script
 will keep the "git-foo" calls they wrote working.

 The old attempt to remove these executables from the disk failed in
 the 1.6 era; it may be worth attempting again, but I think it is
 worth to keep this topic separate from such a policy change to help
 it graduate early.

 Expecting a reroll to update log message for the last one.
 as it confused at least two reviewers.
