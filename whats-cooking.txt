What's cooking in git.git (May 2019, #02; Tue, 14)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

An early preview 2.22-rc0 has been tagged.  Among the topics merged
to 'master' there might be some that are a bit undercooked, but
hopefully we can stabilize them quickly enough.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

[Graduated to "master"]

* cc/access-on-aix-workaround (2019-04-25) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-05-09 at 79b25b1954)
 + git-compat-util: work around for access(X_OK) under root

 Workaround for standard-compliant but less-than-useful behaviour of
 access(2) for the root user.


* dl/no-extern-in-func-decl (2019-05-05) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-05-09 at d165ac4cee)
 + *.[ch]: manually align parameter lists
 + *.[ch]: remove extern from function declarations using sed
 + *.[ch]: remove extern from function declarations using spatch

 Mechanically and systematically drop "extern" from function
 declarlation.


* dl/rev-tilde-doc-clarify (2019-05-08) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-05-09 at 6efd564b11)
 + revisions.txt: remove ambibuity between <rev>:<path> and :<path>
 + revisions.txt: mention <rev>~ form
 + revisions.txt: mark optional rev arguments with []
 + revisions.txt: change "rev" to "<rev>"

 Docfix.


* ew/repack-with-bitmaps-by-default (2019-03-18) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-05-09 at 4f8e8b01c8)
 + pack-objects: default to writing bitmap hash-cache
 + t5310: correctly remove bitmaps for jgit test
 + repack: enable bitmaps by default on bare repos

 The connectivity bitmaps are created by default in bare
 repositories now; also the pathname hash-cache is created by
 default to avoid making crappy deltas when repacking.

* jc/make-dedup-ls-files-output (2019-04-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-05-09 at e3d5825003)
 + Makefile: dedup list of files obtained from ls-files

 A "ls-files" that emulates "find" to enumerate files in the working
 tree resulted in duplicated Makefile rules that caused the build to
 issue an unnecessary warning during a trial build after merge
 conflicts are resolved in working tree *.h files but before the
 resolved results are added to the index.  This has been corrected.
 A not-so-low hanging fruit to teach ls-files to dedup either optionally
 or always has also been discussed, which probably is a good idea,
 to prevent mistakes similar to the bug this topic fixes in the future.


* jh/trace2 (2019-05-10) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-05-10 at 8b4b5564af)
 + trace2: fix up a missing "leave" entry point
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-05-09 at e1bba8aeac)
 + trace2: fix incorrect function pointer check

 A few embarrassing bugfixes.


* jh/trace2-sid-fix (2019-05-07) 11 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-05-10 at 71c39675ec)
 + trace2: fixup access problem on /etc/gitconfig in read_very_early_config
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-25 at a5c08f1226)
 + trace2: update docs to describe system/global config settings
 + trace2: make SIDs more unique
 + trace2: clarify UTC datetime formatting
 + trace2: report peak memory usage of the process
 + trace2: use system/global config for default trace2 settings
 + config: add read_very_early_config()
 + trace2: find exec-dir before trace2 initialization
 + trace2: add absolute elapsed time to start event
 + trace2: refactor setting process starting time
 + config: initialize opts structure in repo_read_config()

 Polishing of the new trace2 facility continues.  The system-level
 configuration can specify site-wide trace2 settings, which can be
 overridden with per-user configuration and environment variables.

* jk/ls-files-doc-markup-fix (2019-04-23) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-05-09 at a68fe0ae72)
 + doc/ls-files: put nested list for "-t" option into block

 Docfix.


* jk/p5302-avoid-collision-check-cost (2019-04-23) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-05-09 at 8dc92cad96)
 + p5302: create the repo in each index-pack test

 Fix index-pack perf test so that the repeated invocations always
 run in an empty repository, which emulates the initial clone
 situation better.


* jk/perf-aggregate-wo-libjson (2019-04-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-05-09 at e697c1993b)
 + t/perf: depend on perl JSON only when using --codespeed

 The script to aggregate perf result unconditionally depended on
 libjson-perl even though it did not have to, which has been
 corrected.


* js/partial-clone-connectivity-check (2019-05-05) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-05-10 at e1d3a6ebde)
 + t/perf: add perf script for partial clones
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-25 at ebd8b4bffd)
 + clone: do faster object check for partial clones

 During an initial "git clone --depth=..." partial clone, it is
 pointless to spend cycles for a large portion of the connectivity
 check that enumerates and skips promisor objects (which by
 definition is all objects fetched from the other side).  This has
 been optimized out.


* pw/clean-sequencer-state-upon-final-commit (2019-04-17) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-05-09 at cf6cce8ca7)
 + fix cherry-pick/revert status after commit
 + commit/reset: try to clean up sequencer state

 "git chery-pick" (and "revert" that shares the same runtime engine)
 that deals with multiple commits got confused when the final step
 gets stopped with a conflict and the user concluded the sequence
 with "git commit".  Attempt to fix it by cleaning up the state
 files used by these commands in such a situation.


* pw/rebase-i-internal (2019-04-19) 13 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-05-09 at 1206aa6865)
 + rebase -i: run without forking rebase--interactive
 + rebase: use a common action enum
 + rebase -i: use struct rebase_options in do_interactive_rebase()
 + rebase -i: use struct rebase_options to parse args
 + rebase -i: use struct object_id for squash_onto
 + rebase -i: use struct commit when parsing options
 + rebase -i: remove duplication
 + rebase -i: combine rebase--interactive.c with rebase.c
 + rebase: use OPT_RERERE_AUTOUPDATE()
 + rebase: rename write_basic_state()
 + rebase: don't translate trace strings
 + sequencer: always discard index after checkout
 + Merge branch 'ag/sequencer-reduce-rewriting-todo' into pw/rebase-i-internal
 (this branch is used by pw/rebase-abort-clean-rewritten.)

 The internal implementation of "git rebase -i" has been updated to
 avoid forking a separate "rebase--interactive" process.

[New Topics]

* cw/diff-highlight (2019-05-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-05-13 at 050d707166)
 + diff-highlight: use correct /dev/null for UNIX and Windows

 Portability fix for a diff-highlight tool (in contrib/).

 Will merge to 'master'.


* dl/warn-tagging-a-tag (2019-05-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-05-13 at a2f6365923)
 + tag: fix typo in nested tagging hint

 Typofix.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* js/difftool-no-index (2019-05-09) 1 commit
 - difftool --no-index: error out on --dir-diff (and don't crash)

 The "--dir-diff" mode of "git difftool" is not useful in "--no-index"
 mode; they are now explicitly marked as mutually incompatible.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* nd/submodule-helper-incomplete-line-fix (2019-05-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-05-13 at cd52f49825)
 + submodule--helper: add a missing \n

 Typofix.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* sb/format-patch-base-patch-id-fix (2019-05-08) 2 commits
 - format-patch: make --base patch-id output stable
 - format-patch: inform user that patch-id generation is unstable

 The recently added "--base" option of "format-patch" computed the
 patch-ids for prerequisite patches in an unstable way, which has
 been updated to compute in a way that is compatible with "git
 patch-id --stable".

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ab/send-email-transferencoding-fix (2019-05-13) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-05-13 at 38c6a1e7e0)
 + send-email: do defaults -> config -> getopt in that order
 + send-email: rename the @bcclist variable for consistency
 + send-email: move the read_config() function above getopts

 Since "git send-email" learned to take 'auto' as the value for the
 transfer-encoding, it by mistake stopped honoring the values given
 to the configuration variables sendemail.transferencoding and/or
 sendemail.<ident>.transferencoding.  This has been corrected to
 (finally) redoing the order of setting the default, reading the
 configuration and command line options.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ab/trace2-typofix (2019-05-13) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-05-13 at f1229d4d9d)
 + trace2: fix up a missing "leave" entry point

 Typofix.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* dl/format-patch-notes-config (2019-05-13) 2 commits
 - format-patch: teach format.notes config option
 - git-format-patch.txt: document --no-notes option

 "git format-patch" learns a configuration to set the default for
 its --notes=<ref> option.

 The interaction between config and option may be a little iffy.

* ds/midx-too-many-packs (2019-05-07) 2 commits
 - midx: add packs to packed_git linked list
 - midx: pass a repository pointer

 The code to generate the multi-pack idx file was not prepared to
 see too many packfiles and ran out of open file descriptor, which
 has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ds/trace2-document-env-vars (2019-05-13) 1 commit
 - trace2: add variable description to git.txt

 Doc update.

 - submodule: drop unused prefix parameter from some functions
 - builtin: consistently pass cmd_* prefix to parse_options
 - cmd_{read,write}_tree: rename "unused" variable that is used

 Remove many unused parameters throughout the codebase, with the
 ultimate aim to allow us compile with -Wunused-parameter cleanly.

* js/rebase-i-label-shown-in-status-fix (2019-05-13) 1 commit
 - status: fix display of rebase -ir's `label` command

 "git status" did not know that the "label" instruction in the
 todo-list "rebase -i -r" uses should not be shown as a hex object
 name.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* nd/init-relative-template-fix (2019-05-13) 1 commit
 - init: make --template path relative to $CWD

 A relative pathname given to "git init --template=<path> <repo>"
 ought to be relative to the directory "git init" gets invoked in,
 but it instead was made relative to the repository, which has been
 corrected.

* jn/unknown-index-extensions (2018-11-21) 2 commits
 - index: offer advice for unknown index extensions
 - index: do not warn about unrecognized extensions

 A bit too alarming warning given when unknown index extensions
 exist is getting revamped.

 Expecting a reroll.


* jc/format-patch-delay-message-id (2019-04-05) 1 commit
 - format-patch: move message-id and related headers to the end

 The location "git format-patch --thread" adds the Message-Id:
 header in the series of header fields has been moved down, which
 may help working around a suspected bug in GMail MSA, reported at
 <CAHk-=whP1stFZNAaJiMi5eZ9rj0MRt20Y_yHVczZPH+O01d+sA@mail.gmail.com>

* jt/fetch-cdn-offload (2019-03-12) 9 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - upload-pack: send part of packfile response as uri
 - fetch-pack: support more than one pack lockfile
 - upload-pack: refactor reading of pack-objects out
 - Documentation: add Packfile URIs design doc
 - Documentation: order protocol v2 sections
 - http-fetch: support fetching packfiles by URL
 - http: improve documentation of http_pack_request
 - http: use --stdin when getting dumb HTTP pack

 WIP for allowing a response to "git fetch" to instruct the bulk of
 the pack contents to be instead taken from elsewhere (aka CDN).

 Still being discussed.


* js/add-i-coalesce-after-editing-hunk (2018-08-28) 1 commit
 - add -p: coalesce hunks before testing applicability

 Applicability check after a patch is edited in a "git add -i/p"
 session has been improved.

 Will hold.

* js/protocol-advertise-multi (2018-12-28) 1 commit
 - protocol: advertise multiple supported versions

 The transport layer has been updated so that the protocol version
 used can be negotiated between the parties, by the initiator
 listing the protocol versions it is willing to talk, and the other
 side choosing from one of them.

 Expecting a reroll.

* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2018-10-15) 1 commit
 - zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".


* dl/remote-save-to-push (2018-12-11) 1 commit
 - remote: add --save-to-push option to git remote set-url

 "git remote set-url" learned a new option that moves existing value
 of the URL field to pushURL field of the remote before replacing
 the URL field with a new value.

 Anybody who wants to champion this topic?
 I am personally not yet quite convinced if this is worth pursuing.

 + t2018: cleanup in current test

 "git branch new A...B" and "git checkout -b new A...B" have been

 Attempt to use an abbreviated option in "git clone --recurs" is

 promisor remote and consult them in order when downloading missing
 objects on demand.

 Needs review.

 Two new commands "git switch" and "git restore" are introduced to
 split "checking out a branch to work on advancing its history" and
 "checking out paths out of the index and/or a tree-ish to work on
 advancing the current history" out of the single "git checkout"
 command.

 The "switch" part seems more or less ready for testing.  Perhaps
 we should split this back into two topics and merge it to 'next'.

* jc/format-patch-noclobber (2019-02-22) 1 commit
 - format-patch: --no-clobber refrains from overwriting output files

 "git format-patch" used to overwrite an existing patch/cover-letter
 file.  A new "--no-clobber" option stops it.

 Undecided but inclined to discard.


* am/p4-branches-excludes (2019-04-02) 8 commits
 - git-p4: respect excluded paths when detecting branches

 - git-p4: don't exclude other files with same prefix
 - git-p4: add failing test for "don't exclude other files with same prefix"

 - git-p4: add failing test for "git-p4: match branches case insensitively if configured"
 - git-p4: detect/prevent infinite loop in gitCommitByP4Change()

 "git p4" update.

 Is this ready for 'next'?


* dl/rebase-i-keep-base (2019-04-25) 6 commits
 - rebase: teach rebase --keep-base
 - rebase: fast-forward --fork-point in more cases
 - rebase: fast-forward --onto in more cases
 - rebase: refactor can_fast_forward into goto tower
 - t3432: test rebase fast-forward behavior
 - t3431: add rebase --fork-point tests

 "git rebase --keep-base <upstream>" tries to find the original base
 of the topic being rebased and rebase on top of that same base,
 which is useful when running the "git rebase -i" (and its limited
 variant "git rebase -x").

 The command also has learned to fast-forward in more cases where it
 can instead of replaying to recreate identical commits.

 On hold.

* nd/worktree-name-sanitization (2019-03-20) 2 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - worktree add: sanitize worktree names

 In recent versions of Git, per-worktree refs are exposed in
 refs/worktrees/<wtname>/ hierarchy, which means that worktree names
 must be a valid refname component.  The code now sanitizes the names
 given to worktrees, to make sure these refs are well-formed.

 I am inclined to squash the fix at the tip in and merge the result
 to 'next'.  Opinions?

 - blame: add the ability to ignore commits and their changes

 "git blame" learned to "ignore" commits in the history, whose
 effects (as well as their presence) get ignored.

 Expecting a reroll.

* nd/precious (2019-04-09) 1 commit
 . Introduce "precious" file concept

 "git clean" learned to pay attention to the 'precious' attributes
 and keep untracked paths with the attribute instead of removing
 when the "--keep-precious" is given.

 Retracted.
 cf. <CACsJy8AEZ-Lz6zgEsuNukvphB9TTa9FAC1gK05fhnie2xtfc9w@mail.gmail.com>

 I am not sure what aspect of this longer-term "precious" vision,
 which gets taught to various commands and use cases individually
 and incrementally, Ævar finds problematic, which I understand is
 the reason of redtraction.
