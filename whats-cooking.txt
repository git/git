What's cooking in git.git (Oct 2018, #04; Fri, 19)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

Two large set of topics on "rebase in C" and "rebase -i in C" are
now in 'next'.  A handful of improvements around "git help", "git
grep", and "git status" are in 'master', as well as other internal
changes.

Note that "cf. <msg-id>" are not meant as "clear all of these and
you are home free".  They are primarily to prevent me from merging
topics that are not ready to 'next' by mistake and remind me where
to go back to read the last state of the discussion in the archive.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

[Graduated to "master"]

* bp/read-cache-parallel (2018-10-11) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-12 at ed6edde799)
 + read-cache: load cache entries on worker threads
 + ieot: add Index Entry Offset Table (IEOT) extension
 + read-cache: load cache extensions on a worker thread
 + config: add new index.threads config setting
 + eoie: add End of Index Entry (EOIE) extension
 + read-cache: clean up casting and byte decoding
 + read-cache.c: optimize reading index format v4

 A new extension to the index file has been introduced, which allows
 the file to be read in parallel.


* bp/rename-test-env-var (2018-09-28) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-12 at 201e451d20)
 + t0000: do not get self-test disrupted by environment warnings
 + preload-index: update GIT_FORCE_PRELOAD_TEST support
 + read-cache: update TEST_GIT_INDEX_VERSION support
 + fsmonitor: update GIT_TEST_FSMONITOR support
 + preload-index: use git_env_bool() not getenv() for customization
 + t/README: correct spelling of "uncommon"

 Some environment variables that control the runtime options of Git
 used during tests are getting renamed for consistency.


* ds/commit-graph-leakfix (2018-10-07) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-12 at 8cc7f2f1e9)
 + commit-graph: reduce initial oid allocation
 + builtin/commit-graph.c: UNLEAK variables
 + commit-graph: clean up leaked memory during write

 Code clean-up.


* jc/how-to-document-api (2018-09-29) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-12 at 7c9bd82285)
 + CodingGuidelines: document the API in *.h files

 Doc update.


* jt/avoid-ls-refs (2018-10-07) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-12 at 5775aabbc1)
 + fetch: do not list refs if fetching only hashes
 + transport: list refs before fetch if necessary
 + transport: do not list refs if possible
 + transport: allow skipping of ref listing

 Over some transports, fetching objects with an exact commit object
 name can be done without first seeing the ref advertisements.  The
 code has been optimized to exploit this.


* jt/cache-tree-allow-missing-object-in-partial-clone (2018-10-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-12 at 152ad8e336)
 + cache-tree: skip some blob checks in partial clone

 In a partial clone that will lazily be hydrated from the
 originating repository, we generally want to avoid "does this
 object exist (locally)?" on objects that we deliberately omitted
 when we created the clone.  The cache-tree codepath (which is used
 to write a tree object out of the index) however insisted that the
 object exists, even for paths that are outside of the partial
 checkout area.  The code has been updated to avoid such a check.


* jt/fetch-tips-in-partial-clone (2018-09-21) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-12 at 521b3fb44d)
 + fetch: in partial clone, check presence of targets
 + connected: document connectivity in partial clones

 "git fetch $repo $object" in a partial clone did not correctly
 fetch the asked-for object that is referenced by an object in
 promisor packfile, which has been fixed.


* jt/non-blob-lazy-fetch (2018-10-04) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-12 at 7466c6bd7d)
 + fetch-pack: exclude blobs when lazy-fetching trees
 + fetch-pack: avoid object flags if no_dependents

 A partial clone that is configured to lazily fetch missing objects
 will on-demand issue a "git fetch" request to the originating
 repository to fill not-yet-obtained objects.  The request has been
 optimized for requesting a tree object (and not the leaf blob
 objects contained in it) by telling the originating repository that
 no blobs are needed.


* nd/complete-fetch-multiple-args (2018-09-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-10 at f78e14123c)
 + completion: support "git fetch --multiple"

 Teach bash completion that "git fetch --multiple" only takes remote
 names as arguments and no refspecs.


* nd/help-commands-verbose-by-default (2018-10-03) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-12 at 32de8f53e0)
 + help -a: improve and make --verbose default

 "git help -a" and "git help -av" give different pieces of
 information, and generally the "verbose" version is more friendly
 to the new users.  "git help -a" by default now uses the more
 verbose output (with "--no-verbose", you can go back to the
 original).  Also "git help -av" now lists aliases and external
 commands, which it did not used to.


* nd/status-refresh-progress (2018-09-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-12 at 9240c05add)
 + status: show progress bar if refreshing the index takes too long

 "git status" learns to show progress bar when refreshing the index
 takes a long time.


* nd/the-index (2018-09-21) 23 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-10 at 16e2e2e947)

 (this branch is used by sb/more-repo-in-api.)

 Various codepaths in the core-ish part learn to work on an
 arbitrary in-core index structure, not necessarily the default
 instance "the_index".


* pw/diff-color-moved-ws-fix (2018-10-04) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-12 at 73badc83fe)
 + diff --color-moved: fix a memory leak
 + diff --color-moved-ws: fix another memory leak
 + diff --color-moved-ws: fix a memory leak
 + diff --color-moved-ws: fix out of bounds string access
 + diff --color-moved-ws: fix double free crash

 Various fixes to "diff --color-moved-ws".


* rs/grep-no-recursive (2018-10-03) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-12 at 1499dc98ba)
 + grep: add -r/--[no-]recursive

 Unlike "grep", "git grep" by default recurses to the whole tree.
 The command learned "git grep --recursive" option, so that "git
 grep --no-recursive" can serve as a synonym to setting the
 max-depth to 0.


* rs/oidset-on-khash (2018-10-04) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-12 at 8bb0152b3f)
 + oidset: uninline oidset_init()
 + oidset: use khash
 + khash: factor out kh_release_*
 + fetch-pack: load tip_oids eagerly iff needed
 + fetch-pack: factor out is_unmatched_ref()

 The oidset API was built on top of the oidmap API which in turn is
 on the hashmap API.  Replace the implementation to build on top of
 the khash API and gain performance.


* sm/show-superproject-while-conflicted (2018-09-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-12 at 0334353131)
 + rev-parse: --show-superproject-working-tree should work during a merge

 A corner-case bugfix.


* ss/wt-status-committable (2018-10-03) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-10 at ea30d8819d)
 + roll wt_status_state into wt_status and populate in the collect phase
 + wt-status.c: set the committable flag in the collect phase
 + t7501: add test of "commit --dry-run --short"
 + wt-status: rename commitable to committable
 + wt-status.c: move has_unmerged earlier in the file

 Code clean-up in the internal machinery used by "git status" and
 "git commit --dry-run".


* tb/filter-alternate-refs (2018-10-09) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-12 at 21c14722f1)
 + transport.c: introduce core.alternateRefsPrefixes
 + transport.c: introduce core.alternateRefsCommand
 + transport.c: extract 'fill_alternate_refs_command'
 + transport: drop refnames from for_each_alternate_ref

 When pushing into a repository that borrows its objects from an
 alternate object store, "git receive-pack" that responds to the
 push request on the other side lists the tips of refs in the
 alternate to reduce the amount of objects transferred.  This
 sometimes is detrimental when the number of refs in the alternate
 is absurdly large, in which case the bandwidth saved in potentially
 fewer objects transferred is wasted in excessively large ref
 advertisement.  The alternate refs that are advertised are now
 configurable with a pair of configuration variables.

 "git rebase -i" learned a new insn, 'break', that the user can

 + archive: implement protocol v2 archive command
 + archive: use packet_reader for communications
 + archive: follow test standards around assertions

 The original implementation of "git archive --remote" more or less

 "git cmd --help" when "cmd" is aliased used to only say "cmd is
 aliased to ...".  Now it shows that to the standard error stream
 and runs "git $cmd --help" where $cmd is the first word of the
 alias expansion.

 This could be misleading for those who alias a command with options
 (e.g. with "[alias] cpn = cherry-pick -n", "git cpn --help" would
 show the manual of "cherry-pick", and the reader would not be told
 to pay close attention to the part that describes the "--no-commit"
 option until closing the pager that showed the contents of the
 manual, if the pager is configured to restore the original screen,
 or would not be told at all, if the pager simply makes the message
 on the standard error scroll away.

* sg/split-index-racefix (2018-10-12) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-16 at c1d6563c51)

 - sequencer: clear the number of items of a todo_list before parsing
 - Merge branch 'ag/rebase-i-in-c' into ag/sequencer-reduce-rewriting-todo
 (this branch uses ag/rebase-i-in-c; is tangled with js/rebase-i-break, js/rebase-in-c-5.5-work-with-rebase-i-in-c and pk/rebase-in-c-6-final.)

 The scripted version of "git rebase -i" wrote and rewrote the todo
 list many times during a single step of its operation, and the
 recent C-rewrite made a faithful conversion of the logic to C.  The
 implementation has been updated to carry necessary information
 around in-core to avoid rewriting the same file over and over
 unnecessarily.

 Will hold, waiting for the "rebase-in-c" and "rebase-i-in-c" topics.
