What's cooking in git.git (Feb 2010, #06; Tue, 23)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones
marked with '.' do not appear in any of the integration branches, but I am
still holding onto them.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* gb/submodule-env (2010-02-23) 2 commits
 - submodules: ensure clean environment when operating in a submodule
 - shell setup: clear_local_git_env() function

This is a round before the round with hardcoded list on the C side.  I
think the idea of the new one is basically sound, but I do not think it
should create a new source file nor call it cache.c which obviously this
thing is not (environment.c might be a better home for it).

* jl/maint-submodule-clear-env (2010-02-23) 1 commit
 - is_submodule_modified(): clear environment properly

I'd prefer to rebuild this on top of rerolled gb/submodule-env before
moving it forward.

* il/loosen-remote-helper-names (2010-02-23) 1 commit
 - Allow '+', '-' and '.' in remote helper names

Judging from the discussion, the conclusion seemed to be that Dscho was
needlessly worried about using '+' in pathnames on DOS, and the patch is
Ok.  There also was a discussion on how to sanely deal with the need to
have duplicated binaries with the current set-up, only to handle
essentially the same svn+ssh:// and ssh+svn:// protocols; I however think
that is pretty much orthogonal to the issue of what letters can be used in
names.

* jk/maint-add--interactive-delete (2010-02-22) 1 commit
 - add-interactive: fix bogus diff header line ordering

Looked Ok for 'next'.

* js/runtime-prefix-trace-not-warn (2010-02-23) 1 commit
 - Print RUNTIME_PREFIX warning only when GIT_TRACE is set

Looked Ok for 'next'.

* lt/deepen-builtin-source (2010-02-22) 1 commit
 - Move 'builtin-*' into a 'builtin/' subdirectory

This is a painful one to keep out of 'master' for a long time, as any
topic with new builtin commands will need evil merges to adjust to it.

* tc/http-cleanup (2010-02-21) 7 commits
 - remote-curl: init walker only when needed
 - remote-curl: use http_fetch_ref() instead of walker wrapper
 - http: init and cleanup separately from http-walker
 - http-walker: cleanup more thoroughly
 - http-push: remove useless condition
 - t554[01]-http-push: refactor, add non-ff tests
 - t5541-http-push: check that ref is unchanged for non-ff test

Didn't look; there was some discussion that may result in a reroll.

* tr/notes-display (2010-02-23) 11 commits
 - notes: add shorthand --ref to override GIT_NOTES_REF
 - commit --amend: copy notes to the new commit
 - rebase: support automatic notes copying
 - notes: implement helpers needed for note copying during rewrite
 - notes: implement 'git notes copy --stdin'
 - rebase -i: invoke post-rewrite hook
 - rebase: invoke post-rewrite hook
 - commit --amend: invoke post-rewrite hook
 - Documentation: document post-rewrite hook
 - Support showing notes from more than one notes tree
 - test-lib: unset GIT_NOTES_REF to stop it from influencing tests
 (this branch uses jh/notes.)

Didn't look too carefully except for the second one.

* ts/svn-mergeinfo (2010-02-22) 3 commits
 - git-svn: Fix discarding of extra parents from svn:mergeinfo
 - t9151: Add two new svn:mergeinfo test cases
 - t9151: Fix a few commits in the SVN dump

I won't pick up git-svn patches myself without Acks from Eric and/or Sam;
there are here only so that they won't be forgotten.

* cw/test-lib-relicense (2010-02-22) 1 commit
 . test-lib.sh: Add explicit license detail, with change from GPLv2 to GPLv2+.

I think a reasonable way forward would be to collect Acks from everybody
who appears on "git blame" or "git shortlog" output.  How do people feel
about relicensing the whole (except for the obviously borrowed bits, such
as xdiff/) under GPLv2 _or later_?  I am not a big fan of GPLv3 and do not
see a compelling reason to switch to v3 for the sake of v3 license per-se,
but helping others that want to use our code might tip the balance.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* ld/push-porcelain (2010-02-09) 4 commits
 - git-push: fix an error message so it goes to stderr
 - git-push: make git push --dry-run --porcelain exit with status 0 even if updates will be rejected
 - git-push: send "To <remoteurl>" messages to the standard output in --porcelain mode
 - git-push: squelch advice message if in --porcelain mode

This needs further simplification, judging from the previous discussion?

* sd/format-patch-to (2010-02-17) 1 commit
 - Add 'git format-patch --to=' option and 'format.to' configuration variable.

Shouldn't be too hard to add tests to t4014; other than that looked ready
for 'next'.

* sd/init-template (2010-02-17) 2 commits
 - Add a "TEMPLATE DIRECTORY" section to git-init[1].
 - Add `init.templatedir` configuration variable.

Shouldn't be too hard to add tests to t0001; other than that looked ready
for 'next'.

* sd/log-decorate (2010-02-17) 3 commits
 - log.decorate: usability fixes
 - Add `log.decorate' configuration variable.
 - git_config_maybe_bool()

Probably ready for 'next', except that people need to be warned about
having to update their scripts to explicitly pass --no-decorate to keep
them working.  A good idea to disable this when --pretty was given, just
like notes are disabled by default, was floated.

* pb/log-first-parent-p-m (2010-02-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-02-17 at 2f8e5ae)
 + git log -p -m: document -m and honor --first-parent

Needs tests but otherwise looked fine.  We might want to teach "-m trumps
implicit --cc" to "git show", but that is a totally separate topic.

I actually care about this "log -p --first-parent" very much, but if Pasky
is counting on that and procrastinating until I write the tests myself, he
is in for a dissapointment.  I don't have that much free time these days.
Help is appreciated.

* js/rebase-origin-x (2010-02-05) 1 commit
 - [RFC w/o test and incomplete] rebase: add -x option to record original commit name

I retract my objection against the idea of -x; needs polishing before
moving forward.

--------------------------------------------------
