What's cooking in git.git (Sep 2020, #06; Tue, 22)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'seen' (formerly 'pu'---proposed updates) while commits prefixed
with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches of the
repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

[Graduated to 'master']

* al/ref-filter-merged-and-no-merged (2020-09-18) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-18 at cc2a0039f3)
 + Doc: prefer more specific file name
 + ref-filter: make internal reachable-filter API more precise
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-16 at b04e306660)
 + ref-filter: allow merged and no-merged filters
 + Doc: cover multiple contains/no-contains filters
 + t3201: test multiple branch filter combinations

 "git for-each-ref" and friends that list refs used to allow only
 one --merged or --no-merged to filter them; they learned to take
 combination of both kind of filtering.


* ar/fetch-ipversion-in-all (2020-09-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-21 at 0da2438668)
 + fetch: pass --ipv4 and --ipv6 options to sub-fetches

 "git fetch --all --ipv4/--ipv6" forgot to pass the protocol options
 to instances of the "git fetch" that talk to individual remotes,
 which has been corrected.


* cd/commit-graph-doc (2020-09-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-16 at b0816b6eb0)
 + commit-graph-format.txt: fix no-parent value

 Doc update.


* cs/don-t-pretend-a-failed-remote-set-head-succeeded (2020-09-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-18 at 51f73ca6dc)
 + remote: don't show success message when set-head fails

 "git remote set-head" that failed still said something that hints
 the operation went through, which was misleading.


* dl/complete-format-patch-recent-features (2020-09-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-18 at c0ec1f7569)
 + contrib/completion: complete options that take refs for format-patch

 Update to command line completion (in contrib/)


* es/format-patch-interdiff-cleanup (2020-09-08) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-16 at d919bb3d1f)
 + format-patch: use 'origin' as start of current-series-range when known
 + diff-lib: tighten show_interdiff()'s interface
 + diff: move show_interdiff() from its own file to diff-lib

 "format-patch --range-diff=<prev> <origin>..HEAD" has been taught
 not to ignore <origin> when <prev> is a single version.


* hn/refs-trace-backend (2020-09-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-16 at f2e065ec17)
 + refs: add GIT_TRACE_REFS debugging mechanism

 Developer support.


* jk/dont-count-existing-objects-twice (2020-09-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-18 at 73b30558b9)
 + packfile: actually set approximate_object_count_valid

 There is a logic to estimate how many objects are in the
 repository, which is mean to run once per process invocation, but
 it ran every time the estimated value was requested.


* jt/threaded-index-pack (2020-09-08) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-16 at 8542385cc0)
 + index-pack: make quantum of work smaller
 + index-pack: make resolve_delta() assume base data
 + index-pack: calculate {ref,ofs}_{first,last} early
 + index-pack: remove redundant child field
 + index-pack: unify threaded and unthreaded code
 + index-pack: remove redundant parameter
 + Documentation: deltaBaseCacheLimit is per-thread

 "git index-pack" learned to resolve deltified objects with greater
 parallelism.


* kk/build-portability-fix (2020-09-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-16 at 63f2672632)
 + Fit to Plan 9's ANSI/POSIX compatibility layer

 Portability tweak for some shell scripts used while building.


* ls/mergetool-meld-auto-merge (2020-09-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-16 at 01985a671b)
 + mergetool: allow auto-merge for meld to follow the vim-diff behavior

 The 'meld' backend of the "git mergetool" learned to give the
 underlying 'meld' the '--auto-merge' option, which would help
 reduce the amount of text that requires manual merging.


* os/fetch-submodule-optim (2020-09-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-16 at fa39e3f211)
 + fetch: do not look for submodule changes in unchanged refs

 Optimization around submodule handling.


* pw/add-p-edit-ita-path (2020-09-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-16 at 7540ed3c0e)
 + add -p: fix editing of intent-to-add paths

 "add -p" now allows editing paths that were only added in intent.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* ld/p4-unshelve-fix (2020-09-19) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-22 at c7709a34ec)
 + git-p4: use HEAD~$n to find parent commit for unshelve
 + git-p4 unshelve: adding a commit breaks git-p4 unshelve

 The "unshelve" subcommand of "git p4" used incorrectly used
 commit^N where it meant to say commit~N to name the Nth generation
 ancestor, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* rs/archive-add-file (2020-09-19) 3 commits
 - Makefile: use git-archive --add-file
 - archive: add --add-file
 - archive: read short blobs in archive.c::write_archive_entry()

 "git archive" learns the "--add-file" option to include untracked
 files into a snapshot from a tree-ish.


* jk/diff-highlight-blank-match-fix (2020-09-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-22 at 03ac708501)
 + diff-highlight: correctly match blank lines for flush

 "diff-highlight" (in contrib/) had a logic to flush its output upon
 seeing a blank line but the way it detected a blank line was broken.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* js/default-branch-name-part-2 (2020-09-21) 5 commits
 - t9902: avoid using the branch name `master`
 - tests: avoid variations of the `master` branch name
 - t3200: avoid variations of the `master` branch name
 - fast-export: avoid using unnecessary language in a code comment
 - t/test-terminal: avoid non-inclusive language

 Update the tests to drop word 'master' from them


* jt/keep-partial-clone-filter-upon-lazy-fetch (2020-09-21) 2 commits
 - fetch: do not override partial clone filter
 - promisor-remote: remove unused variable

 The lazy fetching done internally to make missing objects available
 in a partial clone incorrectly made permanent damate to the partial
 clone filter in the repository, which has been corrected.


* rs/misc-cleanups (2020-09-19) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-22 at d034fbfab0)
 + pack-write: use hashwrite_be32() in write_idx_file()

 Code cleanup.

 Will merge to 'master'.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* vv/send-email-with-less-secure-apps-access (2020-08-29) 1 commit
 - Documentation/git-send-email.txt: Mention less secure app access might need to enable.

 Doc update.

 Expecting a reroll.
 cf. <xmqqwo1hi9nv.fsf@gitster.c.googlers.com>
 cf. <xmqqft85i72s.fsf@gitster.c.googlers.com>


* jc/war-on-dashed-git (2020-08-27) 1 commit
 - git: catch an attempt to run "git-foo"

 The first step to remove on-disk binaries for built-in subcommands
 by soliciting objections.

 On hold for now.


* dr/push-remoteref-fix (2020-04-23) 1 commit
 - remote.c: fix handling of %(push:remoteref)

 The "%(push:remoteref)" placeholder in the "--format=" argument of
 "git format-patch" (and friends) only showed what got explicitly
 configured, not what ref at the receiving end would be updated when
 "git push" was used, as it ignored the default behaviour (e.g. update
 the same ref as the source).

 Discard for now.
 cf. <xmqqv9gu7c61.fsf@gitster.c.googlers.com>
 cf. <20200911214358.acl3hy2e763begoo@feanor>


* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2018-10-15) 1 commit
 - zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* dl/diff-merge-base (2020-09-21) 10 commits
 - contrib/completion: complete `git diff --merge-base`
 - builtin/diff-tree: learn --merge-base
 - builtin/diff-index: learn --merge-base
 - t4068: add --merge-base tests
 - diff-lib: define diff_get_merge_base()
 - diff-lib: accept option flags in run_diff_index()
 - contrib/completion: extract common diff/difftool options
 - git-diff.txt: backtick quote command text
 - git-diff-index.txt: make --cached description a proper sentence
 - t4068: remove unnecessary >tmp

 "git diff A...B" learned "git diff --merge-base A B", which is a
 longer short-hand to say the same thing.


* js/ignore-cmake-build-artifacts (2020-09-17) 1 commit
 - cmake: ignore generated files

 Running CMake based build with VS (in contrib/) from the top-level
 of the working tree leaves extra build crufts behind.  Add patterns
 to .gitignore

 Expecting a resolution in a better way.
 cf. <xmqq7dsrnjhi.fsf@gitster.c.googlers.com>
 It turns out that these crufts are visible only when the CMake
 based build procedure is used against the best practice.  A better
 alternative may be to prominently describe the recommended way to
 use the CMake-based build procedure.


* hx/push-atomic-with-cert (2020-09-19) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-22 at 64561eea5b)
 + send-pack: run GPG after atomic push checking

 "git push" that wants to be atomic and wants to send push
 certificate learned not to prepare and sign the push certificate
 when it fails the local check (hence due to atomicity it is known
 that no certificate is needed).

 Will merge to 'master'.


* bc/faq-misc (2020-09-20) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-22 at a81b728010)
 + docs: explain how to deal with files that are always modified
 + docs: explain why reverts are not always applied on merge
 + docs: explain why squash merges are broken with long-running branches

 More FAQ entries.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* sb/clone-origin (2020-09-11) 4 commits
 - clone: allow configurable default for `-o`/`--origin`
 - clone: validate --origin option before use
 - clone: call git_config before parse_options
 - clone: add tests for --template and some disallowed option pairs

 "git clone" learned clone.defaultremotename configuration variable
 to customize what nickname to use to call the remote the repository
 was cloned from.

 Expecting an update.


* sk/force-if-includes (2020-09-19) 3 commits
 - t, doc: update tests, reference for "--force-if-includes"
 - push: parse and set flag for "--force-if-includes"
 - push: add reflog check for "--force-if-includes"

 "git push --force-with-lease[=<ref>]" can easily be misused to lose
 commits unless the user takes good care of their own "git fetch".
 A new option "--force-if-includes" attempts to ensure that what is
 being force-pushed was created after examining the commit at the
 tip of the remote ref that is about to be force-replaced.


* ab/mediawiki-fixes (2020-09-21) 18 commits
 - remote-mediawiki: use "sh" to eliminate unquoted commands
 - remote-mediawiki: annotate unquoted uses of run_git()
 - remote-mediawiki: convert to quoted run_git() invocation
 - remote-mediawiki: provide a list form of run_git()
 - remote-mediawiki tests: annotate failing tests
 - remote-mediawiki: fix duplicate revisions being imported
 - remote-mediawiki tests: use CLI installer
 - remote-mediawiki tests: use inline PerlIO for readability
 - remote-mediawiki tests: replace deprecated Perl construct
 - remote-mediawiki tests: use a more idiomatic dispatch table
 - remote-mediawiki tests: use "$dir/" instead of "$dir."
 - remote-mediawiki tests: change `[]` to `test`
 - remote-mediawiki tests: use test_cmp in tests
 - remote-mediawiki tests: use a 10 character password
 - remote-mediawiki tests: use the login/password variables
 - remote-mediawiki doc: don't hardcode Debian PHP versions
 - remote-mediawiki doc: link to MediaWiki's current version
 - remote-mediawiki doc: correct link to GitHub project

 Modernization and fixes to MediaWiki remote backend.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ar/fetch-transfer-ipversion (2020-09-16) 1 commit
 - config: option transfer.ipversion to set transport protocol version for network fetches

 Adds transfer.ipversion configuration variable.

 Needs more work.


* bc/clone-with-git-default-hash-fix (2020-09-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-22 at 62ea45c20e)
 + builtin/clone: avoid failure with GIT_DEFAULT_HASH

 "git clone" that clones from SHA-1 repository, while
 GIT_DEFAULT_HASH set to use SHA-256 already, resulted in an
 unusable repository that half-claims to be SHA-256 repository
 with SHA-1 objects and refs.  This has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* hn/reftable (2020-09-16) 13 commits

* bc/rev-parse-path-format (2020-09-08) 1 commit
 - rev-parse: add option for absolute or relative path formatting

 "git rev-parse" can be explicitly told to give output as absolute
 or relative path.


* ds/maintenance-part-3 (2020-09-17) 7 commits
 - maintenance: add troubleshooting guide to docs
 - maintenance: recommended schedule in register/start
 - maintenance: add start/stop subcommands
 - maintenance: add [un]register subcommands
 - for-each-repo: run subcommands on configured repos
 - maintenance: add --schedule option and config
 - maintenance: optionally skip --auto process
 (this branch uses ds/maintenance-part-1 and ds/maintenance-part-2.)

 Parts of "git maintenance" to ease writing crontab entries (and
 other scheduling system configuration) for it.


* tb/bloom-improvements (2020-09-18) 13 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-22 at 520d531ad8)
 + commit-graph: introduce 'commitGraph.maxNewFilters'
 + builtin/commit-graph.c: introduce '--max-new-filters=<n>'
 + commit-graph: rename 'split_commit_graph_opts'
 + bloom: encode out-of-bounds filters as non-empty
 + bloom/diff: properly short-circuit on max_changes
 + bloom: use provided 'struct bloom_filter_settings'

 + commit-graph: pass a 'struct repository *' in more places
 + t4216: use an '&&'-chain
 + commit-graph: introduce 'get_bloom_filter_settings()'

 "git commit-graph write" learned to limit the number of bloom
 filters that are computed from scratch with the --max-new-filters
 option.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* es/config-hooks (2020-09-09) 9 commits
 - run_commit_hook: take strvec instead of varargs
 - commit: use config-based hooks
 - hook: replace run-command.h:find_hook
 - hook: add 'run' subcommand
 - parse-options: parse into strvec
 - hook: add --porcelain to list command
 - hook: add list command
 - hook: scaffolding for git-hook subcommand
 - doc: propose hooks managed by the config

 The "hooks defined in config" topic.


* mt/grep-sparse-checkout (2020-09-10) 9 commits
 - config: add setting to ignore sparsity patterns in some cmds
 - grep: honor sparse checkout patterns
 - config: correctly read worktree configs in submodules

 paths.


* ew/decline-core-abbrev (2020-09-01) 1 commit
 - core.abbrev <off|false|no> disables abbreviations

 Allow the configuration to specify no abbreviation regardless of
 the hash algorithm.

 Expecting a reroll.  The intent is very good.

 - bisect--helper: retire `--bisect-autostart` subcommand
 - bisect--helper: retire `--write-terms` subcommand

 Rewrite of the "git bisect" script in C continues.

 At v7; getting close
 cf. <nycvar.QRO.7.76.6.2009031403510.56@tvgsbejvaqbjf.bet>


* js/no-builtins-on-disk-option (2020-09-21) 3 commits
 - ci: stop linking built-ins to the dashed versions
 - Optionally skip linking/copying the built-ins
 - msvc: copy the correct `.pdb` files in the Makefile target `install`

 The installation procedure learned to optionally omit "git-foo"
 executable files for each 'foo' built-in subcommand, which are only
 required by old timers that still rely on the age old promise that
 prepending "git --exec-path" output to PATH early in their script
 will keep the "git-foo" calls they wrote working.

 The old attempt to remove these executables from the disk failed in
 the 1.6 era; it may be worth attempting again, but I think it is
 worth to keep this topic separate from such a policy change to help
 it graduate early.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/refspecs-negative (2020-09-18) 2 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - refspec: add support for negative refspecs

 "negative refspecs"

 Expecting a reroll.
 cf. <nycvar.QRO.7.76.6.2008221528170.56@tvgsbejvaqbjf.bet>
 cf. <xmqqzh5onea1.fsf@gitster.c.googlers.com>


* jx/proc-receive-hook (2020-08-27) 10 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-18 at 344c89be7e)
 + doc: add documentation for the proc-receive hook
 + transport: parse report options for tracking refs
 + t5411: test updates of remote-tracking branches
 + receive-pack: new config receive.procReceiveRefs
 + doc: add document for capability report-status-v2
 + New capability "report-status-v2" for git-push
 + receive-pack: feed report options to post-receive
 + receive-pack: add new proc-receive hook
 + t5411: add basic test cases for proc-receive hook
 + transport: not report a non-head push as a branch

 "git receive-pack" that accepts requests by "git push" learned to
 outsource most of the ref updates to the new "proc-receive" hook.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ds/maintenance-part-2 (2020-09-17) 8 commits
 - maintenance: add incremental-repack auto condition

 - midx: use start_delayed_progress()
 - midx: enable core.multiPackIndex by default
 - maintenance: create auto condition for loose-objects
 - maintenance: add loose-objects task

 (this branch is used by ds/maintenance-part-3; uses ds/maintenance-part-1.)

 "git maintenance", an extended big brother of "git gc", continues
 to evolve.


* ds/maintenance-part-1 (2020-09-17) 11 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-18 at 4c367d3cf6)

 (this branch is used by ds/maintenance-part-2 and ds/maintenance-part-3.)

 A "git gc"'s big brother has been introduced to take care of more
 repository maintenance tasks, not limited to the object database
 cleaning.

 Will merge to 'master'.
