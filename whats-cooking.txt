What's cooking in git.git (Jun 2024, #07; Thu, 20)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and
aren't considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL
to a message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity (of course they can be resubmit when new interests
arise).

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-scm/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/

  (merged to 'next' on 2024-06-20 at 01d4bdd019)
 + merge: avoid write merge state when unable to write index

 When "git merge" sees that the index cannot be refreshed (e.g. due
 to another process doing the same in the background), it died but
 after writing MERGE_HEAD etc. files, which was useless for the
 purpose to recover from the failure.

 + macOS: ls-files path fails if path of workdir is NFD

 We forgot to normalize the result of getcwd() to NFC on macOS where
 all other paths are normalized, which has been corrected.  This still
 does not address the case where core.precomposeUnicode configuration
 is not defined globally.

 Will merge to 'master'.
