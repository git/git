What's cooking in git.git (Nov 2018, #06; Wed, 21)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* ab/dynamic-gettext-poison (2018-11-09) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-18 at 13247a3be6)
 + Makefile: ease dynamic-gettext-poison transition
 + i18n: make GETTEXT_POISON a runtime option

 Our testing framework uses a special i18n "poisoned localization"
 feature to find messages that ought to stay constant but are
 incorrectly marked to be translated.  This feature has been made
 into a runtime option (it used to be a compile-time option).


* ab/range-diff-no-patch (2018-11-14) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-17 at c42e0891d0)
 + range-diff: make diff option behavior (e.g. --stat) consistent
 + range-diff: fix regression in passing along diff options
 + range-diff doc: add a section about output stability

 The "--no-patch" option, which can be used to get a high-level
 overview without the actual line-by-line patch difference shown, of
 the "range-diff" command was earlier broken, which has been
 corrected.


* ab/rebase-in-c-escape-hatch (2018-11-16) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-17 at a01be221c7)
 + tests: add a special setup where rebase.useBuiltin is off
 + rebase doc: document rebase.useBuiltin

 The recently merged "rebase in C" has an escape hatch to use the
 scripted version when necessary, but it hasn't been documented,
 which has been corrected.


* ag/p3400-force-checkout (2018-11-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-17 at 87ff48d52a)
 + p3400: replace calls to `git checkout -b' by `git checkout -B'

 Perf test tweak.


* cb/notes-freeing-always-null-fix (2018-11-13) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-17 at 47aeec5fc9)
 + builtin/notes: remove unnecessary free

 Code cleanup.


* dd/poll-dot-h (2018-11-14) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-18 at b6745f3308)
 + git-compat-util: prefer poll.h to sys/poll.h

 A build update.


* ds/push-squelch-ambig-warning (2018-11-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-18 at 5e8b3db129)
 + pack-objects: ignore ambiguous object warnings

 "git push" used to check ambiguities between object-names and
 refnames while processing the list of refs' old and new values,
 which was unnecessary (as it knew that it is feeding raw object
 names).  This has been optimized out.


* ds/reachable-topo-order (2018-11-02) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-13 at 4155d01aee)
 + t6012: make rev-list tests more interesting
 + revision.c: generation-based topo-order algorithm
 + commit/revisions: bookkeeping before refactoring
 + revision.c: begin refactoring --topo-order logic
 + test-reach: add rev-list tests
 + test-reach: add run_three_modes method
 + prio-queue: add 'peek' operation

 The revision walker machinery learned to take advantage of the
 commit generation numbers stored in the commit-graph file.


* jk/close-duped-fd-before-unlock-for-bundle (2018-11-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-17 at 2fe598284e)
 + bundle: dup() output descriptor closer to point-of-use

 When "git bundle" aborts due to an empty commit ranges
 (i.e. resulting in an empty pack), it left a file descriptor to an
 lockfile open, which resulted in leftover lockfile on Windows where
 you cannot remove a file with an open file descriptor.  This has
 been corrected.


* jk/curl-ldflags (2018-11-05) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-13 at d1387a3aa0)
 + build: link with curl-defined linker flags

 The way -lcurl library gets linked has been simplified by taking
 advantage of the fact that we can just ask curl-config command how.


* jk/unused-parameter-fixes (2018-11-06) 14 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-13 at 8d3625b4ae)
 + midx: double-check large object write loop
 + assert NOARG/NONEG behavior of parse-options callbacks
 + parse-options: drop OPT_DATE()
 + apply: return -1 from option callback instead of calling exit(1)
 + cat-file: report an error on multiple --batch options
 + tag: mark "--message" option with NONEG
 + show-branch: mark --reflog option as NONEG
 + format-patch: mark "--no-numbered" option with NONEG
 + status: mark --find-renames option with NONEG
 + cat-file: mark batch options with NONEG
 + pack-objects: mark index-version option as NONEG
 + ls-files: mark exclude options as NONEG
 + am: handle --no-patch-format option
 + apply: mark include/exclude options as NONEG

 Various functions have been audited for "-Wunused-parameter" warnings
 and bugs in them got fixed.


* jk/verify-sig-merge-into-void (2018-11-07) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-13 at a207be60ed)
 + pull: handle --verify-signatures for unborn branch
 + merge: handle --verify-signatures for unborn branch
 + merge: extract verify_merge_signature() helper

 "git merge" and "git pull" that merges into an unborn branch used
 to completely ignore "--verify-signatures", which has been
 corrected.


* js/apply-recount-allow-noop (2018-11-13) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-17 at e413fa105f)
 + apply --recount: allow "no-op hunks"

 When editing a patch in a "git add -i" session, a hunk could be
 made to no-op.  The "git apply" program used to reject a patch with
 such a no-op hunk to catch user mistakes, but it is now updated to
 explicitly allow a no-op hunk in an edited patch.


* js/builtin-rebase-perf-fix (2018-11-13) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-17 at 9e9db8c8e1)
 + built-in rebase: reinstate `checkout -q` behavior where appropriate
 + rebase: prepare reset_head() for more flags
 + rebase: consolidate clean-up code before leaving reset_head()

 Code clean-up with correction to make the reimplemented "git
 rebase" a more faithful rewrite of the original, which also regains
 performance.


* js/config-sequence (2018-11-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-17 at fefca0bbe8)
 + config: report a bug if git_dir exists without commondir

 A sanity check for start-up sequence has been added in the config
 API codepath.


* js/fuzz-cxxflags (2018-11-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-17 at 5e589a5237)
 + Makefile: use FUZZ_CXXFLAGS for linking fuzzers

 The build procedure to link for fuzzing test has been made
 customizable with a new Makefile variable.


* js/mailmap (2018-11-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-17 at 673bfc4cfa)
 + Update .mailmap

 Update the mailmap to unify multiple entries for the authors with
 commits since v2.10.


* js/mingw-create-hard-link (2018-11-14) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-17 at 27f866db16)
 + mingw: use `CreateHardLink()` directly

 Windows update.


* js/mingw-msdn-url (2018-11-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-17 at a6a9afddbf)
 + mingw: replace an obsolete link with the superseding one

 The URL to an MSDN page in a comment has been updated.


* js/mingw-res-rebuild (2018-11-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-13 at fb736827d1)
 + Windows: force-recompile git.res for differing architectures

 Windows build update.


* js/rebase-am-options (2018-11-16) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-17 at f956d9b948)
 + rebase: validate -C<n> and --whitespace=<mode> parameters early
 + rebase: really just passthru the `git am` options

 The way "git rebase" parses and forwards the command line options
 meant for underlying "git am" has been revamped, which fixed for
 options with parameters that were not passed correctly.


* js/rebase-autostash-detach-fix (2018-11-08) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-17 at 15957b4a5a)
 + built-in rebase --autostash: leave the current branch alone if possible
 + built-in rebase: demonstrate regression with --autostash

 "git rebase --autostash" did not correctly re-attach the HEAD at times.


* js/rebase-r-and-merge-head (2018-11-13) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-17 at 6bb27df7b1)
 + status: rebase and merge can be in progress at the same time
 + built-in rebase --skip/--abort: clean up stale .git/<name> files
 + rebase -i: include MERGE_HEAD into files to clean up
 + rebase -r: do not write MERGE_HEAD unless needed
 + rebase -r: demonstrate bug with conflicting merges

 Bugfix for the recently graduated "git rebase --rebase-merges".


* js/test-git-installed (2018-11-16) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-18 at 61474ba19e)
 + tests: explicitly use `git.exe` on Windows
 + tests: do not require Git to be built when testing an installed Git
 + t/lib-gettext: test installed git-sh-i18n if GIT_TEST_INSTALLED is set
 + tests: respect GIT_TEST_INSTALLED when initializing repositories
 + tests: fix GIT_TEST_INSTALLED's PATH to include t/helper/

 Update the "test installed Git" mode of our test suite to work better.


* lj/mingw-pthread-cond (2018-11-14) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-17 at 46abe4100d)
 + win32: replace pthread_cond_*() with much simpler code

 Code simplification.


* mg/gpg-fingerprint-test (2018-11-05) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-13 at 71f11020c4)
 + t/t7510-signed-commit.sh: add signing subkey to Eris Discordia key
 + t/t7510-signed-commit.sh: Add %GP to custom format checks

 Add a few tests for a topic already in 'master'.


* nd/command-list-gen-fix (2018-11-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-17 at a6ff6baa0b)
 + build: fix broken command-list.h generation with core.autocrlf

 Build tweak.

  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-17 at 09306064d5)
 + doc: move extensions.worktreeConfig to the right place

 Doc update.


* nd/format-patch-cover-letter-stat-width (2018-11-13) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-18 at 65a464977d)
 + format-patch: respect --stat in cover letter's diffstat

 "git format-patch --stat=<width>" can be used to specify the width
 used by the diffstat (shown in the cover letter).


* nd/pthreads (2018-11-05) 14 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-13 at bb6914b3f8)
 + Clean up pthread_create() error handling

 + grep: remove #ifdef NO_PTHREADS
 + attr.c: remove #ifdef NO_PTHREADS
 + name-hash.c: remove #ifdef NO_PTHREADS
 + index-pack: remove #ifdef NO_PTHREADS
 + send-pack.c: move async's #ifdef NO_PTHREADS back to run-command.c
 + run-command.h: include thread-utils.h instead of pthread.h
 + thread-utils: macros to unconditionally compile pthreads API

 The codebase has been cleaned up to reduce "#ifndef NO_PTHREADS".


* ra/rev-parse-exclude-glob (2018-11-13) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-17 at 396dd7a2c2)
 + refs: fix some exclude patterns being ignored
 + refs: show --exclude failure with --branches/tags/remotes=glob

 "rev-parse --exclude=<pattern> --branches=<pattern>" etc. did not
 quite work, which has been corrected.


* sb/cocci-pending (2018-11-14) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-18 at dd271722d3)
 + coccicheck: introduce 'pending' semantic patches

 A coding convention around the Coccinelle semantic patches to have
 two classes to ease code migration process has been proposed and
 its support has been added to the Makefile.


* sg/ref-filter-wo-repository (2018-11-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-17 at c0bec63990)
 + ref-filter: don't look for objects when outside of a repository

 "git ls-remote --sort=<thing>" can feed an object that is not yet
 available into the comparison machinery and segfault, which has
 been corrected to check such a request upfront and reject it.


* tb/print-size-t-with-uintmax-format (2018-11-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-18 at 752e51c7ed)
 + Upcast size_t variables to uintmax_t when printing

 Code preparation to replace ulong vars with size_t vars where
 appropriate.


* tb/xcurl-off-t (2018-11-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-18 at ac2a4bc14a)
 + remote-curl.c: xcurl_off_t is not portable (on 32 bit platfoms)

 The xcurl_off_t() helper function is used to cast size_t to
 curl_off_t, but some compilers gave warnings against the code to
 ensure the casting is done without wraparound, when size_t is
 narrower than curl_off_t.  This warning has been squelched.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* dl/merge-cleanup-scissors-fix (2018-11-21) 2 commits
 - merge: add scissors line on merge conflict
 - t7600: clean up 'merge --squash c3 with c7' test

 The list of conflicted paths shown in the editor while concluding a
 conflicted merge was shown above the scissors line when the
 clean-up mode is set to "scissors", even though it was commented
 out just like the list of updated paths and other information to
 help the user explain the merge better.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* aw/pretty-trailers (2018-11-19) 5 commits
 - pretty: add support for separator option in %(trailers)
 - strbuf: separate callback for strbuf_expand:ing literals
 - pretty: add support for "valueonly" option in %(trailers)
 - pretty: allow showing specific trailers
 - pretty: single return path in %(trailers) handling

 The %(trailers) formatter in "git log --format=..."  now allows to
 optionally pick trailers selectively by keyword, show only values,
 etc.


* nd/attr-pathspec-in-tree-walk (2018-11-19) 5 commits
 - tree-walk: support :(attr) matching
 - dir.c: move, rename and export match_attrs()
 - pathspec.h: clean up "extern" in function declarations
 - tree-walk.c: make tree_entry_interesting() take an index
 - tree.c: make read_tree*() take 'struct repository *'

 The traversal over tree objects has learned to honor
 ":(attr:label)" pathspec match, which has been implemented only for
 enumerating paths on the filesystem.


* ab/commit-graph-progress-fix (2018-11-20) 1 commit
 - commit-graph: split up close_reachable() progress output


* sg/test-BUG (2018-11-20) 1 commit
 - tests: send "bug in the test script" errors to the script's stderr

 test framework has been updated to make a bug in the test script
 (as opposed to bugs in Git that are discovered by running the
 tests) stand out more prominently.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sg/test-cmp-rev (2018-11-20) 1 commit
 - test-lib-functions: make 'test_cmp_rev' more informative on failure

 Test framework update.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ss/msvc-strcasecmp (2018-11-20) 1 commit
 - msvc: directly use MS version (_stricmp) of strcasecmp

 MSVC update.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* cc/delta-islands (2018-11-21) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-21 at 3bac399f83)
 + pack-objects: fix off-by-one in delta-island tree-depth computation
 + pack-objects: zero-initialize tree_depth/layer arrays
 + pack-objects: fix tree_depth and layer invariants

 A few issues in the implementation of "delta-islands" feature has
 been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jn/eoie-ieot (2018-11-21) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-21 at 9eb98a38f0)
 + index: make index.threads=true enable ieot and eoie
 + ieot: default to not writing IEOT section
 + eoie: default to not writing EOIE section
 (this branch is used by jn/unknown-index-extensions.)

 As the warning message shown by existing versions of Git for
 unknown index extensions is a bit too alarming, two new extensions
 are held back and not written by default for the upcoming release.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jn/unknown-index-extensions (2018-11-21) 2 commits
 - index: offer advice for unknown index extensions
 - index: do not warn about unrecognized extensions
 (this branch uses jn/eoie-ieot.)

 A bit too alarming warning given when unknown index extensions
 exist is getting revamped.

 Expecting a reroll.


* js/builtin-rebase-perf-fix-err-fix (2018-11-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-21 at 9c351cfc4a)
 + rebase: warn about the correct tree's OID

 The object name of the tree reported in a recently added error
 message was wrong, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* js/rebase-am-options-fix (2018-11-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-21 at 4da85e17c2)
 + legacy-rebase: backport -C<n> and --whitespace=<option> checks

 Recently, built-in "rebase" tightened the error checking for a few
 options that are passed to underlying "am", but we forgot to make
 the matching change to the scripted version, which has been
 corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* nd/clone-case-smashing-warning (2018-11-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-21 at 68bc7959f8)
 + clone: fix colliding file detection on APFS

 Recently added check for case smashing filesystems did not
 correctly utilize the cached stat information, leading to false
 breakage detected by our test suite, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* tz/build-tech-midx-doc (2018-11-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-21 at 15dd462db0)
 + Documentation: build technical/multi-pack-index

 A documentation page that is referred to by other pages was not
 built by mistake, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.

* lt/date-human (2018-07-09) 1 commit
 - Add 'human' date format

 A new date format "--date=human" that morphs its output depending
 on how far the time is from the current time has been introduced.
 "--date=auto" can be used to use this new format when the output is
 goint to the pager or to the terminal and otherwise the default
 format.

* ab/push-example-in-doc (2018-11-14) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-18 at 8fd935a19c)
 + push: change needlessly ambiguous example in error

 An error message that sugggests how to give correct arguments to
 "git push" has been updated.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* en/fast-export-import (2018-11-17) 11 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-18 at 87bbbffc95)
 + fast-export: add a --show-original-ids option to show original names
 + fast-import: remove unmaintained duplicate documentation
 + fast-export: add --reference-excluded-parents option
 + fast-export: ensure we export requested refs
 + fast-export: when using paths, avoid corrupt stream with non-existent mark
 + fast-export: move commit rewriting logic into a function for reuse
 + fast-export: avoid dying when filtering by paths and old tags exist
 + fast-export: use value from correct enum
 + git-fast-export.txt: clarify misleading documentation about rev-list args
 + git-fast-import.txt: fix documentation for --quiet option
 + fast-export: convert sha1 to oid

 Small fixes and features for fast-export and fast-import, mostly on
 the fast-export side.

* nd/checkout-dwim-fix (2018-11-14) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-18 at 3d714e7719)
 + checkout: disambiguate dwim tracking branches and local files

 "git checkout frotz" (without any double-dash) avoids ambiguity by
 making sure 'frotz' cannot be interpreted as a revision and as a
 path at the same time.  This safety has been updated to check also
 a unique remote-tracking branch 'frotz' in a remote, when dwimming
 to create a local branch 'frotz' out of a remote-tracking branch
 'frotz' from a remote.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* nd/checkout-noisy (2018-11-20) 2 commits
 - t0027: squelch checkout path run outside test_expect_* block
 - checkout: print something when checking out paths

 "git checkout [<tree-ish>] path..." learned to report the number of
 paths that have been checked out of the index or the tree-ish,
 which gives it the same degree of noisy-ness as the case in which
 the command checks out a branch.


* sg/clone-initial-fetch-configuration (2018-11-16) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-18 at cae0f3985b)
 + Documentation/clone: document ignored configuration variables
 + clone: respect additional configured fetch refspecs during initial fetch
 + clone: use a more appropriate variable name for the default refspec

 Refspecs configured with "git -c var=val clone" did not propagate
 to the resulting repository, which has been corrected.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* cc/shared-index-permbits (2018-11-19) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-19 at 79df716844)
 + read-cache: make the split index obey umask settings

 The way .git/index and .git/sharedindex* files were initially
 created gave these files different perm bits until they were
 adjusted for shared repository settings.  This was made consistent.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* en/rebase-merge-on-sequencer (2018-11-08) 2 commits
 - rebase: implement --merge via git-rebase--interactive
 - git-rebase, sequencer: extend --quiet option for the interactive machinery

 "git rebase --merge" as been reimplemented by reusing the internal
 machinery used for "git rebase -i".


* fc/http-version (2018-11-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-18 at 42f5155095)
 + http: add support selecting http version

 The "http.version" configuration variable can be used with recent
 enough cURL library to force the version of HTTP used to talk when
 fetching and pushing.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* dl/remote-save-to-push (2018-11-13) 1 commit
 - remote: add --save-to-push option to git remote set-url

 "git remote set-url" learned a new option that moves existing value
 of the URL field to pushURL field of the remote before replacing
 the URL field with a new value.


* jk/loose-object-cache (2018-11-13) 9 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-18 at 276691a21b)
 + fetch-pack: drop custom loose object cache
 + sha1-file: use loose object cache for quick existence check
 + object-store: provide helpers for loose_objects_cache
 + sha1-file: use an object_directory for the main object dir
 + handle alternates paths the same as the main object dir
 + sha1_file_name(): overwrite buffer instead of appending
 + rename "alternate_object_database" to "object_directory"
 + submodule--helper: prefer strip_suffix() to ends_with()
 + fsck: do not reuse child_process structs

 Code clean-up with optimization for the codepath that checks
 (non-)existence of loose objects.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* js/protocol-advertise-multi (2018-11-17) 1 commit
 - protocol: advertise multiple supported versions

 The transport layer has been updated so that the protocol version
 used can be negotiated between the parties, by the initiator
 listing the protocol versions it is willing to talk, and the other
 side choosing from one of them.


* js/smart-http-detect-remote-error (2018-11-17) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-18 at 5c6edfcb85)
 + remote-curl: die on server-side errors
 + remote-curl: tighten "version 2" check for smart-http
 + remote-curl: refactor smart-http discovery

 Some errors from the other side coming over smart HTTP transport
 were not noticed, which has been corrected.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* nb/branch-show-other-worktrees-head (2018-11-12) 2 commits
 - branch: mark and colorize a branch differently if it is checked out in a linked worktree
 - ref-filter: add worktree atom

 "git branch --list" learned to show branches that are checked out
 in other worktrees connected to the same repository prefixed with
 '+', similar to the way the currently checked out branch is shown
 with '*' in front.

 Expecting a reroll.

  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-18 at 36567023be)
 + push doc: document the DWYM behavior pushing to unqualified <dst>
 + push: test that <src> doesn't DWYM if <dst> is unqualified
 + push: add an advice on unqualified <dst> push
 + push: move unqualified refname error into a function
 + push: improve the error shown on unqualified <dst> push
 + i18n: remote.c: mark error(...) messages for translation
 + remote.c: add braces in anticipation of a follow-up change

 "git push $there $src:$dst" rejects when $dst is not a fully
 qualified refname and not clear what the end user meant.  The
 codepath has been taught to give a clearer error message, and also
 guess where the push should go by taking the type of the pushed
 object into account (e.g. a tag object would want to go under
 refs/tags/).

* md/list-lazy-objects-fix (2018-10-29) 1 commit
 - list-objects.c: don't segfault for missing cmdline objects

 "git rev-list --exclude-promissor-objects" had to take an object
 that does not exist locally (and is lazily available) from the
 command line without barfing, but the code dereferenced NULL.

 That sympotom may be worth addressing, but I think the "fix" is
 overly broad and is wrong.  Giving a missing object should be
 diagnosed as an error, not swept under the rug silently.

 Prepare to run test suite on Azure DevOps.

 Ejected out of 'pu', as doing so seems to help other topics get
 tested at TravisCI.

 https://travis-ci.org/git/git/builds/452713184 is a sample of a
 build whose tests on 4 hang (with this series in).  Ejecting it
 gave us https://travis-ci.org/git/git/builds/452778963 which still
 shows breakages from other topics not yet in 'next', but at least
 the tests do not stall.

 . sequencer: refactor transform_todos() to work on a todo_list
 . sequencer: make the todo_list structure public
 . sequencer: changes in parse_insn_buffer()

 The scripted version of "git rebase -i" wrote and rewrote the todo
 list many times during a single step of its operation, and the
 recent C-rewrite made a faithful conversion of the logic to C.  The
 implementation has been updated to carry necessary information
 around in-core to avoid rewriting the same file over and over
 unnecessarily.

 With too many topics in-flight that touch sequencer and rebaser,
 this need to wait giving precedence to other topics that fix bugs.

 well as Git native transport.
