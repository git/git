What's cooking in git.git (Sep 2009, #01; Sat, 05)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones
marked with '.' do not appear in any of the integration branches, but I am
still holding onto them.

After the 1.6.5 cycle, the next release will be 1.7.0, and we will push
out the planned "push safety" change.  1.7.0 would be a good time to
introduce "justifiable" changes that are not strictly backward compatible.

During 1.6.5 cycle, 'next' will hold topics meant for 1.6.5 and 1.7.0.

I will probably do 1.6.5-rc0 this weekend, leaving some topics still
cooking in 'next'.

--------------------------------------------------

[New Topics]

* pk/fast-import-tars (2009-09-03) 1 commit
 - import-tars: Allow per-tar author and commit message.

 - diff --color: color blank-at-eof
 - diff --whitespace=warn/error: fix blank-at-eof check
 - diff --whitespace=warn/error: obey blank-at-eof
 - diff.c: the builtin_diff() deals with only two-file comparison
 - apply --whitespace: warn blank but not necessarily empty lines at EOF
 - apply --whitespace=warn/error: diagnose blank at EOF
 - apply.c: split check_whitespace() into two
 - apply --whitespace=fix: detect new blank lines at eof correctly
 - apply --whitespace=fix: fix handling of blank lines at the eof

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* jh/notes (2009-08-27) 12 commits.
 - Add '%N'-format for pretty-printing commit notes
 - Add flags to get_commit_notes() to control the format of the note string
 - notes.c: Implement simple memory pooling of leaf nodes

I heard the cvs-helper series depends on this one.  It seems that the
fan-out strategy is being rethought?

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

Builds on db/vcs-helper.  There is a re-roll planned.

* pk/fast-import-dirs (2009-09-03) 1 commit
 - Add script for importing bits-and-pieces to Git.

With an updated key-value quoting rules, which I haven't carefully looked
at.  Aren't there standard libraries to do this sort of thing without us
having to hand-roll these logic every time, I have to wonder...

* jn/gitweb-blame (2009-09-01) 5 commits
 - gitweb: Minify gitweb.js if JSMIN is defined
 - gitweb: Create links leading to 'blame_incremental' using JavaScript
 - gitweb: Colorize 'blame_incremental' view during processing
 - gitweb: Incremental blame (using JavaScript)
 - gitweb: Add optional "time to generate page" info in footer

Ajax-y blame.  The first part should be in 'next' shortly.

* js/stash-dwim (2009-07-27) 1 commit.
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-08-16 at 67896c4)
 + Make 'git stash -k' a short form for 'git stash save --keep-index'
 (this branch is used by tr/reset-checkout-patch.)

  (merged to 'next' on 2009-09-03 at d4f2ed7)
 + stash: simplify defaulting to "save" and reject unknown options
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-08-27 at d314281)

  (merged to 'next' on 2009-08-18 at e465bb3)
 + tests: disable interactive hunk selection tests if perl is not available
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-08-16 at 67896c4)
 + DWIM 'git stash save -p' for 'git stash -p'
 + Implement 'git stash save --patch'

 + Implement 'git reset --patch'
 + builtin-add: refactor the meat of interactive_add()
 + Add a small patch-mode testing library
 + git-apply--interactive: Refactor patch mode code
 (this branch uses js/stash-dwim.)

DWIMmery of the two series tightened for safety.  This should be ready for
1.6.5.

* jc/upload-pack-hook (2009-08-28) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-08-31 at f9933a5)

 + upload-pack: add a trigger for post-upload-pack hook

* jk/clone-b (2009-08-26) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-08-30 at 10a68d1)
 + clone: add --branch option to select a different HEAD

* je/send-email-no-subject (2009-08-05) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-08-30 at b6455c2)
 + send-email: confirm on empty mail subjects

The existing tests to covers the positive case (i.e. as long as the user
says "yes" to the "do you really want to send this message that lacks
subject", the message is sent) of this feature, but the feature itself
needs its own test to verify the negative case (i.e. does it correctly
stop if the user says "no"?)

* jc/mailinfo-scissors (2009-08-26) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-08-30 at 5fc6248)
 + mailinfo.scissors: new configuration
 + am/mailinfo: Disable scissors processing by default
 + Documentation: describe the scissors mark support of "git am"
 + Teach mailinfo to ignore everything before -- >8 -- mark
 + builtin-mailinfo.c: fix confusing internal API to mailinfo()

I didn't pick up the patch to simplify the definition of scissors. I do
not have strong opinion on it either way, but the list would hopefully
decide it before too long.

 - sequencer: add "reset_almost_hard()" and related functions
 - rebase -i: use "git sequencer--helper --make-patch"
 - sequencer: add "make_patch" function to save a patch
 - sequencer: add "builtin-sequencer--helper.c"

Migrating "rebase -i" bit by bit to C.

 - fast-import: test the new option command
 - fast-import: add option command
 - fast-import: test the new feature command
 - fast-import: add feature command

--------------------------------------------------
[For 1.7.0]

* jc/1.7.0-status (2009-08-15) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-08-22 at b3507bb)
 + git status: not "commit --dry-run" anymore
 + git stat -s: short status output
 + git stat: the beginning of "status that is not a dry-run of commit"

With this, "git status" is no longer "git commit --preview".

* jc/1.7.0-send-email-no-thread-default (2009-08-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-08-22 at 5106de8)
 + send-email: make --no-chain-reply-to the default

* jc/1.7.0-diff-whitespace-only-status (2009-08-30) 4 commits.
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-08-30 at 0623572)
 + diff.c: fix typoes in comments
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-08-27 at 81fb2bd)
 + Make test case number unique
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-08-02 at 9c08420)
 + diff: Rename QUIET internal option to QUICK
 + diff: change semantics of "ignore whitespace" options

This changes exit code from "git diff --ignore-whitespace" and friends
when there is no actual output.  It is a backward incompatible change, but
we could argue that it is a bugfix.

* jc/1.7.0-push-safety (2009-02-09) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-08-02 at 38b82fe)
 + Refuse deleting the current branch via push
 + Refuse updating the current branch in a non-bare repository via push

--------------------------------------------------
[I have been too busy to purge these]

* jc/log-tz (2009-03-03) 1 commit.
 - Allow --date=local --date=other-format to work as expected

Maybe some people care about this.  I dunno.

* jc/mailinfo-remove-brackets (2009-07-15) 1 commit.
 - mailinfo: -b option keeps [bracketed] strings that is not a [PATCH] marker

Maybe some people care about this.  I dunno.

* ar/maint-1.6.2-merge-recursive-d-f (2009-05-11) 2 commits.
 . Fix for a merge where a branch has an F->D transition
 . Add a reminder test case for a merge with F/D transition

* jc/merge-convert (2009-01-26) 1 commit.
 . git-merge-file: allow converting the results for the work tree

* lt/read-directory (2009-05-15) 3 commits.
 . Add initial support for pathname conversion to UTF-8
 . read_directory(): infrastructure for pathname character set conversion
 . Add 'fill_directory()' helper function for directory traversal

* ps/blame (2009-03-12) 1 commit.
 . blame.c: start libifying the blame infrastructure

* pb/tracking (2009-07-16) 7 commits.
 . branch.c: if remote is not config'd for branch, don't try delete push config
 . branch, checkout: introduce autosetuppush
 . move deletion of merge configuration to branch.c
 . remote: add per-remote autosetupmerge and autosetuprebase configuration
 . introduce a struct tracking_config
 . branch: install_branch_config and struct tracking refactoring
 . config: allow false and true values for branch.autosetuprebase

Has been ejected from 'pu' for some time, expecting a reroll.

* ne/rev-cache (2009-08-21) 6 commits
 . support for path name caching in rev-cache
 . full integration of rev-cache into git, completed test suite
 . administrative functions for rev-cache, start of integration into git
 . support for non-commit object caching in rev-cache
 . basic revision cache system, no integration or features
 . man page and technical discussion for rev-cache

Updated but seems to break upload-pack tests when merged to 'pu'; given
what this series touches, breakages in that area are expected.
May discard if a working reroll comes, to give it a fresh start.
