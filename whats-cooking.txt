What's cooking in git.git (Mar 2021, #04; Sun, 14)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'seen' (formerly 'pu'---proposed updates) while commits prefixed
with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

Git 2.31 final is expected to be tagged on Mar 15, 2021 (monday).

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

Release tarballs are available at:

* jk/symlinked-dotgitx-files (2020-10-23) 9 commits
 - docs: document symlink restrictions for .git* files
 - fsck: complain when .gitattributes or .gitignore is a symlink
 - verify_path(): disallow symlinks in .gitattributes and .gitignore
 - t0060: test obscured .gitattributes and .gitignore matching

 - t7450: test verify_path() handling of gitmodules
 - t7415: rename to expand scope
 - fsck_tree(): wrap some long lines
 - fsck_tree(): fix shadowed variable

 "git fsck" and the corresponding check done during the transport
 learned to ensure that in-tree files like `.gitignore` and
 `.gitattributes` are not symbolic links.

 It seems that there are real projects with .gitignore recorded as
 symlinks, which may need to loosen the fsck setting.  Do we need to
 introduce a class that is separate from symlinked .gitmodules that
 has potential consequences that is more/less grave, so that these
 projects can opt out of the new checks?

[Cooking]

* dl/stash-show-untracked (2021-03-05) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-03-08 at 510d4cfa5f)
 + stash show: learn stash.showIncludeUntracked
 + stash show: teach --include-untracked and --only-untracked

 "git stash show" learned to optionally show untracked part of the
 stash.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* hn/reftable (2021-03-12) 15 commits
 - Add "test-tool dump-reftable" command.
 - git-prompt: prepare for reftable refs backend
 - Reftable support for git-core
 - reftable: rest of library

 The "reftable" backend for the refs API.


* ab/tests-cleanup-around-sha1 (2021-03-10) 4 commits
 - tests: get rid of $_x05 from the test suite
 - shortlog tests: rewrite to get rid of --abbrev=35 hardcoding
 - test-lib: remove unused $_x40 and $_z40 variables
 - git-bisect: remove unused SHA-1 $x40 shell variable

 Remove variables that hold regexp and glob that match fixed number
 of hexadecimal digits from the test suite.

 Expecting a reroll.
 At least the last one weakens a test and should be dropped; there
 may be similar breakage due to not understanding what they are
 trying to test.


* jk/filter-branch-sha256 (2021-03-10) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-03-14 at e4e624590a)
 + filter-branch: drop $_x40 glob
 + filter-branch: drop multiple-ancestor warning
 + t7003: test ref rewriting explicitly

 Code clean-up.

 Will cook in 'next'.
 In the longer term, we might want to remove filter-branch and nudge
 folks to more modern tools.


* ab/make-cocci-dedup (2021-03-12) 5 commits

 - Makefile/coccicheck: allow for setting xargs concurrency
 - Makefile/coccicheck: speed up and fix bug with duplicate hunks
 - Makefile/coccicheck: add comment heading for all SPATCH flags

 Coccicheck update.

 IIUC, the "speed up" claimed in the intermediate steps are all gone
 when correctness is brought back in with the last step.  The series
 needs a restructuring to avoid confuing readers with "it produces
 incorrect result very quickly" followed by "we now produce right
 result, even more correct than the original, but we are not all
 that fast" progression.


* ab/read-tree (2021-03-11) 6 commits
 . tree.h API: remove "stage" parameter from read_tree_recursive()
 . tree.h API: remove support for starting at prefix != ""
 . ls-files: refactor away read_tree()
 . ls-files: don't needlessly pass around stage variable
 . tree.c API: move read_tree() into builtin/ls-files.c
 . ls-files tests: add meaningful --with-tree tests

 Code simplification by removing support for a caller that is long gone.

 It turns out that a new caller is just about to happen.


* ab/unexpected-object-type (2021-03-08) 7 commits
 - tag: don't misreport type of tagged objects in errors
 - object tests: add test for unexpected objects in tags
 - object.c: add a utility function for "expected type X, got Y"
 - tree.c: fix misindentation in parse_tree_gently()
 - oid_object_info(): return "enum object_type"
 - object.c: make type_from_string() return "enum object_type"
 - object.c: refactor type_from_string_gently()

 Error reporting upon object type mismatch has been improved

 Looked good except for some rewrites.

 - symbolic-ref: don't leak shortened refname in check_symref()

 Plug or annotate remaining leaks that trigger while running the
 very basic set of tests.

  (merged to 'next' on 2021-03-01 at 357954af7c)
 + convert: fail gracefully upon missing clean cmd on required filter

 We had a code to diagnose and die cleanly when a required
 clean/smudge filter is missing, but an assert before that
 unnecessarily fired, hiding the end-user facing die() message.

 Will cook in 'next'.

* cm/rebase-i-fixup-amend-reword (2021-03-13) 6 commits
 - doc/git-commit: add documentation for fixup=[amend|reword] options
 - t3437: use --fixup with options to create amend! commit
 - t7500: add tests for --fixup=[amend|reword] options
 - commit: add a reword suboption to --fixup
 - commit: add amend suboption to --fixup to create amend! commit
 - sequencer: export and rename subject_length()
 (this branch uses cm/rebase-i and cm/rebase-i-updates.)

 "git commit --fixup=<commit>", which was to tweak the changes made
 to the contents while keeping the original log message intact,
 learned "--fixup=(amend|reword):<commit>", that can be used to
 tweak both the message and the contents, and only the message,
 respectively.

 Expecting a reroll.

* jk/open-dotgitx-with-nofollow (2021-02-16) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-25 at a784bf7be6)
 + mailmap: do not respect symlinks for in-tree .mailmap
 + exclude: do not respect symlinks for in-tree .gitignore
 + attr: do not respect symlinks for in-tree .gitattributes
 + exclude: add flags parameter to add_patterns()
 + attr: convert "macro_ok" into a flags field
 + add open_nofollow() helper

 It does not make sense to make ".gitattributes", ".gitignore" and
 ".mailmap" symlinks, as they are supposed to be usable from the
 object store (think: bare repositories where HEAD:.mailmap etc. are
 used).  When these files are symbolic links, we used to read the
 contents of the files pointed by them by mistake, which has been
 corrected.

 Follow-up fixes to "cm/rebase-i" topic.

 Will cook in 'next', together with "cm/rebase-i".

 (this branch is used by cm/rebase-i-fixup-amend-reword and cm/rebase-i-updates.)

 "rebase -i" is getting cleaned up and also enhanced.

 Will cook in 'next', together with "cm/rebase-i-updates".


* tb/geometric-repack (2021-03-05) 13 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-03-08 at def1c48d43)
 + builtin/repack.c: reword comment around pack-objects flags
 + builtin/repack.c: be more conservative with unsigned overflows
 + builtin/repack.c: assign pack split later
 + t7703: test --geometric repack with loose objects
 + builtin/repack.c: do not repack single packs with --geometric
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-25 at a854fdbaff)
 + builtin/repack.c: add '--geometric' option
 + packfile: add kept-pack cache for find_kept_pack_entry()
 + builtin/pack-objects.c: rewrite honor-pack-keep logic
 + p5303: measure time to repack with keep
 + p5303: add missing &&-chains
 + builtin/pack-objects.c: add '--stdin-packs' option
 + revision: learn '--no-kept-objects'
 + packfile: introduce 'find_kept_pack_entry()'

 "git repack" so far has been only capable of repacking everything
 under the sun into a single pack (or split by size).  A cleverer
 strategy to reduce the cost of repacking a repository has been
 introduced.

 Will cook in 'next'.
