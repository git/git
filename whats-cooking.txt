What's cooking in git.git (Sep 2021, #03; Fri, 10)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen',
which means nothing more than that I have found them of interest for
some reason (like "it may have hard-to-resolve conflicts with
another topic already in flight" or "this may turn out to be
useful").  Do not read too much into a topic being in (or not in)
'seen'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of the
integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

  (merged to 'next' on 2021-09-01 at bc883fce56)
 + sequencer: advise if skipping cherry-picked commit

 "git rebase" by default skips changes that are equivalent to
 commits that are already in the history the branch is rebased onto;
 give messages when this happens to let the users be aware of
 skipped commits, and also teach them how to tell "rebase" to keep
 duplicated changes.


* js/maintenance-launchctl-fix (2021-08-24) 2 commits

 + t5730: introduce fetch command helper

 "git upload-pack" which runs on the other side of "git fetch"
 forgot to take the ref namespaces into account when handling
 want-ref requests.


* me/t5582-cleanup (2021-08-24) 1 commit

  (merged to 'next' on 2021-09-03 at 3a60892d9a)
 + send-email: avoid incorrect header propagation

 Even when running "git send-email" without its own threaded
 discussion support, a threading related header in one message is

 threading, which has been corrected.

  (merged to 'next' on 2021-09-03 at 9787178599)
 + clone: set submodule.recurse=true if submodule.stickyRecursiveClone enabled

 After "git clone --recurse-submodules", all submodules are cloned
 but they are not by default recursed into by other commands.  With
 submodule.stickyRecursiveClone configuration set, submodule.recurse
 configuration is set to true in a repository created by "clone"
 with "--recurse-submodules" option.

  (merged to 'next' on 2021-08-30 at d243498893)

  (merged to 'next' on 2021-08-30 at 35b9d158e8)
 + branch: allow deleting dangling branches with --force

 "git branch -D <branch>" used to refuse to remove a broken branch
 ref that points at a missing commit, which has been corrected.


* rs/git-mmap-uses-malloc (2021-08-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-08-30 at 6339c8e657)
 + compat: let git_mmap use malloc(3) directly

 mmap() imitation used to call xmalloc() that dies upon malloc()
 failure, which has been corrected to just return an error to the
 caller to be handled.

  (merged to 'next' on 2021-08-30 at a3cb0f4745)

 The parser for the "--nl" option of "git column" has been
 corrected.


* sg/set-ceiling-during-tests (2021-08-30) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-09-01 at 5378ce3817)
 + test-lib: set GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES to protect the surrounding repository

 Buggy tests could damage repositories outside the throw-away test
 area we created.  We now by default export GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES
 to limit the damage from such a stray test.


* tb/add-objects-in-unpacked-packs-simplify (2021-08-29) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-09-01 at 66b0f8564d)

 changing a directory to a file (or vice versa).


* js/pull-release-packs-before-fetching (2021-09-08) 2 commits
 - pull: release packs before fetching
 - commit-graph: when closing the graph, also release the slab
 (this branch is used by js/run-command-close-packs.)

 "git pull" was taught to close open file descriptors to the
 packfiles before spawning "git fetch" to help auto-gc that may be
 invoked by it.

 - http: don't hardcode the value of CURL_SOCKOPT_OK

 Conditional compilation around versions of libcURL has been
 straightened out.

 - sparse-index: integrate with cherry-pick and rebase
 - sequencer: ensure full index if not ORT strategy
 - t1092: add cherry-pick, rebase tests
 - merge-ort: expand only for out-of-cone conflicts
 - merge: make sparse-aware with ORT
 - diff: ignore sparse paths in diffstat
 (this branch uses ds/sparse-index-ignored-files.)

 Various mergy operations have been prepared to work efficiently
 with the sparse index.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/http-backend-handle-proto-header (2021-09-09) 1 commit
 - http-backend: handle HTTP_GIT_PROTOCOL CGI variable

 Taking advantage of the CGI interface, http-backend has been
 updated to enable protocol v2 automatically when the other side
 asks for it.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* js/run-command-close-packs (2021-09-09) 4 commits
 - Close object store closer to spawning child processes
 - run_auto_maintenance(): implicitly close the object store
 - run-command: offer to close the object store before running
 - run-command: prettify the `RUN_COMMAND_*` flags
 (this branch uses js/pull-release-packs-before-fetching.)

 The run-command API has been updated so that the callers can easily
 ask the file descriptors open for packfiles to be closed immediately
 before spawning commands that may trigger auto-gc.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jt/add-submodule-odb-clean-up (2021-09-09) 3 commits
 - revision: remove "submodule" from opt struct
 - repository: support unabsorbed in repo_submodule_init
 - submodule: remove unnecessary unabsorbed fallback

 More code paths that uses the hack to add submodule's object
 database to the set of alternate object store have been cleaned up.

* rs/no-mode-to-open-when-appending (2021-09-09) 1 commit
 - refs/files-backend: remove unused open mode parameter

 The "mode" word is useless in a call to open(2) that does not
 create a new file.  Such a call in the files backend of the ref
 subsystem has been cleaned up.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* rs/setup-use-xopen-and-xdup (2021-09-09) 1 commit
 - setup: use xopen and xdup in sanitize_stdfds

 Code clean-up.

 upon the same event and control via the configuration variables.

 On hold.
 This is an interim one that goes with the updated ab/config-based-hooks-base.

* ao/p4-avoid-decoding (2021-04-12) 2 commits
 - git-p4: do not decode data from perforce by default
 - git-p4: avoid decoding more data from perforce

 "git p4" in Python-2 days used to accept a lot more kinds of data
 from Perforce server as uninterrupted byte sequence, but after
 switching to Python-3, too many things are expected to be in UTF-8,
 which broke traditional use cases.

 Will discard.
 Have been stalled for too long.

 files (like build artifacts) outside the sparse cone, allowing the
 entire directory outside the sparse cone to be removed, which is
 especially useful when the sparse patterns change.

 Continued work on top of the hn/refs-errno-cleanup topic.


* hn/refs-errno-cleanup (2021-08-25) 4 commits
 - refs: make errno output explicit for read_raw_ref_fn
 - refs/files-backend: stop setting errno from lock_ref_oid_basic
 - refs: remove EINVAL errno output from specification of read_raw_ref_fn
 - refs file backend: move raceproof_create_file() here
 (this branch is used by ab/refs-errno-cleanup; uses ab/refs-files-cleanup.)

 Futz with the way 'errno' is relied on in the refs API to carry the
 failure modes up the callchain.

* np/blame-ignore-revs-file-may-be-optional (2021-08-09) 1 commit
 - blame: add config `blame.ignoreRevsFileIsOptional`

 When the file named by blame.ignoreRevsFile configuration variable
 does not exist, it causes "git blame" to die.  Sometimes, it is
 useful if the files named by configuration variables can be made
 optional (it would allow ~/.gitconfig to give a filename, and make
 it effective only in repositories that have a file with that name).

 This uses an extra variable that marks that the variable is
 optional.  Yet another alternative is being discussed to define
 syntax for "optional" filename values, so that the same mechanism
 can be used for not just blame.ignoreRevsFile but other filenames.

 Queued just as a reminder of the theme.

 - clone: Allow combining --bare and --origin

 "git clone" did not like to take "--bare" and "--origin=X" at the
 same time; loosen the restriction.
