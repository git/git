What's cooking in git.git (Sep 2022, #02; Fri, 9)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a future
release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and aren't
considered "accepted" at all.  A topic without enough support may be
discarded after a long period of no activity.

We are at the end of week #9 in a 12-week cycle toward Git 2.38
(tinyurl.com/gitCal).  I plan to tag -rc0 (i.e. preview) on the 15th
or so, but I expect that many folks are busy in Chicago for Git Merge
so let's not make a big fuss about it and instead treat it as just one
of the regular updates to the 'master' branch.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

Release tarballs are available at:

 + add -p: detect more mismatches between plain vs colored diffs

 Those who use diff-so-fancy as the diff-filter noticed a regression
 or two in the code that parses the diff output in the built-in

* jk/rev-list-verify-objects-fix (2022-09-07) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2022-09-07 at 5da58e2145)
 + rev-list: disable commit graph with --verify-objects
 + lookup_commit_in_graph(): use prepare_commit_graph() to check for graph

 "git rev-list --verify-objects" ought to inspect the contents of
 objects and notice corrupted ones, but it didn't when the commit
 graph is in use, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.
 source: <Yxe0k++LA/UfFLF/@coredump.intra.peff.net>


* jk/upload-pack-skip-hash-check (2022-09-07) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2022-09-07 at f638a5a7c9)
 + t1060: check partial clone of misnamed blob
 + parse_object(): check commit-graph when skip_hash set
 + upload-pack: skip parse-object re-hashing of "want" objects
 + parse_object(): allow skipping hash check

 The server side that responds to "git fetch" and "git clone"
 request has been optimized by allowing it to send objects in its
 object store without recomputing and validating the object names.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 + diff-no-index: simplify argv index calculation
 + diff-no-index: release prefixed filenames
 + diff-no-index: release strbuf on queue error
 (this branch is used by jc/diff-no-index-two-stdin.)

 "git diff --no-index A B" managed its the pathnames of its two
 input files rather haphazardly, sometimes leaking them.  The
 command line argument processing has been straightened out to clean
 it up.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 + notes: simplify default operation mode arguments check
 + test-parse-options.c: fix style of comparison with zero

 The codepath for the OPT_SUBCOMMAND facility has been cleaned up.

 + list_objects_filter_options: plug leak of filter_spec strings
 + transport: free filter options in disconnect_git()
 + transport: deep-copy object-filter struct for fetch-pack
 + list_objects_filter_copy(): deep-copy sparse_oid_name field

 The code that manages list-object-filter structure, used in partial
 clones, leaked the instances, which has been plugged.

 Will merge to 'master'.

* jk/proto-v2-ref-prefix-fix (2022-09-08) 2 commits
 - fetch: add branch.*.merge to default ref-prefix extension
 - fetch: stop checking for NULL transport->remote in do_fetch()

 "git fetch" over protocol v2 sent an incorrect ref prefix request
 to the server and made "git pull" with configured fetch refspec
 that does not cover the remote branch to merge with fail, which has
 been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.

* pw/rebase-keep-base-fixes (2022-09-07) 7 commits
 - rebase --keep-base: imply --no-fork-point
 - rebase --keep-base: imply --reapply-cherry-picks
 - rebase: factor out branch_base calculation
 - rebase: rename merge_base to branch_base
 - rebase: store orig_head as a commit
 - t3416: set $EDITOR in subshell
 - t3416: tighten two tests

 "git rebase --keep-base" used to discard the commits that are
 already cherry-picked to the upstream, even when "keep-base" meant
 that the base, on top of which the history is being rebuilt, does
 not yet include these cherry-picked commits.  The --keep-base
 option now implies --reapply-cherry-picks and --no-fork-point
 options.

 Overall looking good, with some iffy bits.

 + mv: from in-cone to out-of-cone
 + mv: remove BOTH from enum update_mode

 + mv: free the with_slash in check_dir_in_index()
 + mv: rename check_dir_in_index() to empty_dir_has_sparse_contents()
 + t7002: add tests for moving from in-cone to out-of-cone

 "git mv A B" in a sparsely populated working tree can be asked to
 move a path from a directory that is "in cone" to another directory
 that is "out of cone".  Handling of such a case has been improved.

 Will merge to 'next'.
