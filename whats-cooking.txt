What's cooking in git.git (Dec 2020, #02; Mon, 14)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'seen' (formerly 'pu'---proposed updates) while commits prefixed
with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

A preview release 2.30-rc0 has been tagged; there are too many
topics in flight, sadly many of which haven't been adequately
reviewed.  I wish we had half the number of topics that had been
reviewed twice as better, but such is life.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

Release tarballs are available at:

[Graduated to 'master']

* ae/doc-reproducible-html (2020-12-02) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-12-08 at 263232f371)
 + doc: make HTML manual reproducible

 Newer versions of xsltproc can assign IDs in HTML documents it
 generates in a consistent manner.  Use the feature to help format
 HTML version of the user manual reproducibly.


* da/vs-build-iconv-fix (2020-12-04) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-12-08 at 4c6c5054a3)
 + ci(vs-build): stop passing the iconv library location explicitly

 Build update.


* dd/help-autocorrect-never (2020-11-25) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-12-08 at f1531ab641)
 + help.c: help.autocorrect=never means "do not compute suggestions"

 "git $cmd $args", when $cmd is not a recognised subcommand, by
 default tries to see if $cmd is a typo of an existing subcommand
 and optionally executes the corrected command if there is only one
 possibility, depending on the setting of help.autocorrect; the
 users can now disable the whole thing, including the cycles spent
 to find a likely typo, by setting the configuration variable to
 'never'.


* fc/atmark-in-refspec (2020-11-30) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-12-08 at bfded23c1c)
 + refspec: make @ a synonym of HEAD
 + tests: push: trivial cleanup
 + tests: push: improve cleanup of HEAD tests

 "@" sometimes worked (e.g. "git push origin @:there") as a part of
 a refspec element, but "git push origin @" did not work, which has
 been corrected.


* jk/check-config-parsing-error-in-upload-pack (2020-12-03) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-12-08 at b618c7d956)
 + upload-pack: propagate return value from object filter config callback

 Tighten error checking in the codepath that responds to "git fetch".


* jk/multi-line-indent-style-fix (2020-12-03) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-12-08 at e6d1026437)
 + style: indent multiline "if" conditions to align

 Style fix.


* js/cmake-extra-built-ins-fix (2020-12-04) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-12-08 at f29945cb35)
 + cmake: determine list of extra built-ins dynamically

 VSbuild fix.


* js/t5526-with-no-particular-primary-branch-name (2020-12-04) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-12-08 at b16af9417c)
 + t5526: drop the prereq expecting the default branch name `main`
 + t5526: avoid depending on a specific default branch name

 Test update.


* so/glossary-branch-is-not-necessarily-active (2020-12-02) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-12-08 at 01805f8ab6)
 + glossary: improve "branch" definition

 The glossary described a branch as an "active" line of development,
 which is misleading---a stale and non-moving branch is still a
 branch.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* en/merge-ort-3 (2020-12-14) 11 commits
 - merge-ort: add implementation of type-changed rename handling
 - merge-ort: add implementation of normal rename handling
 - merge-ort: add implementation of rename/delete conflicts
 - merge-ort: add implementation of rename collisions
 - merge-ort: add implementation of both sides renaming differently

 Rename detection is added to the "ORT" merge strategy.


* jk/disambiguate-equal-in-config-param (2020-12-09) 3 commits
 - config: store "git -c" variables using more robust format
 - config: parse more robust format in GIT_CONFIG_PARAMETERS
 - quote: make sq_dequote_step() a public function
 (this branch uses ps/config-env-pairs.)

 The quoting rules used to pass "git -c var=val" configuration
 across processes have been updated in a backward compatible way, so
 that the value read from an environment variable can contain an
 equal sign when using the "git --config-env var=env" feature.

 We may want to make this just a part of the ps/config-env-pairs
 topic with a bit of patch shuffling.


* js/t7900-protect-pwd-in-config-get (2020-12-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-12-14 at 61ff5e9b5b)
 + t7900: use --fixed-value in git-maintenance tests

 Hotfix for test breakage.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* bc/hashed-mailmap (2020-12-12) 1 commit
 - mailmap: support hashed entries in mailmaps

 The mailmap database learned to take hashed value as the original
 side of mapping.

 Expecting a reroll.


* jb/midx-doc-update (2020-12-14) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-12-14 at 880b50e89d)
 + docs: multi-pack-index: remove note about future 'verify' work

 Doc update.

 Will merge to 'next' and to 'master'.


* jh/index-v2-doc-on-fsmn (2020-12-14) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-12-14 at bd3507ccc8)
 + index-format.txt: document v2 format of file system monitor extension

 Doc update.

 (this branch is used by mt/rm-sparse-checkout.)

 "git grep" has been tweaked to be limited to the sparse checkout
 paths.


* mt/rm-sparse-checkout (2020-12-08) 1 commit
 - rm: honor sparse checkout patterns
 (this branch uses mt/grep-sparse-checkout.)

 "git rm" follows suit to "git grep" to ignore paths outside the
 sparsity pattern when the sparse checkout feature is in use.

 Need to wait for how these fit in larger picture.

* jk/symlinked-dotgitx-files (2020-10-23) 9 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-10-26 at c1dd37b024)
 + docs: document symlink restrictions for .git* files
 + fsck: complain when .gitattributes or .gitignore is a symlink
 + verify_path(): disallow symlinks in .gitattributes and .gitignore
 + t0060: test obscured .gitattributes and .gitignore matching
 + t7450: test .gitmodules symlink matching against obscured names
 + t7450: test verify_path() handling of gitmodules
 + t7415: rename to expand scope
 + fsck_tree(): wrap some long lines
 + fsck_tree(): fix shadowed variable

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2020-10-23

 "git fsck" and the corresponding check done during the transport
 learned to ensure that in-tree files like `.gitignore` and
 `.gitattributes` are not symbolic links.

 It seems that there are real projects with .gitignore recorded as
 symlinks, which may need to loosen the fsck setting.  Do we need to
 introduce a class that is separate from symlinked .gitmodules that
 probably is with potential consequences that is more/less grave?


* sm/curl-retry (2020-10-13) 3 commits
 - http: automatically retry some requests
 - replace CURLOPT_FILE With CURLOPT_WRITEDATA
 - remote-curl: add testing for intelligent retry for HTTP

 The http transport has been taught to retry a failed request that
 may reasonably be retried.

 Expecting a reroll.

 - core.abbrev <off|false|no> disables abbreviations

 Allow the configuration to specify no abbreviation regardless of
 the hash algorithm.

 Expecting a reroll.  The intent is very good.


* ar/fetch-transfer-ipversion (2020-09-16) 1 commit
 - config: option transfer.ipversion to set transport protocol version for network fetches

 Adds transfer.ipversion configuration variable.

 Needs more work.

 The first step to remove on-disk binaries for built-in subcommands
 by soliciting objections.

 On hold for now.


* dr/push-remoteref-fix (2020-04-23) 1 commit
 - remote.c: fix handling of %(push:remoteref)

 The "%(push:remoteref)" placeholder in the "--format=" argument of
 "git format-patch" (and friends) only showed what got explicitly
 configured, not what ref at the receiving end would be updated when
 "git push" was used, as it ignored the default behaviour (e.g. update
 the same ref as the source).

 Discard for now.

* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2018-10-15) 1 commit
 - zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

 - pull: display default warning only when non-ff

 - pull: get rid of unnecessary global variable
 - pull: give the advice for choosing rebase/merge much later

 When a user does not tell "git pull" to use rebase or merge, the
 command gives a loud message telling a user to choose between
 rebase or merge but creates a merge anyway, forcing users who would
 want to rebase to redo the operation.  Fix an early part of this
 problem by tightening the condition to give the message---there is
 no reason to stop or force the user to choose between rebase or
 merge if the history fast-forwards.

* sj/untracked-files-in-submodule-directory-is-not-dirty (2020-12-08) 1 commit
 - diff: do not show submodule with untracked files as "-dirty"

 "git diff" showed a submodule working tree with untracked cruft as
 "Submodule commit <objectname>-dirty", but a natural expectation is
 that the "-dirty" indicator would align with "git describe --dirty",
 which does not consider having untracked files in the working tree
 as source of dirtiness.  The inconsistency has been fixed.
