What's cooking in git.git (Dec 2023, #03; Mon, 18)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and
aren't considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL
to a message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity (of course they can be resubmit when new interests
arise).

The 'maint' branch now points at the maintenance track of Git 2.43,
which was released earlier in the month, and the tip of 'next' has
been rewound and rebuilt on top of Git 2.43.  I am planning to start
ejecting topics that have been in the "stalled" state for too long.

The RelNotes symbolic link says we are now working towards Git 2.44.
It may not be a bad idea to reflect on what technical debt and UI
warts we have accumulated so far to see if we have enough of them to
start planning for a breaking Git 3.0 release (or, of course, keep
incrementally improve the system, which is much more preferrable---
continuity and stability is good).

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/

 breaking change.  "--ignore-other-worktrees" option is required to
 unbreak you, if you are used to the current behaviour that "-B"
 overrides the safety.

* jw/builtin-objectmode-attr (2023-12-12) 2 commits
 - SQUASH??? - leakfix
 - attr: add builtin objectmode values support

 The builtin_objectmode attribute is populated for each path
 without adding anything in .gitattributes files, which would be
 useful in magic pathspec, e.g., ":(attr:builtin_objectmode=100755)"
 to limit to executables.

 Needs to get leakfix reviewed.

* tb/merge-tree-write-pack (2023-10-23) 5 commits
 - builtin/merge-tree.c: implement support for `--write-pack`

 - bulk-checkin: introduce `index_blob_bulk_checkin_incore()`
 - bulk-checkin: generify `stream_blob_to_pack()` for arbitrary types
 - bulk-checkin: extract abstract `bulk_checkin_source`

 "git merge-tree" learned "--write-pack" to record its result
 without creating loose objects.

 - bloom.h: make `load_bloom_filter_from_graph()` public
 - t/helper/test-read-graph.c: extract `dump_graph_info()`
 - gitformat-commit-graph: describe version 2 of BDAT
 - commit-graph: ensure Bloom filters are read with consistent settings
 - revision.c: consult Bloom filters for root commits
 - t/t4216-log-bloom.sh: harden `test_bloom_filters_not_used()`

 The Bloom filter used for path limited history traversal was broken
 on systems whose "char" is unsigned; update the implementation and
 bump the format version to 2.

 - rebase -i: ignore signals when forking subprocesses

 If the commit log editor or other external programs (spawned via
 "exec" insn in the todo list) receive internactive signal during
 "git rebase -i", it caused not just the spawned program but the
 "Git" process that spawned them, which is often not what the end
 user intended.  "git" learned to ignore SIGINT and SIGQUIT while
 waiting for these subprocesses.
