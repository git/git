What's cooking in git.git (Mar 2013, #05; Mon, 18)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.

We have been scheduling each cycle to last for 8-10 weeks, but at
the end of 1.8.2 cycle we already have quite a many topics already
in flight.  I am wondering perhaps we should cut this cycle a bit
short by tagging -rc0 shortly after we have those we already have
been cooking graduated to 'master' (we already have 200 non-merge
commits on 'next').

This issue classifies these topics in flight into three categories:
Trivially Safe, Safe and Risky.  "Risky" does not mean the topic is
with known breakages, but just that my gut feeling tells it would
not be surprising if there were unintended consequences, either
these topics touch fairly deep part of the codepath, their design
may not match some obscure but still valid use cases, or for some
other unforeseen reason.  Feeding this message to "cook -w" (found
in 'todo' branch) script may make the overall picture easier to
review.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* ap/combine-diff-ignore-whitespace (2013-03-14) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-18 at 32435a6)
 + Allow combined diff to ignore white-spaces

 Teach "diff --cc" output to honor options to ignore various forms
 of whitespace changes.

 Will merge to 'master' in the 4th batch (Safe).


* jk/checkout-attribute-lookup (2013-03-14) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-15 at 28bd515)
 + entry: fix filter lookup
 + t2003: modernize style

 Codepath to stream blob object contents directly from the object
 store to filesystem did not use the correct path to find conversion
 filters when writing to temporary files.

 Will merge to 'master' in the 4th batch (Safe).


* jk/difftool-dir-diff-edit-fix (2013-03-14) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-15 at add7b77)
 + difftool --dir-diff: symlink all files matching the working tree
 + difftool: avoid double slashes in symlink targets
 + git-difftool(1): fix formatting of --symlink description

 "git difftool --dir-diff" made symlinks to working tree files when
 preparing a temporary directory structure, so that accidental edits
 of these files in the difftool are reflected back to the working
 tree, but the logic to decide when to do so was not quite right.

 Will merge to 'master' in the 4th batch (Safe).


* lf/setup-prefix-pathspec (2013-03-14) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-14 at 7552204)
 + setup.c: check that the pathspec magic ends with ")"
 + setup.c: stop prefix_pathspec() from looping past the end of string

 Rerolls aw/setup-prefix-pathspec.

 Will merge to 'master' in the 3rd batch (Safe).


* tb/document-status-u-tradeoff (2013-03-16) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-18 at 2fc53b0)
 + status: advise to consider use of -u when read_directory takes too long
 + git status: document trade-offs in choosing parameters to the -u option

 Suggest users to look into using--untracked=no option when "git
 status" takes too long.

 Will merge to 'master' in the 2nd batch (Trivially Safe).


* jk/fully-peeled-packed-ref (2013-03-18) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-18 at cbcfa32)
 + pack-refs: add fully-peeled trait
 + pack-refs: write peeled entry for non-tags
 + use parse_object_or_die instead of die("bad object")
 + avoid segfaults on parse_object failure

 Not that we do not actively encourage having annotated tags outside
 refs/tags/ hierarchy, but they were not advertised correctly to the
 ls-remote and fetch with recent version of Git.

 Will merge to 'master' in the 3rd batch (Safe).


* jk/peel-ref (2013-03-16) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-18 at 77f0e4e)

 + upload-pack: make sure "want" objects are parsed
 + upload-pack: drop lookup-before-parse optimization

 Recent optimization broke shallow clones.

 Will merge to 'master' in the 3rd batch (Safe).

* nd/preallocate-hash (2013-03-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-18 at 0b928c5)
 + Preallocate hash tables when the number of inserts are known in advance

 When we know approximately how many entries we will have in the
 hash-table, it makes sense to size the hash table to that number
 from the beginning to avoid unnecessary rehashing.

 Will merge to 'master' in the 2nd batch (Trivially Safe).


* pe/pull-rebase-v-q (2013-03-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-18 at 8e17883)

 (this branch uses rs/zip-compresssed-size-with-export-subst.)

 Will merge to 'master' in the 4th batch (Safe).


* jk/fast-export-object-lookup (2013-03-17) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-18 at 98c436d)

 - Teach clone to set remote.default.
 - Teach "git remote" about remote.default.
 - Teach remote.c about the remote.default configuration setting.

 When the user does not specify what remote to interact with, we
 often attempt to use 'origin'.  This can now be customized via a
 configuration variable.

 Expecting a reroll.
 $gmane/210151

 "The first remote becomes the default" bit is better done as a
 separate step.

* ph/tag-force-no-warn-on-creation (2013-03-13) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-14 at 809e9ae)

 + Merge branch 'jc/reflog-reverse-walk' into nd/branch-show-rebase-bisect-state
 (this branch uses jc/reflog-reverse-walk.)

 Will merge to 'master' in the 4th batch (Safe).


* kb/p4merge (2013-03-13) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-14 at 6d390d4)
 + mergetools/p4merge: create a base if none available
 + mergetools/p4merge: swap LOCAL and REMOTE

 Adjust the order mergetools feeds the files to the p4merge backend
 to match the p4 convention.

 Will merge to 'master' in the 3rd batch (Safe).


* jc/maint-push-refspec-default-doc (2013-03-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-14 at 912eb14)
 + Documentation/git-push: clarify the description of defaults

 Clarify in the documentation "what" gets pushed to "where" when the
 command line to "git push" does not say these explicitly.

 Will merge to 'master' in the 2nd batch (Trivially Safe).


* jc/reflog-reverse-walk (2013-03-08) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-14 at 3f2ed32)
 + reflog: add for_each_reflog_ent_reverse() API
 + for_each_recent_reflog_ent(): simplify opening of a reflog file
 + for_each_reflog_ent(): extract a helper to process a single entry
 (this branch is used by nd/branch-show-rebase-bisect-state.)

 An internal function used to implement "git checkout @{-1}" was
 hard to use correctly.

 Will merge to 'master' in the 3rd batch (Safe).


* jk/alias-in-bare (2013-03-08) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-09 at 2f9d72a)
 + setup: suppress implicit "." work-tree for bare repos
 + environment: add GIT_PREFIX to local_repo_env
 + cache.h: drop LOCAL_REPO_ENV_SIZE

 An aliased command spawned from a bare repository that does not say
 it is bare with "core.bare = yes" is treated as non-bare by mistake.

 Will merge to 'master' in the 3rd batch (Safe).


* pw/p4-symlinked-root (2013-03-11) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-12 at 559b926)
 + git p4: avoid expanding client paths in chdir
 + git p4 test: should honor symlink in p4 client root
 + git p4 test: make sure P4CONFIG relative path works

 Will merge to 'master' in the 3rd batch (Safe).


* jc/add-2.0-delete-default (2013-03-08) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-14 at 4684748)
 + git add <pathspec>... defaults to "-A"
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-14 at 2b7a7a2)
 + git add: start preparing for "git add <pathspec>..." to default to "-A"
 + builtin/add.c: simplify boolean variables

 "git add dir/" updated modified files and added new files, but does
 not notice removed files, which may be "Huh?" to some users.  They
 can of course use "git add -A dir/", but why should they?

 There seemed to be some interest in this topic, so resurrected and
 rebased on top of recent documentation updates to propose a
 possible transition plan.

 Will cook in 'next' until Git 2.0.


* jc/add-2.0-u-A-sans-pathspec (2013-03-14) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-14 at 9538716)
 + git add: -u/-A now affects the entire working tree
 + t2200: check that "add -u" limits itself to subdirectory

 "git add -u/-A" without pathspec has traditonally limited its
 operation to the current directory and its subdirectories, but in
 Git 1.8.2 we started encouraging users to be more explicit to
 specify "." when they mean it (and use ":/" to make it affect the
 entire working tree).  With this, we finally change the behaviour
 and make it affect the entire working tree in Git 2.0.

 Will cook in 'next' until Git 2.0.


* jk/empty-archive (2013-03-10) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-12 at 942e592)
 + archive: handle commits with an empty tree
 + test-lib: factor out $GIT_UNZIP setup

 "git archive" reports a failure when asked to create an archive out
 of an empty tree.  It would be more intuitive to give an empty
 archive back in such a case.

 Will merge to 'master' in the 3rd batch (Safe).


* jk/graph-c-expose-symbols-for-cgit (2013-03-03) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-04 at be35b12)
 + Revert "graph.c: mark private file-scope symbols as static"

 In the v1.8.0 era, we changed symbols that do not have to be global
 to file scope static, but a few functions in graph.c were used by
 CGit from sideways bypassing the entry points of the API the
 in-tree users use.

 Will merge to 'master' in the 1st batch (Trivially Safe).


* we/submodule-update-prefix-output (2013-03-03) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-04 at 908df73)
 + submodule update: when using recursion, show full path

 Will merge to 'master' in the 2nd batch (Safe).


* jc/nobody-sets-src-peer-ref (2013-03-04) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-07 at 1910e21)
 + match_push_refs(): nobody sets src->peer_ref anymore

 Dead code removal.

 Even though I think this change is correct, please report
 immediately if you find any unintended side effect.

 Will merge to 'master' in the 4th batch (Risky).


* jc/push-follow-tag (2013-03-05) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-09 at 748fbed)
 + push: --follow-tags
 + commit.c: use clear_commit_marks_many() in in_merge_bases_many()
 + commit.c: add in_merge_bases_many()
 + commit.c: add clear_commit_marks_many()

 The new "--follow-tags" option tells "git push" to push relevant
 annotated tags when pushing branches out.

 Will merge to 'master' in the 3rd batch (Safe).


* jc/maint-reflog-expire-clean-mark-typofix (2013-03-05) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-07 at 0a61cbb)

 Will merge to 'master' in the 3rd batch (Safe).


* lf/bundle-verify-list-prereqs (2013-03-08) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-08 at 9e55d6d)
 + bundle: Add colons to list headings in "verify"
 + bundle: Fix "verify" output if history is complete

 Will merge to 'master' in the 1st batch (Trivially Safe).


* ks/rfc2047-one-char-at-a-time (2013-03-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-09 at a12465e)
 + format-patch: RFC 2047 says multi-octet character may not be split

 When "format-patch" quoted a non-ascii strings on the header files,
 it incorrectly applied rfc2047 and chopped a single character in
 the middle of it.

 Will merge to 'master' in the 3rd batch (Safe).


* kb/name-hash (2013-02-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-05 at 7f7e5d4)
 + name-hash.c: fix endless loop with core.ignorecase=true

 The code to keep track of what directory names are known to Git on
 platforms with case insensitive filesystems can get confused upon
 a hash collision between these pathnames and looped forever.

 Even though I think this change is correct, please report
 immediately if you find any unintended side effect.

 Will merge to 'master' in the 4th batch (Risky).


* rs/zip-compresssed-size-with-export-subst (2013-02-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-03 at c1ac6d8)
 + archive-zip: fix compressed size for stored export-subst files
 (this branch is used by rs/archive-zip-raw-compression.)

 When export-subst is used, "zip" output recorded incorrect
 size of the file.

 Will merge to 'master' in the 2nd batch (Safe).


* jc/describe (2013-02-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-05 at 6b353f3)
 + describe: --match=<pattern> must limit the refs even when used with --all

 The "--match=<pattern>" option of "git describe", when used with
 "--all" to allow refs that are not annotated tags to be used as a
 base of description, did not restrict the output from the command
 to those that match the given pattern.

 We may want to have a looser matching that does not restrict to tags,
 but that can be done as a follow-up topic; this step is purely a bugfix.

 Will merge to 'master' in the 3rd batch (Safe).


* jk/mailsplit-maildir-muttsort (2013-03-02) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-03 at d5f7735)

 Kept outside 'pu' for now as it collides with nd/magic-pathspecs.


* jc/perl-cat-blob (2013-02-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-02-25 at 7c0079a)
 + Git.pm: fix cat_blob crashes on large files

 perl/Git.pm::cat_blob slurped everything in core only to write it
 out to a file descriptor, which was not a very smart thing to do.

 Will merge to 'master' in the 2nd batch (Safe).


* nd/doc-index-format (2013-02-23) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-02-26 at 4d3caea)

 The logic used by "git diff -M --stat" to shorten the names of
 files before and after a rename did not work correctly when the
 common prefix and suffix between the two filenames overlapped.

 "git status" has been optimized by taking advantage of the fact
 that paths that are already known to the index do not have to be

 "submodule init".  "submodule deinit" is the way to do so.

 + Fix `make install` when configured with autoconf
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-02-12 at eb8af04)
 + Makefile: do not export mandir/htmldir/infodir
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-02-07 at 33f7d4f)
 + config.mak.in: remove unused definitions

 config.mak.in template had an "export" line to cause a few
 common makefile variables to be exported; if they need to be
 expoted for autoconf/configure users, they should also be exported
 for people who write config.mak the same way.  Move the "export" to
 the main Makefile.  Also, stop exporting mandir that used to be
 exported (only) when config.mak.autogen was used.  It would have
 broken installation of manpages (but not other documentation
 formats).

 immediately if you find any unintended side effect.

 The --simplify-merges logic did not cull irrelevant parents from a

 Consolidates codepaths that inspect log-message-to-be and decide to

 no negative behaviour change in this series, but please report any
 iffy behaviour change immediately if you notice one.
