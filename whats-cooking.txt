What's cooking in git.git (Nov 2020, #05; Wed, 25)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'seen' (formerly 'pu'---proposed updates) while commits prefixed
with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

The number of topics merged for the next release since Git 2.29 has 
just passed 100 after the 8th batch of them have graduated.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into.  Some repositories have
only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

Release tarballs are available at:

[Graduated to 'master']

* ab/config-mak-uname-simplify (2020-11-11) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-11-12 at e1bd51ee71)
 + config.mak.uname: remove unused NEEDS_SSL_WITH_CURL flag
 + config.mak.uname: remove unused the NO_R_TO_GCC_LINKER flag

 Build configuration cleanup.


* en/strmap (2020-11-11) 15 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-11-12 at 41519a5f5c)
 + shortlog: use strset from strmap.h
 + Use new HASHMAP_INIT macro to simplify hashmap initialization
 + strmap: take advantage of FLEXPTR_ALLOC_STR when relevant
 + strmap: enable allocations to come from a mem_pool
 + strmap: add a strset sub-type
 + strmap: split create_entry() out of strmap_put()
 + strmap: add functions facilitating use as a string->int map
 + strmap: enable faster clearing and reusing of strmaps
 + strmap: add more utility functions

 + hashmap: allow re-use after hashmap_free()
 + hashmap: adjust spacing to fix argument alignment
 + hashmap: add usage documentation explaining hashmap_free[_entries]()
 (this branch is used by en/merge-ort-impl.)

 A specialization of hashmap that uses a string as key has been
 introduced.  Hopefully it will see wider use over time.


* fc/bash-completion-alias-of-alias (2020-11-17) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-11-18 at 4241203041)
 + completion: bash: improve alias loop detection
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-11-10 at 75f1f2b8a8)
 + completion: bash: check for alias loop
 + completion: bash: support recursive aliases

 The command line completion script (in contrib/) learned to expand
 commands that are alias of alias.


* jc/ci-github-set-env (2020-11-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-11-19 at 00ff5e06ac)
 + ci: avoid `set-env` construct in print-test-failures.sh

 Another CI adjustment.


* jc/format-patch-name-max (2020-11-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-11-11 at 17e19bb17a)
 + format-patch: make output filename configurable

 The maximum length of output filenames "git format-patch" creates
 has become configurable (used to be capped at 64).


* jk/4gb-idx (2020-11-16) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-11-18 at 2f99b73bda)
 + packfile: detect overflow in .idx file size checks
 + block-sha1: take a size_t length parameter
 + fsck: correctly compute checksums on idx files larger than 4GB
 + use size_t to store pack .idx byte offsets

 The code was not prepared to deal with pack .idx file that is
 larger than 4GB.

  (merged to 'next' on 2020-11-12 at 3b21625881)
 + t7800: simplify difftool test
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-11-09 at 6d89b9602d)
 + diff: allow passing NULL to diff_free_filespec_data()
 (this branch is used by js/default-branch-name-tests-final-stretch.)

 Running "git diff" while allowing external diff in a state with
 unmerged paths used to segfault, which has been corrected.


* jk/rev-parse-end-of-options (2020-11-10) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-11-11 at 2d517d1608)
 + rev-parse: handle --end-of-options
 + rev-parse: put all options under the "-" check
 + rev-parse: don't accept options after dashdash

 "git rev-parse" learned the "--end-of-options" to help scripts to
 safely take a parameter that is supposed to be a revision, e.g.
 "git rev-parse --verify -q --end-of-options $rev".


* jx/t5411-flake-fix (2020-11-11) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-11-18 at badb1fefe5)
 + receive-pack: use default version 0 for proc-receive
 + receive-pack: gently write messages to proc-receive
 + t5411: new helper filter_out_user_friendly_and_stable_output

 The exchange between receive-pack and proc-receive hook did not
 carefully check for errors.

  (merged to 'next' on 2020-11-18 at 7cf396ee81)
 + list-objects-filter-options: fix function name in BUG

 Error message fix.
 We can further update it to lose the hand-maintained function name
 from the message, but that can be done separately.


* pd/mergetool-nvimdiff (2020-11-11) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-11-12 at aff20da3a2)
 + mergetool: avoid letting `list_tool_variants` break user-defined setups
 + mergetools/bc: add `bc4` to the alias list for Beyond Compare

 Fix regression introduced when nvimdiff support in mergetool was added.

  (merged to 'next' on 2020-11-18 at bdd3b21b7c)
 + submodules: fix of regression on fetching of non-init subsub-repo

 "git fetch" did not work correctly with nested submodules where the
 innermost submodule that is not of interest got updated in the
 upstream, which has been corrected.


* rs/archive-plug-leak-refname (2020-11-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-11-19 at 270ba7b8be)

 Memleak fix.


* sg/bisect-approximately-halfway (2020-11-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-11-18 at b13026a0f3)
 + bisect: loosen halfway() check for a large number of commits

 "git bisect start/next" in a large span of history spends a lot of
 time trying to come up with exactly the half-way point; this can be
 optimized by stopping when we see a commit that is close enough to
 the half-way point.


* sg/t5310-jgit-wants-sha1 (2020-11-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-11-19 at 72fb4e7155)
 + t5310-pack-bitmaps: skip JGit tests with SHA256

 Since jgit does not yet work with SHA-256 repositories, mark the
 tests that uses it not to run unless we are testing with ShA-1
 repositories.


* sg/tests-prereq (2020-11-18) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-11-23 at e8926781aa)

 - rm: honor sparse checkout patterns
 (this branch uses mt/grep-sparse-checkout.)

 "git rm" follows suit to "git grep" to ignore paths outside the
 sparsity pattern when the sparse checkout feature is in use.

 Need to wait for how these fit in larger picture.

* jk/symlinked-dotgitx-files (2020-10-23) 9 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-10-26 at c1dd37b024)
 + docs: document symlink restrictions for .git* files
 + fsck: complain when .gitattributes or .gitignore is a symlink
 + verify_path(): disallow symlinks in .gitattributes and .gitignore
 + t0060: test obscured .gitattributes and .gitignore matching
 + t7450: test .gitmodules symlink matching against obscured names
 + t7450: test verify_path() handling of gitmodules
 + t7415: rename to expand scope
 + fsck_tree(): wrap some long lines
 + fsck_tree(): fix shadowed variable

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2020-10-23

 "git fsck" and the corresponding check done during the transport
 learned to ensure that in-tree files like `.gitignore` and
 `.gitattributes` are not symbolic links.

 It seems that there are real projects with .gitignore recorded as
 symlinks, which may need to loosen the fsck setting.  Do we need to
 introduce a class that is separate from symlinked .gitmodules that
 probably is with potential consequences that is more/less grave?

 - remote.c: fix handling of %(push:remoteref)

 The "%(push:remoteref)" placeholder in the "--format=" argument of

 configured, not what ref at the receiving end would be updated when
 "git push" was used, as it ignored the default behaviour (e.g. update
 the same ref as the source).

* dd/help-autocorrect-never (2020-11-25) 1 commit
 - help.c: help.autocorrect=never means "do not compute suggestions"

 "git $cmd $args", when $cmd is not a recognised subcommand, by
 default tries to see if $cmd is a typo of an existing subcommand
 and optionally executes the corrected command if there is only one
 possibility, depending on the setting of help.autocorrect; the
 users can now disable the whole thing, including the cycles spent
 to find a likely typo, by setting the configuration variable to
 'never'.

 Getting there.

 learn the "--literal-value" option to take the value_regex option
 as a literal string.

 Expecting a (hopefully final) reroll.

 maintenance tasks to support platforms whose native scheduling
 methods are not 'cron'.


* sj/untracked-files-in-submodule-directory-is-not-dirty (2020-10-26) 1 commit
 - diff: do not show submodule with untracked files as "-dirty"

 "git diff" showed a submodule working tree with untracked cruft as
 "Submodule commit <objectname>-dirty", but a natural expectation is
 that the "-dirty" indicator would align with "git describe --dirty",
 which does not consider having untracked files in the working tree
 as source of dirtiness.  The inconsistency has been fixed.

 Needs doc update and also adjusting "git status".


* ak/corrected-commit-date (2020-10-08) 10 commits
 - doc: add corrected commit date info
 - commit-reach: use corrected commit dates in paint_down_to_common()

 - commit-graph: add a slab to store topological levels
 - commit-graph: return 64-bit generation number
 - commit-graph: consolidate fill_commit_graph_info
 - revision: parse parent in indegree_walk_step()
 - commit-graph: fix regression when computing Bloom filters

 The commit-graph learned to use corrected commit dates instead of
 the generation number to help topological revision traversal.
