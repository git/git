What's cooking in git.git (Oct 2018, #01; Wed, 10)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

We haven't seen much complaints and breakages reported against the
two big "rewrite in C" topics around "rebase"; perhaps it is a good
time to merge them to 'next' soonish to cook them for a few weeks
before moving them to 'master'?

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

 "git multi-pack-index" learned to detect corruption in the .midx
 file it uses, and this feature has been integrated into "git fsck".

* dz/credential-doc-url-matching-rules (2018-09-27) 1 commit
 - doc: clarify gitcredentials path component matching

 Doc update.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* en/status-multiple-renames-to-the-same-target-fix (2018-09-27) 1 commit
 - commit: fix erroneous BUG, 'multiple renames on the same target? how?'

 The code in "git status" sometimes hit an assertion failure.  This
 was caused by a structure that was reused without cleaning the data
 used for the first run, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jc/how-to-document-api (2018-09-29) 1 commit
 - CodingGuidelines: document the API in *.h files

 Doc update.

* jc/rebase-in-c-5-test-typofix (2018-09-28) 1 commit
 - rebase: fix typoes in error messages

 Typofix.


* jc/war-on-string-list (2018-09-28) 1 commit
 - fetch: replace string-list used as a look-up table with a hashmap

 Replace two string-list instances used as look-up tables in "git
 fetch" with a pair of hashmaps.  WIP as there is another such use
 of string-list nearby that should be converted at the same time.


* jk/check-everything-connected-is-long-gone (2018-09-25) 1 commit
 - receive-pack: update comment with check_everything_connected

 Comment fix.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/oideq-hasheq-cleanup (2018-10-04) 1 commit
 - more oideq/hasheq conversions

 Code clean-up.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* js/mingw-wants-vista-or-above (2018-10-04) 3 commits
 - mingw: bump the minimum Windows version to Vista
 - mingw: set _WIN32_WINNT explicitly for Git for Windows
 - compat/poll: prepare for targeting Windows Vista

 The minimum version of Windows supported by Windows port fo Git is
 now set to Vista.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* js/rebase-i-break (2018-10-09) 1 commit
 - rebase -i: introduce the 'break' command
 (this branch uses ag/rebase-i-in-c; is tangled with ag/sequencer-reduce-rewriting-todo, js/rebase-in-c-5.5-work-with-rebase-i-in-c and pk/rebase-in-c-6-final.)

 "git rebase -i" learned a new insn, 'break', that the user can
 insert in the to-do list.  Upon hitting it, the command returns
 control back to the user.

 Will hold, waiting for the "rebase-in-c" and "rebase-i-in-c" topics.


* js/remote-archive-v2 (2018-09-28) 4 commits
 - archive: allow archive over HTTP(S) with proto v2
 - archive: implement protocol v2 archive command
 - archive: use packet_reader for communications
 - archive: follow test standards around assertions

 The original implementation of "git archive --remote" more or less
 bypassed the transport layer and did not work over http(s).  The
 version 2 of the protocol is defined to allow going over http(s) as
 well as Git native transport.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jt/non-blob-lazy-fetch (2018-10-04) 2 commits
 - fetch-pack: exclude blobs when lazy-fetching trees
 - fetch-pack: avoid object flags if no_dependents

 A partial clone that is configured to lazily fetch missing objects
 will on-demand issue a "git fetch" request to the originating
 repository to fill not-yet-obtained objects.  The request has been
 optimized for requesting a tree object (and not the leaf blob
 objects contained in it) by telling the originating repository that
 no blobs are needed.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ma/commit-graph-docs (2018-09-27) 4 commits
 - Doc: refer to the "commit-graph file" with dash
 - git-commit-graph.txt: refer to "*commit*-graph file"

* nd/help-commands-verbose-by-default (2018-10-03) 1 commit
 - help -a: improve and make --verbose default

 "git help -a" and "git help -av" give different pieces of
 information, and generally the "verbose" version is more friendly
 to the new users.  "git help -a" by default now uses the more
 verbose output (with "--no-verbose", you can go back to the
 original).  Also "git help -av" now lists aliases and external
 commands, which it did not used to.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* nd/packobjectshook-doc-fix (2018-09-29) 1 commit
 - config.txt: correct the note about uploadpack.packObjectsHook

 Doc update.

 - diff --color-moved-ws: fix another memory leak
 - diff --color-moved-ws: fix a memory leak
 - diff --color-moved-ws: fix out of bounds string access
 - diff --color-moved-ws: fix double free crash

 Various fixes to "diff --color-moved-ws".

 What's the status of this topic?


* rs/grep-no-recursive (2018-10-03) 1 commit
 - grep: add -r/--[no-]recursive

 Unlike "grep", "git grep" by default recurses to the whole tree.
 The command learned "git grep --recursive" option, so that "git
 grep --no-recursive" can serve as a synonym to setting the
 max-depth to 0.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* rs/oidset-on-khash (2018-10-04) 5 commits
 - oidset: uninline oidset_init()
 - oidset: use khash
 - khash: factor out kh_release_*
 - fetch-pack: load tip_oids eagerly iff needed
 - fetch-pack: factor out is_unmatched_ref()

 The oidset API was built on top of the oidmap API which in turn is
 on the hashmap API.  Replace the implementation to build on top of
 the khash API and gain performance.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* rs/sequencer-oidset-insert-avoids-dups (2018-10-03) 1 commit

 - split-index: don't compare stat data of entries already marked for split index
 - split-index: count the number of deleted entries
 - t1700-split-index: date back files to avoid racy situations
 - split-index: add tests to demonstrate the racy split index problem
 - t1700-split-index: document why FSMONITOR is disabled in this test script

 The codepath to support the experimental split-index mode had
 remaining "racily clean" issues fixed.

 Expecting the final one.

* ag/sequencer-reduce-rewriting-todo (2018-10-09) 16 commits
 - rebase--interactive: move transform_todo_file() to rebase--interactive.c
 - sequencer: fix a call to error() in transform_todo_file()
 - sequencer: use edit_todo_list() in complete_action()
 - rebase-interactive: rewrite edit_todo_list() to handle the initial edit
 - rebase-interactive: append_todo_help() changes
 - rebase-interactive: use todo_list_transform() in edit_todo_list()
 - sequencer: refactor skip_unnecessary_picks() to work on a todo_list
 - sequencer: change complete_action() to use the refactored functions
 - sequencer: make sequencer_make_script() write its script to a strbuf
 - sequencer: refactor transform_todos() to work on a todo_list
 - sequencer: refactor rearrange_squash() to work on a todo_list
 - sequencer: refactor sequencer_add_exec_commands() to work on a todo_list
 - sequencer: refactor check_todo_list() to work on a todo_list
 - sequencer: make the todo_list structure public
 - sequencer: clear the number of items of a todo_list before parsing
 - Merge branch 'ag/rebase-i-in-c' into ag/sequencer-reduce-rewriting-todo
 (this branch uses ag/rebase-i-in-c; is tangled with js/rebase-i-break, js/rebase-in-c-5.5-work-with-rebase-i-in-c and pk/rebase-in-c-6-final.)

 The scripted version of "git rebase -i" wrote and rewrote the todo
 list many times during a single step of its operation, and the
 recent C-rewrite made a faithful conversion of the logic to C.  The
 implementation has been updated to carry necessary information
 around in-core to avoid rewriting the same file over and over
 unnecessarily.

 Will hold, waiting for the "rebase-in-c" and "rebase-i-in-c" topics.


* bc/editorconfig (2018-10-09) 2 commits
 - editorconfig: indicate settings should be kept in sync
 - editorconfig: provide editor settings for Git developers

 To help developers, an EditorConfig file that attempts to follow
 the project convention has been added.

* js/fuzzer (2018-10-10) 2 commits
 - fuzz: add fuzz testing for packfile indices
 - fuzz: add basic fuzz testing target

 An experiment to fuzz test a few areas, hopefully we can gain more
 coverage to various areas.


* jt/avoid-ls-refs (2018-10-07) 4 commits
 - fetch: do not list refs if fetching only hashes
 - transport: list refs before fetch if necessary
 - transport: do not list refs if possible
 - transport: allow skipping of ref listing

 Over some transports, fetching objects with an exact commit object
 name can be done without first seeing the ref advertisements.  The
 code has been optimized to exploit this.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jt/cache-tree-allow-missing-object-in-partial-clone (2018-10-10) 1 commit
 - cache-tree: skip some blob checks in partial clone

 In a partial clone that will lazily be hydrated from the
 originating repository, we generally want to avoid "does this
 object exist (locally)?" on objects that we deliberately omitted
 when we created the clone.  The cache-tree codepath (which is used
 to write a tree object out of the index) however insisted that the
 object exists, even for paths that are outside of the partial
 checkout area.  The code has been updated to avoid such a check.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 What's the status of this topic?


* np/log-graph-octopus-fix (2018-10-10) 1 commit
 - log: fix coloring of certain octopus merge shapes

 "git log --graph" showing an octopus merge sometimes miscounted the
 number of display columns it is consuming to show the merge and its
 parent commits, which has been corrected.

 Expecting a clarification.

* rs/subtree-fixes (2018-10-07) 4 commits
 - subtree: improve decision on merges kept in split
 - subtree: use commits before rejoins for splits
 - subtree: make --ignore-joins pay attention to adds
 - subtree: refactor split of a commit into standalone method

 Various subtree fixes.

 Will merge to 'next'.
 Unless somebody objects, that is.

* sf/complete-stash-list (2018-10-07) 1 commit

 The completion script (in contrib/) lerned to complete a handful of

 Will merge to 'next'.


* tb/filter-alternate-refs (2018-10-09) 4 commits
 - transport.c: introduce core.alternateRefsPrefixes
 - transport.c: introduce core.alternateRefsCommand
 - transport.c: extract 'fill_alternate_refs_command'
 - transport: drop refnames from for_each_alternate_ref

 When pushing into a repository that borrows its objects from an
 alternate object store, "git receive-pack" that responds to the
 push request on the other side lists the tips of refs in the
 alternate to reduce the amount of objects transferred.  This
 sometimes is detrimental when the number of refs in the alternate
 is absurdly large, in which case the bandwidth saved in potentially
 fewer objects transferred is wasted in excessively large ref
 advertisement.  The alternate refs that are advertised are now
 configurable with a pair of configuration variables.

 Will merge to 'next'.

* bw/submodule-name-to-dir (2018-08-10) 2 commits
 - submodule: munge paths to submodule git directories
 - submodule: create helper to build paths to submodule gitdirs

 In modern repository layout, the real body of a cloned submodule
 repository is held in .git/modules/ of the superproject, indexed by
 the submodule name.  URLencode the submodule name before computing
 the name of the directory to make sure they form a flat namespace.

 Kicked back to 'pu', expecting further work on the topic.

* ng/status-i-short-for-ignored (2018-08-09) 1 commit
 - status: -i shorthand for --ignored command line option

 "git status --ignored" gained a shorthand "git status -i".

 Will discard, after hearing no strong support.
 What's the list opinion on this one?  It is Meh to me, but
 obviously the author cared enough to write a patch, so...


* sb/submodule-move-head-with-corruption (2018-08-28) 2 commits
 - submodule.c: warn about missing submodule git directories
 - t2013: add test for missing but active submodule

 . commit: fix exit code when doing a dry run
 . wt-status: teach wt_status_collect about merges in progress
 . wt-status: rename commitable to committable
 . t7501: add coverage for flags which imply dry runs

 "git commit --dry-run" gave a correct exit status even during a
 conflict resolution toward a merge, but it did not with the
 "--short" option, which has been corrected.

 Seems to break 7512, 3404 and 7060 in 'pu'.


* ma/wrapped-info (2018-05-28) 2 commits
 - usage: prefix all lines in `vreportf()`, not just the first

 error(), and friends more easily translatable.

 Will discard and wait for a cleaned-up rewrite.

* hn/bisect-first-parent (2018-04-21) 1 commit
 - bisect: create 'bisect_flags' parameter in find_bisection()
 (this branch is used by tb/bisect-first-parent.)

 Preliminary code update to allow passing more flags down the
 bisection codepath in the future.

 We do not add random code that does not have real users to our
 codebase, so let's have it wait until such a real code materializes
 before too long.

 I just rebased the topic to a newer base as it did not build
 standalone with the base I originally queued the topic on, but
 otherwise there is no update to address any of the review comments
 in the thread above---we are still waiting for a reroll.


* jk/drop-ancient-curl (2017-08-09) 5 commits
 - http: #error on too-old curl
 - curl: remove ifdef'd code never used with curl >=7.19.4
 - http: drop support for curl < 7.19.4

 Expecting a reroll.


* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2017-08-10) 1 commit
 . zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

 Needs resurrecting by making sure the fix is good and still applies
 (or adjusted to today's codebase).

 The final step of rewriting "rebase -i" in C.

 Undecided.
 I've been using this (i.e. the whole "rebase -i" and "rebase"
 rewritten in C) in my personal build, and I also know users on
 Windows port have been using it with the last feature release.  I
 am tempted to merge the whole thing to 'next' soonish.

 Opinions?  It's the last chance to remove any existing and avoid
 any future "oops, that was wrong, and here is a fix-up"
 embarrassment in these topics.

 "git stash" rewritten in C.

 Undecided.  This also has been part of my personal build.  I do not
 offhand recall if this also had the same exposure to the end users
 as "rebase" and "rebase -i".  I am tempted to merge this to 'next'
 soonish.

 Opinions?

 - add -p: optimize line selection for short hunks
 - add -p: allow line selection to be inverted
 - add -p: select modified lines correctly
 - add -p: select individual hunk lines

 "git add -p" interactive interface learned to let users choose
 individual added/removed lines to be used in the operation, instead
 of accepting or rejecting a whole hunk.

* ds/commit-graph-with-grafts (2018-08-21) 8 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-09 at 851a457102)
 + commit-graph: close_commit_graph before shallow walk
 + commit-graph: not compatible with uninitialized repo
 + commit-graph: not compatible with grafts
 + commit-graph: not compatible with replace objects
 + test-repository: properly init repo
 + commit-graph: update design document
 + refs.c: upgrade for_each_replace_ref to be a each_repo_ref_fn callback
 + refs.c: migrate internal ref iteration to pass thru repository argument

 The recently introduced commit-graph auxiliary data is incompatible
 with mechanisms such as replace & grafts that "breaks" immutable
 nature of the object reference relationship.  Disable optimizations
 based on its use (and updating existing commit-graph) when these
 incompatible features are in use in the repository.

* jn/gc-auto (2018-07-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-10 at 9f0f1f770e)
 + gc: do not return error for prior errors in daemonized mode
 (this branch uses jn/gc-auto-prep.)

 "gc --auto" ended up calling exit(-1) upon error, which has been
 corrected to use exit(1).  Also the error reporting behaviour when
 daemonized has been updated to exit with zero status when stopping
 due to a previously discovered error (which implies there is no
 point running gc to improve the situation); we used to exit with
 failure in such a case.

 Will merge to 'master'.
