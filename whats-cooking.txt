What's cooking in git.git (Sep 2010, #03; Fri, 10)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones
marked with '.' do not appear in any of the integration branches, but I am
still holding onto them.

We have in 'master' is more-or-less the final 1.7.3; it is tagged as rc1.

Please give it a good beating to find regressions.

Needed to devise a way to grandfather URLs that point at release notes of
older versions, but other than that, this is a good thing to do.

  (merged to 'next' on 2010-09-06 at dbf0d4b)

[Stalled]

* jj/icase-directory (2010-08-16) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-08-26 at 9d8e1bc)
 + Support case folding in git fast-import when core.ignorecase=true
 + Support case folding for git add when core.ignorecase=true
 + Add case insensitivity support when using git ls-files
 + Add case insensitivity support for directories when using git status
 + Case insensitivity support for .gitignore via core.ignorecase
 + Add string comparison functions that respect the ignore_case variable.

Depends on GNU FNM_CASEFOLD.  Presumably a bit of tweak in Makefile for
non-windows but non-GNU platforms is all it takes?

* by/line-log (2010-08-11) 17 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-08-26 at a160ff1)
 + Document line history browser
 + Add tests for line history browser

 + Add --graph prefix before line history output
 + Add parent rewriting to line history browser
 + Make graph_next_line external to other part of git
 + Make rewrite_parents public to other part of git
 + Hook line history into cmd_log, ensuring a topo-ordered walk
 + Print the line log
 + map/take range to the parent of commits
 + Add range clone functions
 + Export three functions from diff.c
 + Parse the -L options
 + Refactor parse_loc
 + Add the basic data structure for line level history
 + parse-options: add two helper functions
 + parse-options: enhance STOP_AT_NON_OPTION

There is a reported crash with valgrind trace.  Bo seems to be looking
into it.

* il/rfc-remote-fd-ext (2010-08-26) 7 commits
 - remote-ext/fd style fixup
 - Fix build on Windows
 - Simplify send_git_request()
 - Rewrite bidirectional traffic loop
 - gitignore: Ignore the new /git-remote-{ext,fd} helpers
 - New remote helper: git-remote-ext
 - New remote helper git-remote-fd

Needs a bit of usage illustration (this does not seem to come with any
documentation nor tests).

* zl/mailinfo-recode-patch (2010-06-14) 2 commits
 - add --recode-patch option to git-am
 - add --recode-patch option to git-mailinfo

I recall there was another round of re-roll planned for this one.

* jk/tag-contains (2010-07-05) 4 commits
 - Why is "git tag --contains" so slow?
 - default core.clockskew variable to one day
 - limit "contains" traversals based on commit timestamp
 - tag: speed up --contains calculation

The idea of the bottom one is probably Ok, except that the use of object
flags needs to be rethought, or at least the helper needs to be moved to
builtin/tag.c to make it clear that it should not be used outside the
current usage context.

* ks/recursive-rename-add-identical (2010-09-01) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-09-03 at 1a5082f)
 + RE: [PATCH] Avoid rename/add conflict when contents are identical

* po/sendemail (2010-09-06) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-09-10 at d39274d)
 + New send-email option smtpserveroption.
 + Remove @smtp_host_parts variable as not used.
 + Minor indentation fix.

* ch/filter-branch-deprecate-remap-to-ancestor (2010-08-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-09-10 at f91d974)
 + filter-branch: retire --remap-to-ancestor

* ch/maint-cannot-create-bundle-error (2010-08-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-09-10 at ba139f1)
 + bundle: detect if bundle file cannot be created

* rr/format-patch-count-without-merges (2010-08-28) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-09-10 at c23bd48)
 + format-patch: Don't go over merge commits
 + t4014-format-patch: Call test_tick before committing

* as/daemon-multi-listen (2010-08-29) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-09-10 at 69e4b23)
 + daemon: allow more than one host address given via --listen
 + daemon: add helper function setup_named_sock()

I think the idea is sound.  It came a bit late in the cycle for the next
release and probably needs a bit more polish.

* jc/pickaxe-grep (2010-08-31) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-09-10 at 3604fc3)
 + diff/log -G<pattern>: tests
 + git log/diff: add -G<regexp> that greps in the patch text
 + diff: pass the entire diff-options to diffcore_pickaxe()
 + gitdiffcore doc: update pickaxe description

This is a re-roll of "grepping inside the log -p output" which is a
feature that is often asked for when people hear about -S option.

* jl/fetch-submodule-recursive (2010-08-30) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-09-10 at 67a5138)
 + Submodules: Add the new "fetch" config option for fetch and pull
 + fetch/pull: Recursively fetch populated submodules

I think the idea is sound and hopefully the end result will help the heavy
users of subprojects.  It came a bit late in the cycle for the next
release, though.

* en/object-list-with-pathspec (2010-08-26) 2 commits
 - Make rev-list --objects work together with pathspecs
 - Add testcases showing how pathspecs are ignored with rev-list --objects

* jf/merge-ignore-ws (2010-08-26) 4 commits
 - merge-recursive: options to ignore whitespace changes
 - merge-recursive --patience
 - ll-merge: replace flag argument with options struct
 - merge-recursive: expose merge options for builtin merge

I think the idea is sound.  It came a bit late in the cycle for the next
release, though.

* rr/fmt-merge-msg (2010-09-08) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-09-10 at 40fe79e)
 + t6200-fmt-merge-msg: Exercise '--log' to configure shortlog length
 + t6200-fmt-merge-msg: Exercise 'merge.log' to configure shortlog length
 + merge: Make 'merge.log' an integer or boolean option
 + merge: Make '--log' an integer option for number of shortlog entries
 + fmt_merge_msg: Change fmt_merge_msg API to accept shortlog_len

* tr/merge-unborn-clobber (2010-08-22) 1 commit
 - Exhibit merge bug that clobbers index&WT

* en/tree-walk-optim (2010-08-26) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-09-10 at 65a9cde)
 + diff_tree(): Skip skip_uninteresting() when all remaining paths interesting
 + tree_entry_interesting(): Make return value more specific
 + tree-walk: Correct bitrotted comment about tree_entry()
 + Document pre-condition for tree_entry_interesting

I think the idea is sound.  For a patch that touches fairly core part of
the system, it came a bit late in the cycle, though.

* cb/ignored-paths-are-precious (2010-08-21) 1 commit
 - checkout/merge: optionally fail operation when ignored files need to be overwritten

I fixed up a trivial error in the configuration parser (which didn't
return immediately after parsing), and while at it flipped the default 
value of the configuration and the command line option to false.

This probably needs tests; also we know of longstanding bugs in related
area that needs to be addressed---they do not have to be part of this
series but their reproduction recipe would belong to the test script for
this topic.

It may hurt users to make the new feature on by default, especially the
ones with subdirectories that come and go.  For a patch that changes a
long established semantics, it came a bit late in the cycle, so it will
have to wait until the next release.

* po/etc-gitattributes (2010-09-01) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-09-10 at c503fd5)
 + Add global and system-wide gitattributes

I think the idea is sound.  For a patch that touches fairly core part of
the system, it came a bit late in the cycle, though.

* gb/shell-ext (2010-08-27) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-08-27 at e1ef3c1)
 + shell: Display errors from improperly-formatted command lines
 + Merge branch 'gb/split-cmdline-errmsg' into gb/shell-ext
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-08-24 at 49ea7b8)
 + shell: Rewrite documentation and improve error message
 + Add sample commands for git-shell
 + Add interactive mode to git-shell for user-friendliness
 + Allow creation of arbitrary git-shell commands

I am not very happy about adding these backdoors to git-shell, which is
primarily a security mechanism, and obviously security and backdoor do not
mix well.
