What's cooking in git.git (Apr 2012, #07; Wed, 18)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.

The second batch of topics in this cycle is now in 'master'.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches of the
repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* js/spawn-via-shell-path-fix (2012-04-17) 1 commit
 - Do not use SHELL_PATH from build system in prepare_shell_cmd on Windows

Mops up an unfortunate fallout from bw/spawn-via-shell-path topic.
Will fast-track to 'master'.

* jm/maint-strncpy-diff-no-index (2012-04-16) 1 commit
 - diff: avoid stack-buffer-read-overrun for very long name

Will merge to 'next'.

* lp/diffstat-with-graph (2012-04-18) 6 commits
 - Prevent graph_width of stat width from falling below min
 - t4052: Test diff-stat output with minimum columns
 - t4052: Adjust --graph --stat output for prefixes
 - Adjust stat width calculations to take --graph output into account
 - Add output_prefix_length to diff_options
 - t4052: test --stat output with --graph

Looked reasonable.
Will merge to 'next'.

* jc/merge-reduce-parents-early (2012-04-17) 4 commits
 - builtin/merge.c: reduce parents early
 - builtin/merge.c: collect other parents early
 - builtin/merge.c: remove "remoteheads" global variable
 - merge tests: octopus with redundant parents
 (this branch is tangled with lt/octopus-simplify.)

This deals with the same issue as lt/octopus-simplify, but in a bit more
systematic way.

* rj/mingw-isguid (2012-04-18) 1 commit
 - compat/mingw.h: Set S_ISUID to prevent a fast-import test failure

* rj/sh-setup-mswin-pwd (2012-04-18) 1 commit
 - git-sh-setup.sh: Add an pwd() function for MinGW

* rj/submodule-mswin-path (2012-04-18) 1 commit
 - git-submodule.sh: Don't use $path variable in eval_gettext string

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* bw/spawn-via-shell-path (2012-04-03) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-04-12 at 0ff833b)
 + Use SHELL_PATH from build system in run_command.c:prepare_shell_cmd

"sh" on the user's PATH may be utterly broken on some systems;
consistently use SHELL_PATH even from inside run-command API.

* jc/commit-unedited-template (2012-04-03) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-04-12 at a2e153b)
 + Documentation/git-commit: rephrase the "initial-ness" of templates
 + git-commit.txt: clarify -t requires editing message
 + commit: rephrase the error when user did not touch templated log message
 + commit: do not trigger bogus "has templated message edited" check
 + t7501: test the right kind of breakage

When "git commit --template F" errors out because the user did not touch
the message, it claimed that it aborts due to "empty message", which was
utterly wrong.

* jc/maint-clean-nested-worktree-in-subdir (2012-03-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-04-12 at 280a6e5)
 + clean: preserve nested git worktree in subdirectories

Originally merged to 'next' on 2012-03-20

"git clean -d -f" (not "-d -f -f") is supposed to protect nested working
trees of independent git repositories that exist in the current project
working tree from getting removed, but the protection applied only to such
working trees that are at the top-level of the current project by mistake.

* jk/add-p-skip-conflicts (2012-04-05) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-04-12 at e65ceb1)
 + add--interactive: ignore unmerged entries in patch mode

Excludes conflicted paths from "add -p" processing, as it is not prepared
to handle them.

* jk/branch-quiet (2012-03-26) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-04-12 at 7d0a438)
 + teach "git branch" a --quiet option
 + checkout: suppress tracking message with "-q"

Even with "-q"uiet option, "checkout" used to report setting up tracking.
Also "branch" learns "-q"uiet option to squelch informational message.

* jk/diff-no-rename-empty (2012-03-23) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-04-12 at d1d95c5)
 + merge-recursive: don't detect renames of empty files
 + teach diffcore-rename to optionally ignore empty content
 + make is_empty_blob_sha1 available everywhere
 + drop casts from users EMPTY_TREE_SHA1_BIN

Forbids rename detection logic from matching two empty files as renames
during merge-recursive to prevent mismerges.

* jk/http-backend-keep-committer-ident-env (2012-03-30) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-04-12 at b2d0136)
 + http-backend: respect existing GIT_COMMITTER_* variables

The smart-http backend used to always override GIT_COMMITTER_* variables
with REMOTE_USER and REMOTE_ADDR.

* nl/rebase-i-cheat-sheet (2012-03-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-04-12 at cd76fcb)
 + rebase -i: remind that the lines are top-to-bottom

Originally merged to 'next' on 2012-03-20

* rs/combine-diff-zero-context-at-the-beginning (2012-03-25) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-04-12 at b4d92e3)
 + combine-diff: fix loop index underflow

Fixes an age old corner case bug in combine diff (only triggered with -U0
and the hunk at the beginning of the file needs to be shown).

* rs/unpack-trees-leakfix (2012-04-10) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-04-12 at 6958b54)
 + unpack-trees: plug minor memory leak
 + unpack-trees: don't perform any index operation if we're not merging

Originally merged to 'next' on 2012-03-07

* sl/autoconf (2012-03-26) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-04-12 at 68f346d)
 + configure: be more idiomatic
 + configure: avoid some code repetitions thanks to m4_{push,pop}def
 + configure: move definitions of private m4 macros before AC_INIT invocation

Updates our configure.ac to follow a better "autoconf" style.

* wk/gitweb-snapshot-use-if-modified-since (2012-03-30) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-04-12 at 611d318)
 + gitweb: add If-Modified-Since handling to git_snapshot().
 + gitweb: refactor If-Modified-Since handling
 + gitweb: add `status` headers to git_feed() responses.

Makes 'snapshot' request to "gitweb" honor If-Modified-Since: header,
based on the commit date.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* cn/apply-fix-ws-can-lengthen-lines (2012-03-11) 1 commit
 . apply: reallocate the postimage buffer when needed

Attempts to address an ancient bug that dates back to the addition
of an oddball "tab-in-indent" whitespace breakage class that wants
to have longer lines than the original when fixing things up; broken
and results in double-frees.

Will discard shortly if nothing happens.

* ss/git-svn-prompt-sans-terminal (2012-01-04) 3 commits
 - fixup! 15eaaf4
 - git-svn, perl/Git.pm: extend Git::prompt helper for querying users
 - perl/Git.pm: "prompt" helper to honor GIT_ASKPASS and SSH_ASKPASS

The bottom one has been replaced with a rewrite based on comments
from Ævar. The second one needs more work, both in perl/Git.pm and
prompt.c, to give precedence to tty over SSH_ASKPASS when terminal
is available.

Will discard shortly if nothing happens.

* jc/split-blob (2012-04-03) 7 commits
 - chunked-object: streaming checkout
 - chunked-object: fallback checkout codepaths
 - bulk-checkin: support chunked-object encoding
 - bulk-checkin: allow the same data to be multiply hashed
 - new representation types in the packstream
 - packfile: use varint functions
 - varint: make it available outside the context of pack
 (this branch is tangled with jc/index-v4.)

Not ready.

I finished the streaming checkout codepath, but as explained in
127b177 (bulk-checkin: support chunked-object encoding, 2011-11-30),
these are still early steps of a long and painful journey. At least
pack-objects and fsck need to learn the new encoding for the series
to be usable locally, and then index-pack/unpack-objects needs to
learn it to be used remotely.

Given that I heard a lot of noise that people want large files, and
that I was asked by somebody at GitTogether'11 privately for an
advice on how to pay developers (not me) to help adding necessary
support, I am somewhat dissapointed that the original patch series
that was sent almost two months ago still remains here without much
comments and updates from the developer community. I even made the
interface to the logic that decides where to split chunks easily
replaceable, and I deliberately made the logic in the original patch
extremely stupid to entice others, especially the "bup" fanboys, to
come up with a better logic, thinking that giving people an easy
target to shoot for, they may be encouraged to help out. The plan is
not working :-(.

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* lp/maint-diff-three-dash-with-graph (2012-03-20) 3 commits
 - t4202: add test for "log --graph --stat -p" separator lines
 - log --graph: fix break in graph lines
 - log --graph --stat: three-dash separator should come after graph lines

Will merge to 'next'.

* cb/cherry-pick-rev-path-confusion (2012-04-15) 1 commit
 - cherry-pick: do not expect file arguments

The command line parser choked "git cherry-pick $name" when $name can be
both revision name and a pathname, even though $name can never be a path
in the context of the command.

The issue the patch addresses is real, but the way it is implemented felt
unnecessarily invasive a bit.  It may be cleaner for this caller to add
the "--" to the end of the argv_array it passes to setup_revisions().

* cb/daemon-test-race-fix (2012-04-15) 1 commit
 - git-daemon wrapper to wait until daemon is ready

Fix race condition between starting and waiting for git-daemon in the
test.

* cb/maint-report-mount-point-correctly-in-setup (2012-04-15) 1 commit
 - properly keep track of current working directory

The filesystem boundary was not correctly reported when .git directory
discovery stopped at a mount point.

Will merge to 'next'.

* jl/maint-submodule-recurse-fetch (2012-04-14) 1 commit
 - submodules: recursive fetch also checks new tags for submodule commits

Will merge to 'next'.

* jn/fast-import-doc (2012-04-15) 1 commit
 - fast-import doc: cat-blob and ls responses need to be consumed quickly

Will merge to 'next'.

* jn/more-i18ncmp (2012-04-14) 3 commits
 - test: am of empty patch should not succeed
 - test: use test_i18ncmp for "Patch format detection failed" message
 - test: do not rely on US English tracking-info messages

Will merge to 'next'.

* rl/maint-stash-i18n-save-error (2012-04-14) 1 commit
 - stash: use eval_gettextln correctly

Will merge to 'next'.

* nd/columns (2012-04-15) 9 commits
 - tag: add --column
 - column: support piping stdout to external git-column process
 - status: add --column
 - branch: add --column
 - help: reuse print_columns() for help -a
 - column: add dense layout support
 - column: add columnar layout
 - Stop starting pager recursively
 - Add column layout skeleton and git-column

Will merge to 'next'.

* nl/http-proxy-more (2012-04-14) 6 commits
 - http: fix proxy authentication
 - http: rename HTTP_REAUTH to HTTP_AUTH_RETRY
 - http: Avoid limit of retrying request only twice
 - http: handle proxy authentication failure (error 407)
 - http: handle proxy proactive authentication
 - http: try http_proxy env var when http.proxy config option is not set

The code to talk to http proxies learn to use the same credential
API used to talk to the final http destinations.  This still needs
to peek into $ENV{HTTPS_PROXY}.

* mb/fetch-call-a-non-branch-a-ref (2012-04-17) 2 commits
 - fetch: describe new refs based on where it came from
 - fetch: Give remote_ref to update_local_ref() as well

Replacement to use the origin side to paint the message broke badly.

* mh/ref-api (2012-04-10) 13 commits
 - do_for_each_ref(): only iterate over the subtree that was requested
 - refs: store references hierarchically
 - sort_ref_dir(): simplify logic
 - refs.c: rename ref_array -> ref_dir
 - struct ref_entry: nest the value part in a union
 - check_refname_component(): return 0 for zero-length components
 - free_ref_entry(): new function
 - names_conflict(): simplify implementation
 - repack_without_ref(): reimplement using do_for_each_ref_in_array()
 - do_for_each_ref_in_arrays(): new function
 - do_for_each_ref_in_array(): new function
 - refs: manage current_ref within do_one_ref()
 - refs.c: reorder definitions more logically

Allows walking only a sub-hierarchy in refs/*.

Will merge to 'next'.

* jc/maint-blame-minimal (2012-04-11) 1 commit
 - blame: accept --need-minimal

"git blame" started missing quite a few changes from the origin since we
stopped using the diff minimalization by default in v1.7.2 era.

Will merge to 'next'.

* jk/repack-no-explode-objects-from-old-pack (2012-04-18) 4 commits
 - gc: use argv-array for sub-commands
 - argv-array: add a new "pushl" method
 - argv-array: refactor empty_argv initialization
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-04-15 at 7586e50)
 + gc: do not explode objects which will be immediately pruned

* ld/git-p4-tags-and-labels (2012-04-11) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-04-15 at 1b1e9a1)
 + git p4: import/export of labels to/from p4
 + git p4: Fixing script editor checks
 (this branch uses pw/git-p4.)

A review from Pete Wyckoff needs to be addressed.
Message-ID: <20120418113422.GB19994@padd.com>

* lt/octopus-simplify (2012-04-17) 3 commits
 - git-merge: Reduce heads before trying to merge them
 - Make 'git merge' simplify parents earlier
 - merge tests: octopus with redundant parents
 (this branch is tangled with jc/merge-reduce-parents-early.)

Octopus merge strategy did not reduce heads that are recorded in the final
commit, but follow-up broke badly.

* nh/empty-rebase (2012-04-18) 4 commits
 - git-rebase: add keep_empty flag
 - git-cherry-pick: add test to validate new options
 - git-cherry-pick: add "--keep-redundant-commits" option
 - git-cherry-pick: add allow-empty option

* sl/test-wc-l-line-count (2012-04-11) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-04-15 at 40797d9)
 + tests: modernise style: more uses of test_line_count

* zj/upstream-error-message (2012-04-15) 5 commits
 - i18n: mark @{upstream} error messages for translation
 - Be more specific if upstream branch is not tracked
 - Provide better message for barnhc_wiht_tpyo@{u}
 - Provide branch name in error message when using @{u}
 - t1507: add tests to document @{upstream} behaviour

Will merge to 'next'.

Will merge to 'next'.

* jh/apply-free-patch (2012-04-11) 9 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-04-15 at 8cccf57)
 + apply: document buffer ownership rules across functions
 + apply: tighten constness of line buffer
 + apply: drop unused macro
 + apply: free unused fragments for submodule patch
 + apply: free patch->result
 + apply: release memory for fn_table
 + apply: free patch->{def,old,new}_name fields
 + apply: rename free_patch() to free_patch_list()
 + apply: do not leak patches and fragments

Valgrind reports quite a lot of discarded memory inside apply.

* nd/threaded-index-pack (2012-04-11) 3 commits
 - index-pack: support multithreaded delta resolving
 - index-pack: split second pass obj handling into own function
 - compat/win32/pthread.h: Add an pthread_key_delete() implementation

J6t reports breakage on msysgit.

* bw/submodule-sed-solaris (2012-04-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-04-12 at 3bf1d83)
 + Avoid bug in Solaris xpg4/sed as used in submodule

Will merge to 'master'.

flight using curl-multi.

Will merge to 'next'.

* jk/rebase-i-submodule-conflict-only (2012-04-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-04-15 at 94367a8)
 + rebase -i continue: don't skip commits that only change submodules

Giving "--continue" to a conflicted "rebase -i" session skipped a commit
that only results in changes to submodules.

* ms/remote-usage-string (2012-04-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-04-15 at 704be8f)
 + remote: update builtin usage

As an independent follow-up, we may want to rethink how the overall usage
string and subcommand usage strings are maintained.

* pw/fast-import-dataref-parsing (2012-04-10) 1 commit
 - fast-import: tighten parsing of datarefs

Will merge to 'next'.

* pw/git-p4 (2012-04-09) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-04-15 at 81ea41a)
 + git p4: use "git p4" directly in tests
 + git p4: update name in script
 + git-p4: move to toplevel
 (this branch is used by ld/git-p4-tags-and-labels.)

* rl/show-empty-prefix (2012-04-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-04-15 at b2e5938)
 + rev-parse --show-prefix: add in trailing newline

* tr/xdiff-fast-hash (2012-04-09) 1 commit
 - xdiff: load full words in the inner loop of xdl_hash_record

Will merge to 'next'.

* jc/index-v4 (2012-04-04) 10 commits
 - update-index: upgrade/downgrade on-disk index version
 - read-cache.c: write prefix-compressed names in the index
 - read-cache.c: read prefix-compressed names in index on-disk version v4
 - read-cache.c: move code to copy incore to ondisk cache to a helper function
 - read-cache.c: move code to copy ondisk to incore cache to a helper function
 - read-cache.c: report the header version we do not understand
 - read-cache.c: make create_from_disk() report number of bytes it consumed
 - read-cache.c: allow unaligned mapping of the index file
 - cache.h: hide on-disk index details
 - varint: make it available outside the context of pack
 (this branch is tangled with jc/split-blob.)

Trivially shrinks the on-disk size of the index file to save both I/O and
checksum overhead.  The "v4" format represented here may not be what we
eventually want to have, but the preparatory refactoring steps and the way
how backward compatibility is retained should give plenty to learn to GSoC
student-hopefuls.

Will merge to 'next', if nobody objects.

* jc/push-upstream-sanity (2012-04-05) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-04-12 at 288e1ad)
 + push: error out when the "upstream" semantics does not make sense

Fix broken 'push to upstream' implementation.  "git push $there" without
refspec, when the current branch is set to push to a remote different from
$there, used to push to $there using the upstream information to a remote
unreleated to $there.

Will merge to 'master'.

* mk/gitweb-diff-hl (2012-04-11) 8 commits
 - gitweb: Refinement highlightning in combined diffs
 - gitweb: Highlight interesting parts of diff
 - gitweb: Push formatting diff lines to print_diff_chunk()

 - remote-curl: main test case for the OS command line overflow
 - fetch-pack: test cases for the new --stdin option
 - remote-curl: send the refs to fetch-pack on stdin
 - fetch-pack: new --stdin option to read refs from stdin

Will merge to 'next'.

* jn/debian-customizes-default-editor (2012-04-10) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-04-15 at 0fc85c3)
 + var doc: advertise current DEFAULT_PAGER and DEFAULT_EDITOR settings
 + var doc: default editor and pager are configurable at build time

* rs/commit-list-sort-in-batch (2012-04-17) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-04-17 at 21208e9)
 + mergesort: rename it to llist_mergesort()
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-04-15 at 39fe527)
 + revision: insert unsorted, then sort in prepare_revision_walk()
 + commit: use mergesort() in commit_list_sort_by_date()
 + add mergesort() for linked lists

* hv/submodule-recurse-push (2012-03-30) 3 commits
 - push: teach --recurse-submodules the on-demand option
 - Refactor submodule push check to use string list instead of integer
 - Teach revision walking machinery to walk multiple times sequencially

Will merge to 'next'.

* jk/run-command-eacces (2012-04-05) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-04-12 at ef3782e)
 + run-command: treat inaccessible directories as ENOENT
 + compat/mingw.[ch]: Change return type of exec functions to int

When PATH contains an unreadable directory, alias expansion code did not
kick in, and failed with an error that said "git-subcmd" was not found.

Will merge to 'master'.

* jb/am-include (2012-03-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-04-12 at ddbf96d)
 + am: support --include option

"git am" learned the "--include" option, which is an opposite of existing
the "--exclude" option.

Will merge to 'master'.

* jc/am-report-3way (2012-03-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-04-12 at cf5d599)
 + am -3: list the paths that needed 3-way fallback

When "git am -3" needs to fall back to an application to a synthesized
preimage followed by a 3-way merge, the paths that needed such treatment
are now reported to the end user, so that the result in them can be
eyeballed with extra care.

Will merge to 'master'.

* th/difftool-diffall (2012-04-14) 8 commits
 - difftool: print list of valid tools with '--tool-help'
 - difftool: teach difftool to handle directory diffs
 - difftool: eliminate setup_environment function
 - difftool: stop appending '.exe' to git
 - difftool: remove explicit change of PATH
 - difftool: exit(0) when usage is printed
 - difftool: add '--no-gui' option
 - difftool: parse options using Getopt::Long

Rolls the two-directory-diff logic from diffall script (in contrib/) into
"git difftool" framework. 

Still being reworked.

* ct/advise-push-default (2012-04-12) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-04-12 at b0613cd)
 + Fix httpd tests that broke when non-ff push advice changed
 + clean up struct ref's nonfastforward field
 + push: Provide situational hints for non-fast-forward errors

Breaks down the cases in which "git push" fails due to non-ff into three
categories, and gives separate advise messages.  This should be a good
change regardless of mm/push-default-switch-warning topic.

Will merge to 'master'.

* jc/run-hook-env-1 (2012-03-11) 1 commit
 - run_hook(): enhance the interface to pass arbitrary environment

Not urgent.

Updates run_hook() API to be much less specific to "commit".  It would
only be useful if people start doing more interesting things with hooks.

* mm/push-default-switch-warning (2012-04-15) 2 commits
 - t5570: use explicit push refspec
 - push: start warning upcoming default change for push.default

This resurrects an ancient patch I wrote during a discussion we had in the
1.6.3-1.6.4 era.  This should probably come after ct/advise-push-default
topic and at that point the advise messages need to be rephrased, taking
the future default change into account.

* jc/fmt-merge-msg-people (2012-03-13) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-04-12 at 4c2031c)
 + fmt-merge-msg: show those involved in a merged series

The "fmt-merge-msg" command learns to list the primary contributors
involved in the side topic you are merging.

Will merge to 'master'.
