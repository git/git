Subject: What's cooking in git.git (Sep 2014, #05; Fri, 19)

What's cooking in git.git (Sep 2014, #05; Fri, 19)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.

Many topics that have been cooking in 'next' are now in 'master'.

For some unknown reason, we ended up seeing that multiple people
simultaneously cooking topics that are all on the larger side
(i.e. dozen patches or more).  Inevitably larger topics tend to need
more rerolls, and they haven't really hit my tree quite yet, even
though many have been receiving and responding to reviews quite
actively.  Hopefully some may be able to hit 'next' by the end of
6th week of this cycle (i.e. early to mid October), or they would
have to wait until the next cycle.

On the 'maint' front, the first maintenance release for v2.1.x
series is out, downmerging the fixes that are already on 'master'
accumulated since v2.1.0.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

* ah/grammofix (2014-09-02) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-12 at 58fbb44)
 + grammofix in user-facing messages


* as/calloc-takes-nmemb-then-size (2014-09-03) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-12 at a287484)
 + calloc() and xcalloc() takes nmemb and then size

 Code clean-up.


* bb/date-iso-strict (2014-08-29) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-12 at c9d415d)
 + pretty: provide a strict ISO 8601 date format

 "log --date=iso" uses a slight variant of ISO 8601 format that is
 made more human readable.  A new "--date=iso-strict" option gives
 datetime output that is more strictly conformant.


* da/styles (2014-09-02) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-12 at a22322e)
 + stylefix: asterisks stick to the variable, not the type


* ir/makefile-typofix (2014-09-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-18 at bc1c273)
 + Makefile: fix some typos in the preamble


* jc/parseopt-verify-short-name (2014-09-04) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-12 at 43dba24)
 + parse-options: detect attempt to add a duplicate short option name

 Add checks for a common programming mistake to assign the same
 short option name to two separate options to help developers.


* jk/commit-author-parsing (2014-08-29) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-12 at cfbb6b6)
 + determine_author_info(): copy getenv output
 + determine_author_info(): reuse parsing functions
 + date: use strbufs in date-formatting functions
 + record_author_date(): use find_commit_header()
 + record_author_date(): fix memory leak on malformed commit
 + commit: provide a function to find a header in a buffer

 Code clean-up.


* jk/fast-export-anonymize (2014-08-28) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-12 at 0af10fa)
 + docs/fast-export: explain --anonymize more completely
 + teach fast-export an --anonymize option

 Sometimes users want to report a bug they experience on their
 repository, but they are not at liberty to share the contents of
 the repository.  "fast-export" was taught an "--anonymize" option
 to replace blob contents, names of people and paths and log
 messages with bland and simple strings to help them.


* jk/fsck-exit-code-fix (2014-09-12) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-18 at 34c696f)
 + fsck: return non-zero status on missing ref tips
 + fsck: exit with non-zero status upon error from fsck_obj()

 "git fsck" failed to report that it found corrupt objects via its
 exit status in some cases.


* jk/index-pack-threading-races (2014-08-29) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-12 at 9241312)
 + index-pack: fix race condition with duplicate bases

 When receiving an invalid pack stream that records the same object
 twice, multiple threads got confused due to a race.  We should
 reject or correct such a stream upon receiving, but that will be a
 larger change.


* jk/send-pack-many-refspecs (2014-08-26) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-12 at 7f4ae4e)
 + send-pack: take refspecs over stdin

 The number of refs that can be pushed at once over smart HTTP was
 limited by the command line length.  The limitation has been lifted
 by passing these refs from the standard input of send-pack.


* jp/index-with-corrupt-stages (2014-08-29) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-12 at 54016d5)
 + read_index_unmerged(): remove unnecessary loop index adjustment
 + read_index_from(): catch out of order entries when reading an index file

 A broken reimplementation of Git could write an invalid index that
 records both stage #0 and higher stage entries for the same path.
 Notice and reject such an index, as there is no sensible fallback
 (we do not know if the broken tool wanted to resolve and forgot to
 remove higher stage entries, or if it wanted to unresolve and
 forgot to remove the stage#0 entry).


* js/no-test-cmp-for-binaries (2014-09-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-15 at c5609e9)
 + t9300: use test_cmp_bin instead of test_cmp to compare binary files


* kb/perf-trace (2014-09-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-12 at 371df71)
 + trace: correct trace_strbuf() parameter type for !HAVE_VARIADIC_MACROS

 Compilation fix for some compilers.


* mb/build-contrib-svn-fe (2014-08-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-12 at acb252b)
 + contrib/svn-fe: fix Makefile


* mb/fast-import-delete-root (2014-08-29) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-12 at d0fda49)
 + fast-import: fix segfault in store_tree()
 + t9300: test filedelete command

 An attempt to remove the entire tree in the "git fast-import" input
 stream caused it to misbehave.


* mk/reachable-protect-detached-head (2014-09-03) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-12 at de2b50b)
 + reachable.c: add HEAD to reachability starting commits


* mr/mark-i18n-log-rerere (2014-09-15) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-15 at ba35eb3)

 + rerere.h: mark string for translation


* rs/export-strbuf-addchars (2014-09-08) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-12 at 8b25fe0)
 + strbuf: use strbuf_addchars() for adding a char multiple times
 + strbuf: export strbuf_addchars()

 Code clean-up.


* rs/merge-tree-simplify (2014-09-02) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-12 at 5b4c349)
 + merge-tree: remove unused df_conflict arguments

 Code clean-up.


* rs/more-uses-of-skip-prefix (2014-09-02) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-12 at 156a436)
 + pack-write: simplify index_pack_lockfile using skip_prefix() and xstrfmt()
 + connect: simplify check_ref() using skip_prefix() and starts_with()

 Code clean-up.


* rs/simplify-config-include (2014-09-02) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-12 at e4ffd6d)
 + config: simplify git_config_include()

 Code clean-up.


* rs/simplify-http-walker (2014-09-02) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-12 at b5178d2)
 + http-walker: simplify process_alternates_response() using strbuf

 Code clean-up.


* so/rebase-doc (2014-09-16) 1 commit

  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-15 at 11ec716)
 + Documentation: use single-parameter --cacheinfo in example


* ss/compat-default-source-for-newer-gnu (2014-09-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-15 at 0e87594)
 + compat-util: add _DEFAULT_SOURCE define


* ta/config-add-to-empty-or-true-fix (2014-09-11) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-15 at af779a7)
 + config: avoid a funny sentinel value "a^"
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-08-29 at d219212)
 + make config --add behave correctly for empty and NULL values

 "git config --add section.var val" used to lose existing
 section.var whose value was an empty string.


* tb/complete-diff-ignore-blank-lines (2014-09-03) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-12 at 1b7d259)
 + completion: Add --ignore-blank-lines for diff


* tb/crlf-tests (2014-09-02) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-12 at 2c950af)
 + MinGW: update tests to handle a native eol of crlf
 + Makefile: propagate NATIVE_CRLF to C

  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-18 at 6f8c9d7)
 + pre-push.sample: Write error message to stderr

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

 . refs.c: move the check for valid refname to lock_ref_sha1_basic
 . rename_ref: don't ask read_ref_full where the ref came from
 . refs.c: pass the ref log message to _create/delete/update instead of _commit

 . wrapper.c: add a new function unlink_or_msg
 . wrapper.c: remove/unlink_or_warn: simplify, treat ENOENT as success
 . mv test: recreate mod/ directory instead of relying on stale copy

 Rerolled and was asked to wait.  Seems to break HEAD reflog
 upon "checkout HEAD^0".

 Expecting another reroll.


* tr/remerge-diff (2014-09-08) 8 commits
 - log --remerge-diff: show what the conflict resolution changed

 - merge-recursive: remove dead conditional in update_stages()

 "log -p" output learns a new way to let users inspect a merge
 commit by showing the differences between the automerged result
 with conflicts the person who recorded the merge would have seen
 and the final conflict resolution that was recorded in the merge.

 Review comments sent.

 Hold, waiting for Karsten's replacement.


* cb/mergetool-difftool (2014-07-21) 2 commits
 - difftool: don't assume that default sh is sane
 - mergetool: don't require a work tree for --tool-help

 Update the way the "difftool --help" shows the help message that is
 shared with the "mergetool" to reduce one shell dependency.

 Will be rerolled.


* rr/mergetool-temporary-filename-tweak (2014-08-21) 1 commit
 - Allow the user to change the temporary file name for mergetool

 Needs rerolling (new paragraph in doc seems to be in a wrong place)

 - git-add--interactive: Preserve diff heading when splitting hunks

 Waiting for a reroll.


* jn/gitweb-utf8-in-links (2014-05-27) 1 commit
 - gitweb: Harden UTF-8 handling in generated links

 $gmane/250758?

* ss/userdiff-update-csharp-java (2014-06-02) 2 commits
 - userdiff: support Java try keyword
 - userdiff: support C# async methods and correct C# keywords

 Reviews sent; waiting for a response.


* bg/rebase-off-of-previous-branch (2014-04-16) 1 commit
 - git-rebase: print name of rev when using shorthand

 Teach "git rebase -" to report the concrete name of the branch
 (i.e. the previous one).

 But it stops short and does not do the same for "git rebase @{-1}".
 Expecting a reroll.


* jk/makefile (2014-02-05) 16 commits
 . FIXUP
 . move LESS/LV pager environment to Makefile
 . Makefile: teach scripts to include make variables
 . FIXUP
 . Makefile: auto-build C strings from make variables
 . Makefile: drop *_SQ variables
 . FIXUP
 . Makefile: add c-quote helper function
 . Makefile: introduce sq function for shell-quoting
 . Makefile: always create files via make-var
 . Makefile: store GIT-* sentinel files in MAKE/

 . Makefile: use tempfile/mv strategy for GIT-*
 . Makefile: introduce make-var helper function
 . Makefile: fix git-instaweb dependency on gitweb
 . Makefile: drop USE_GETTEXT_SCHEME from GIT-CFLAGS

 Simplify the Makefile rules and macros that exist primarily for
 quoting purposes, and make it easier to robustly express the
 dependency rules.

 Expecting a reroll.


* po/everyday-doc (2014-01-27) 1 commit
 - Make 'git help everyday' work

 This may make the said command to emit something, but the source is
 not meant to be formatted into a manual pages to begin with, and
 also its contents are a bit stale.  It may be a good first step in
 the right direction, but needs more work to at least get the
 mark-up right before public consumption.

 Waiting for a reroll (thread ending at $gmane/254746)


* rb/merge-prepare-commit-msg-hook (2014-01-10) 4 commits
 - merge: drop unused arg from abort_commit method signature
 - merge: make prepare_to_commit responsible for write_merge_state
 - t7505: ensure cleanup after hook blocks merge
 - t7505: add missing &&

 Expose more merge states (e.g. $GIT_DIR/MERGE_MODE) to hooks that
 run during "git merge".  The log message stresses too much on one
 hook, prepare-commit-msg, but it would equally apply to other hooks
 like post-merge, I think.

 Waiting for a reroll.


* jc/graph-post-root-gap (2013-12-30) 3 commits
 - WIP: document what we want at the end
 - graph: remove unused code a bit
 - graph: stuff the current commit into graph->columns[]

 This was primarily a RFH ($gmane/239580).

 - perf-lib: add test_perf_cleanup target
 - perf-lib: split starting the test from the execution

 Add test_perf_cleanup shell function to the perf suite, that allows
 the script writers to define a test with a clean-up action.

 Will hold.

 - show-branch: use commit slab to represent bitflags of arbitrary width
 - show-branch.c: remove "all_mask"
 - show-branch.c: abstract out "flags" operation
 - show-branch.c: lift all_mask/all_revs to a global static
 - show-branch.c: update comment style

 Waiting for the final step to lift the hard-limit before sending it out.

* jk/faster-name-conflicts (2014-09-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-19 at 34d2840)
 + refs: speed up is_refname_available

 Optimize the check to see if a ref $F can be created by making sure
 no existing ref has $F/ as its prefix, which especially matters in
 a repository with a large number of existing refs.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/write-packed-refs-via-stdio (2014-09-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-19 at f1e94fb)
 + refs: write packed_refs file using stdio

 Optimize the code path to write out the packed-refs file, which

 - refs: make rev-parse --quiet actually quiet
 - t1503: use test_must_be_empty
 - Documentation: a note about stdout for git rev-parse --verify --quiet

 "rev-parse --verify --quiet $name" is meant to quietly exit with a
 non-zero status when $name is not a valid object name, but still
 gave error messages in some cases.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* hj/pretty-naked-decoration (2014-09-18) 1 commit
 - pretty: add %D format specifier

 Will merge to 'next'.

 Some MUAs mangled a line in a message that begins with "From " to
 ">From " when writing to a mailbox file and feeding such an input
 to "git am" used to lose such a line.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/prune-packed-server-info (2014-09-15) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-19 at 5e6c398)

 + server-info: clean up after writing info/packs
 + make update-server-info more robust
 + prune-packed: fix minor memory leak

 Code cleanup.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* pr/use-default-sigpipe-setting (2014-09-18) 1 commit
 - unblock and unignore SIGPIPE

 We used to get confused when a process called us with SIGPIPE
 ignored; we do want to die with SIGPIPE when the output is not
 read by default, and do ignore the signal when appropriate.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* rs/realloc-array (2014-09-18) 2 commits
 - use REALLOC_ARRAY for changing the allocation size of arrays
 - add macro REALLOC_ARRAY

 Code cleanup.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/branch-verbose-merged (2014-09-18) 1 commit
 - branch: clean up commit flags after merge-filter walk

 Code cleanup.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 + hash-object: add --literally option
 + hash-object: pass 'write_object' as a flag
 + hash-object: reduce file-scope statics
 (this branch is used by jc/hash-object-fsck-tag.)

 "hash-object" learned a new "--literally" option to hash any random
 garbage into a loose object, to allow us to create a test data for
 mechanisms to catch corrupt objects.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jc/hash-object-fsck-tag (2014-09-12) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-19 at f14a7fe)
 + t1450: make sure fsck detects a malformed tagger line
 + Merge branch 'js/fsck-tag-validation' into HEAD
 (this branch uses jc/hash-object and js/fsck-tag-validation.)

 Using "hash-object --literally", test one of the new breakages
 js/fsck-tag-validation topic teaches "fsck" to catch is caught.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* js/fsck-tag-validation (2014-09-12) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-19 at 4a62182)

 + Make sure fsck_commit_buffer() does not run out of the buffer
 + fsck_object(): allow passing object data separately from the object itself
 + Refactor type_from_string() to allow continuing after detecting an error
 (this branch is used by jc/hash-object-fsck-tag.)

 tips of branches at a public repository really point the commits
 the pusher wanted to, without having to "trust" the server.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 Test-script clean-up.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* mt/patch-id-stable (2014-06-10) 1 commit
 - patch-id: change default to stable

 Teaches "git patch-id" to compute the patch ID that does not change
 when the files in a single patch is reordered. As this new algorithm
 is backward incompatible, the last bit to flip it to be the default
 is left out of 'master' for now.

 Nobody seems to be jumping up & down requesting this last step,
 which makes the result somewhat backward incompatible.
 Will perhaps drop.
