* hu/cherry-pick-previous-branch (2013-10-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-10-14 at 090934f)
 + cherry-pick: handle "-" after parsing options

 "git cherry-pick" without further options would segfault.

 Could use a follow-up to handle '-' after argv[1] better.


* jc/pack-objects (2013-02-04) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-10-14 at 8e8feb6)
 + pack-objects: shrink struct object_entry

  (merged to 'next' on 2013-10-14 at 270ef7b)
 + git-prompt.sh: optionally show upstream branch name

 An enhancement to the GIT_PS1_SHOWUPSTREAM facility.


* mg/more-textconv (2013-05-10) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-10-14 at 8a12490)

  (merged to 'next' on 2013-09-20 at 6a12786)
 + config doc: update dot-repository notes
 + doc: command line interface (cli) dot-repository dwimmery

 Explain how '.' can be used to refer to the "current repository"
 in the documentation.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* ap/remote-hg-unquote-cquote (2013-10-23) 1 commit
 - remote-hg: unquote C-style paths when exporting

 A fast-import stream expresses a pathname with funny characters by
 quoting them in C style; remote-hg remote helper forgot to unquote
 such a path.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jl/pack-transfer-avoid-double-close (2013-10-23) 1 commit
 - Clear fd after closing to avoid double-close error

 The codepath that send_pack() calls pack_objects() mistakenly
 closed the same file descriptor twice, leading to potentially
 closing a wrong file descriptor that was opened in the meantime.

 Will merge to 'next'.
 Needs to be merged later to 'maint'.


* nd/magic-pathspec (2013-10-22) 1 commit
 - Fix calling parse_pathspec with no paths nor PATHSPEC_PREFER_* flags

 All callers to parse_pathspec() must choose between getting no
 pathspec or one path that is limited to the current directory
 when there is no paths given on the command line, but there were
 two callers that violated this rule, triggering a BUG().

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sb/git-svn-docs-indent-with-ht (2013-10-22) 1 commit
 - git-svn docs: Use tabs consistently within the ascii doc

 Will merge to 'next'.


* tr/gitk-doc-update (2013-10-22) 1 commit
 - Documentation: revamp gitk(1)

 Will merge to 'next'.


* tr/valgrind-test-fix (2013-10-22) 2 commits
 - Revert "test-lib: allow prefixing a custom string before "ok N" etc."
 - Revert "test-lib: support running tests under valgrind in parallel"

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sb/repack-in-c (2013-10-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-10-23 at 5d7ac72)
 + Reword repack documentation to no longer state it's a script

 Finishing touches to update documentation.

 Will merge to 'master'.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* np/pack-v4 (2013-09-18) 90 commits
 - packv4-parse.c: add tree offset caching
 - t1050: replace one instance of show-index with verify-pack
 - index-pack, pack-objects: allow creating .idx v2 with .pack v4
 - unpack-objects: decode v4 trees
 - unpack-objects: allow to save processed bytes to a buffer
 - ...

 Nico and Duy advancing the eternal vaporware pack-v4.  This is here
 primarily for wider distribution of the preview edition.


* sc/doc-howto-dumb-http (2013-10-16) 1 commit
 . doc/howto: warn about (dumb)http server document being too old

 The new text needs to go somewhere in the body of the document,
 not before the title line.


* tg/perf-lib-test-perf-cleanup (2013-09-19) 2 commits
 - perf-lib: add test_perf_cleanup target
 - perf-lib: split starting the test from the execution

 Add test_perf_cleanup shell function to the perf suite, that allows
 the script writers to define a test with a clean-up action.

 Holding until needed.


* yt/shortened-rename (2013-10-18) 2 commits
 - SQUASH??? style fixes and s/omit/shorten/ where appropriate
 - diff.c: keep arrow(=>) on show_stats()'s shortened filename part to make rename visible

 Attempts to give more weight on the fact that a filepair represents
 a rename than showing substring of the actual path when diffstat
 lines are not wide enough.

 I am not sure if that is solving a right problem, though.


* tr/merge-recursive-index-only (2013-07-07) 3 commits
 - merge-recursive: -Xindex-only to leave worktree unchanged
 - merge-recursive: untangle double meaning of o->call_depth
 - merge-recursive: remove dead conditional in update_stages()

 Holding until there is a caller to learn from.


* jc/ref-excludes (2013-09-03) 2 commits
 - document --exclude option
 - revision: introduce --exclude=<glob> to tame wildcards

 People often wished a way to tell "git log --branches" (and "git
 log --remotes --not --branches") to exclude some local branches
 from the expansion of "--branches" (similarly for "--tags", "--all"
 and "--glob=<pattern>").  Now they have one.

 Needs a matching change to rev-parse.


* rv/send-email-cache-generated-mid (2013-08-21) 2 commits
 - git-send-email: Cache generated message-ids, use them when prompting
 - git-send-email: add optional 'choices' parameter to the ask sub


* rj/read-default-config-in-show-ref-pack-refs (2013-06-17) 3 commits
 - ### DONTMERGE: needs better explanation on what config they need
 - pack-refs.c: Add missing call to git_config()
 - show-ref.c: Add missing call to git_config()

 The changes themselves are probably good, but it is unclear what
 basic setting needs to be read for which exact operation.

 Waiting for clarification.
 $gmane/228294


* jh/shorten-refname (2013-05-07) 4 commits
 - t1514: refname shortening is done after dereferencing symbolic refs
 - shorten_unambiguous_ref(): Fix shortening refs/remotes/origin/HEAD to origin
 - t1514: Demonstrate failure to correctly shorten "refs/remotes/origin/HEAD"
 - t1514: Add tests of shortening refnames in strict/loose mode

 When remotes/origin/HEAD is not a symbolic ref, "rev-parse
 --abbrev-ref remotes/origin/HEAD" ought to show "origin", not
 "origin/HEAD", which is fixed with this series (if it is a symbolic
 ref that points at remotes/origin/something, then it should show
 "origin/something" and it already does).

 Expecting a reroll, as an early part of a larger series.
 $gmane/225137


* jc/format-patch (2013-04-22) 2 commits
 - format-patch: --inline-single
 - format-patch: rename "no_inline" field

 A new option to send a single patch to the standard output to be
 appended at the bottom of a message.  I personally have no need for
 this, but it was easy enough to cobble together.  Tests, docs and
 stripping out more MIMEy stuff are left as exercises to interested
 parties.


* jk/gitweb-utf8 (2013-04-08) 4 commits
 - gitweb: Fix broken blob action parameters on blob/commitdiff pages
 - gitweb: Don't append ';js=(0|1)' to external links
 - gitweb: Make feed title valid utf8
 - gitweb: Fix utf8 encoding for blob_plain, blobdiff_plain, commitdiff_plain, and patch

 Various fixes to gitweb.

 Drew Northup volunteered to take a look into this.
 $gmane/226216


* jc/show-branch (2013-06-07) 5 commits
 - show-branch: use commit slab to represent bitflags of arbitrary width
 - show-branch.c: remove "all_mask"
 - show-branch.c: abstract out "flags" operation
 - show-branch.c: lift all_mask/all_revs to a global static
 - show-branch.c: update comment style

 Waiting for the final step to lift the hard-limit before sending it out.

[Cooking]

* mm/checkout-auto-track-fix (2013-10-18) 2 commits
 - checkout: proper error message on 'git checkout foo bar --'
 - checkout: allow dwim for branch creation for "git checkout $branch --"

 "git checkout topic", when there is not yet a local "topic" branch
 but there is a unique remote-tracking branch for a remote "topic"
 branch, pretended as if "git checkout -t -b topic remote/$r/topic"
 (for that unique remote $r) was run. This hack however was not
 implemented for "git checkout topic --".

 Will merge to 'next'.


* hn/log-graph-color-octopus (2013-10-18) 1 commit
 - graph: fix coloring around octopus merges

 Will merge to 'next'.


* nd/gc-lock-against-each-other (2013-10-18) 1 commit
 - gc: remove gc.pid file at end of execution

 Will merge to 'next'.


* fc/styles (2013-10-16) 7 commits
 - block-sha1/sha1.c: have SP around arithmetic operators
 - base85.c: have SP around arithmetic operators
 - archive.c: have SP around arithmetic operators
 - alloc.c: have SP around arithmetic operators
 - abspath.c: have SP around arithmetic operators
 - alias: have SP around arithmetic operators
 - C: have space around && and || operators

 C coding style fixes.  The ones near the tip have not been sent to
 the list yet (they cover the same kind of style violation as the
 second one) and I should send them to the list.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/remote-literal-string-leakfix (2013-10-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-10-18 at 6abddac)
 + remote: do not copy "origin" string literal

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/split-broken-ident (2013-10-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-10-18 at 8f4b8b7)
 + split_ident: parse timestamp from end of line

 Make the fall-back parsing of commit objects with broken author or
 committer lines more robust to pick up the timestamps.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* sg/prompt-svn-remote-fix (2013-10-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-10-18 at 20b47eb)
 + bash prompt: don't use '+=' operator in show upstream code path

 Bash portability fix.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* sg/t3600-nul-sha1-fix (2013-10-16) 1 commit
 - t3600: fix broken "choking git rm" test

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ak/submodule-foreach-quoting (2013-09-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-10-14 at d77c5f1)
 + submodule foreach: skip eval for more than one argument

 A behavior change, but a worthwhile one: "git submodule foreach"
 was treating its arguments as part of a single command to be
 concatenated and passed to a shell, making writing buggy
 scripts too easy.

 This patch preserves the old "just pass it to the shell" behavior
 when a single argument is passed to 'git submodule foreach' and
 moves to a new "skip the shell and use the arguments passed
 unmolested" behavior when more than one argument is passed.

 The old behavior (always concatenating and passing to the shell)
 was similar to the 'ssh' command, while the new behavior (switching
 on the number of arguments) is what 'xterm -e' does.

 May need more thought to make sure this change is advertised well
 so that scripts that used multiple arguments but added their own
 extra layer of quoting are not broken.

 Will cook in 'next' for the rest of this cycle.


* ew/keepalive (2013-10-16) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-10-16 at 56fd9f3)
 + http: use curl's tcp keepalive if available
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-10-14 at 24d786f)
 + http: enable keepalive on TCP sockets

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/http-auth-redirects (2013-10-14) 9 commits
 - remote-curl: rewrite base url from info/refs redirects
 - remote-curl: store url as a strbuf
 - remote-curl: make refs_url a strbuf
 - http: update base URLs when we see redirects
 - http: provide effective url to callers
 - http: hoist credential request out of handle_curl_result
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-10-14 at a0642be)
 + http: refactor options to http_get_*
 + http_request: factor out curlinfo_strbuf
 + http_get_file: style fixes

 Handle the case where http transport gets redirected during the
 authorization request better.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jl/submodule-mv (2013-10-13) 1 commit
 - mv: Fix spurious warning when moving a file in presence of submodules

 Moving a regular file in a repository with a .gitmodules file was
 producing a warning 'Could not find section in .gitmodules where
 path=<filename>'.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* kb/fast-hashmap (2013-10-22) 12 commits
 - remove old hash.[ch] implementation
 - read-cache.c: fix memory leaks caused by removed cache entries
 - name-hash.c: remove cache entries instead of marking them CE_UNHASHED
 - name-hash.c: use new hash map implementation for cache entries
 - name-hash.c: remove unreferenced directory entries
 - name-hash.c: use new hash map implementation for directories
 - diffcore-rename.c: use new hash map implementation
 - diffcore-rename.c: simplify finding exact renames
 - diffcore-rename.c: move code around to prepare for the next patch
 - buitin/describe.c: use new hash map implementation
 - add a hashtable implementation that supports O(1) removal
 - submodule: don't access the .gitmodules cache entry after removing it

 Improvements to our hash table to get it to meet the needs of the
 msysgit fscache project, with some nice performance improvements.

 The preparatory clean-up to submodule from Jens is at the bottom. I
 also squashed in a fix-up by Karsten found at $gmane/236468 (please
 double-check the result).

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jc/revision-range-unpeel (2013-10-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-10-16 at d04ddfe)
 + revision: do not peel tags used in range notation

 "git rev-list --objects ^v1.0^ v1.0" gave v1.0 tag itself in the
 output, but "git rev-list --objects v1.0^..v1.0" did not.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/upload-pack-send-symref (2013-10-22) 10 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-10-23 at 8ef5660)
 + t5570: Update for clone-progress-to-stderr branch
 + Merge branch 'jk/clone-progress-to-stderr' into jc/upload-pack-send-symref
 + t5570: Update for symref capability
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-10-16 at eb1ae25)
 + clone: test the new HEAD detection logic
 + connect: annotate refs with their symref information in get_remote_head()
 + connect.c: make parse_feature_value() static
 + upload-pack: send non-HEAD symbolic refs
 + upload-pack: send symbolic ref information as capability
 + upload-pack.c: do not pass confusing cb_data to mark_our_ref()
 + t5505: fix "set-head --auto with ambiguous HEAD" test

 One long-standing flaw in the pack transfer protocol used by "git
 clone" was that there was no way to tell the other end which branch
 "HEAD" points at, and the receiving end needed to guess.  A new
 capability has been defined in the pack protocol to convey this
 information so that cloning from a repository with more than one
 branches pointing at the same commit where the HEAD is at now
 reliably sets the initial branch in the resulting repository.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jx/relative-path-regression-fix (2013-10-14) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-10-18 at b4af45f)
 + Use simpler relative_path when set_git_dir
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-10-14 at 704b9ee)
 + relative_path should honor dos-drive-prefix
 + test: use unambigous leading path (/foo) for MSYS

 Will merge to 'master' and later to 'maint'.

 Will merge to and cook in 'next' until Git 2.0.


* jc/add-2.0-ignore-removal (2013-04-22) 1 commit

 Updated endgame for "git add <pathspec>" that defaults to "--all"
 aka "--no-ignore-removal".
