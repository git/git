What's cooking in git.git (Mar 2020, #07; Sun, 22)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

Git 2.26 (final) has been tagged.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

 The directory traversal code had redundant recursive calls which
 made its performance characteristics exponential with respect to
 the depth of the tree, which was corrected.

 Expecting an update.

 updated to use "size_t".

 rewrite of "git rebase" in C, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.

* at/rebase-fork-point-regression-fix (2020-02-11) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-03-02 at a1a84d37a7)
 + rebase: --fork-point regression fix

 The "--fork-point" mode of "git rebase" regressed when the command
 was rewritten in C back in 2.20 era, which has been corrected.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* jc/describe-misnamed-annotated-tag (2020-02-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-03-02 at b4e2ca6a46)
 + describe: force long format for a name based on a mislocated tag

 When "git describe C" finds an annotated tag with tagname A to be
 the best name to explain commit C, and the tag is stored in a
 "wrong" place in the refs/tags hierarchy, e.g. refs/tags/B, the
 command gave a warning message but used A (not B) to describe C.
 If C is exactly at the tag, the describe output would be "A", but
 "git rev-parse A^0" would not be equal as "git rev-parse C^0".  The
 behavior of the command has been changed to use the "long" form
 i.e. A-0-gOBJECTNAME, which is correctly interpreted by rev-parse.

* hn/reftable (2020-02-26) 6 commits
 . Reftable support for git-core
 . Add reftable library
 . reftable: file format documentation
 . refs: document how ref_iterator_advance_fn should handle symrefs
 . create .git/refs in files-backend.c
 . refs.h: clarify reflog iteration order

 A new refs backend "reftable" to replace the traditional
 combination of packed-refs files and one-file-per-ref loose refs
 has been implemented and integrated for improved performance and
 atomicity.

 Temporarily ejected as this unfortunately conflicts with the
 SHA-256 topic.


* es/bugreport (2020-03-06) 6 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - bugreport: add compiler info
 - bugreport: add uname info
 - bugreport: gather git version and build info

 - help: move list_config_help to builtin/help

 The "bugreport" tool.

 As the scope of the topic got trimmed, hopefully these early parts
 can be polished quickly enough to be merged down.

* jc/rebase-backend-keep-old-default (2020-03-10) 1 commit
 . rebase: do not switch the default to 'merge' just yet

 The "merge" backend of "git rebase" still has a few bugs and
 unexpected behaviour that need to be ironed out before it becomes
 the default.  Let's switch the default back to the "apply" backend
 for now.
