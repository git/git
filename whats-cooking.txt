What's cooking in git.git (Dec 2019, #04; Tue, 17)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

The fifth batch of topics are now in 'master', on top of merging the
big security-related updates to the older maintenance tracks.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* rs/test-cleanup (2019-11-30) 7 commits

  (merged to 'next' on 2019-11-27 at 3258d51dfc)
 + sequencer: directly call pick_commits() from complete_action()
 + rebase: fill `squash_onto' in get_replay_opts()

 + parse-options.h: add new options `--pathspec-from-file`, `--pathspec-file-nul`
 (this branch is used by am/pathspec-f-f-checkout and es/pathspec-f-f-grep.)

 A few commands learned to take the pathspec from the
 standard input or a named file, instead of taking it as the command
 line arguments.

  (merged to 'next' on 2019-12-05 at 887d5559bb)
 + packfile.c: speed up loading lots of packfiles

 In a repository with many packfiles, the cost of the procedure that
 avoids registering the same packfile twice was unnecessarily high
 by using an inefficient search algorithm, which has been corrected.


* dd/time-reentrancy (2019-12-01) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-12-05 at d0c91f4d1b)

 + completion: complete `tformat:` pretty format
 + SubmittingPatches: remove dq from commit reference
 + pretty-formats.txt: use generic terms for hash
 + SubmittingPatches: use generic terms for hash

 "git log" family learned "--pretty=reference" that gives the name
 of a commit in the format that is often used to refer to it in log
 messages.


* dl/range-diff-with-notes (2019-12-06) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-12-10 at af8f441807)

  (merged to 'next' on 2019-12-05 at a164eccad1)
 + submodule: teach set-url subcommand

  (merged to 'next' on 2019-12-05 at 9252a4b1b6)
 + commit-graph: use start_delayed_progress()
 + progress: create GIT_PROGRESS_DELAY

 One kind of progress messages were always given during commit-graph
 generation, instead of following the "if it takes more than two
 seconds, show progress" pattern, which has been corrected.

 Hide lower-level verify_signed-buffer() API as a pure helper to
 implement the public check_signature() function, in order to
 encourage new callers to use the correct and more strict
 validation.

  (merged to 'next' on 2019-12-02 at 2b01214601)
 + send-pack: use OBJECT_INFO_QUICK to check negative objects

 Performance tweak on "git push" into a repository with many refs
 that point at objects we have never heard of.


* js/add-i-a-bit-more-tests (2019-12-06) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-12-10 at d7ffb75a43)

  (merged to 'next' on 2019-12-05 at 289f13054b)
 + mingw: forbid translating ERROR_SUCCESS to an errno value
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-12-02 at 798a952eca)
 + mingw: do set `errno` correctly when trying to restrict handle inheritance
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-11-27 at 4736894af6)
 + mingw: restrict file handle inheritance only on Windows 7 and later
 + mingw: spawned processes need to inherit only standard handles
 + mingw: work around incorrect standard handles
 + mingw: demonstrate that all file handles are inherited by child processes

 Work around a issue where a FD that is left open when spawning a
 child process and is kept open in the child can interfere with the
 operation in the parent process on Windows.

  (merged to 'next' on 2019-12-10 at 3a705a40d6)

* jt/clone-recursesub-ref-advise (2019-12-03) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-12-05 at fc071dddfe)
 + submodule--helper: advise on fatal alternate error
 + Doc: explain submodule.alternateErrorStrategy

 The interaction between "git clone --recurse-submodules" and
 alternate object store was ill-designed.  The documentation and
 code have been taught to make more clear recommendations when the
 users see failures.

  (merged to 'next' on 2019-12-02 at bd7fa24ad6)

 rebase" proper.


* rs/archive-zip-code-cleanup (2019-12-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-12-10 at 5a0b530805)

  (merged to 'next' on 2019-12-06 at e0522318ac)
 + xdiff: unignore changes in function context

 The "diff" machinery learned not to lose added/removed blank lines
 in the context when --ignore-blank-lines and --function-context are
 used at the same time.


* sg/assume-no-todo-update-in-cherry-pick (2019-11-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-11-27 at 6908186f85)
 + sequencer: don't re-read todo for revert and cherry-pick

 While running "revert" or "cherry-pick --edit" for multiple
 commits, a recent regression incorrectly detected "nothing to
 commit, working tree clean", instead of replaying the commits,
 which has been corrected.

  (merged to 'next' on 2019-12-02 at 4916f80e5e)

 + t9300-fast-import: don't hang if background fast-import exits too early
 + t9300-fast-import: store the PID in a variable instead of pidfile

 The test on "fast-import" used to get stuck when "fast-import" died
 in the middle.


* sg/test-squelch-noise-in-commit-bulk (2019-11-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-12-05 at 7819efee07)

  (merged to 'next' on 2019-12-05 at 466f07fb63)
 + perf-lib: use a single filename for all measurement types

 PerfTest fix to avoid stale result mixed up with the latest round
 of test results.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* pw/advise-rebase-skip (2019-12-06) 9 commits
 - rebase -i: leave CHERRY_PICK_HEAD when there are conflicts
 - rebase: fix advice when a fixup creates an empty commit
 - commit: give correct advice for empty commit during a rebase
 - commit: encapsulate determine_whence() for sequencer
 - commit: use enum value for multiple cherry-picks
 - sequencer: write CHERRY_PICK_HEAD for reword and edit
 - cherry-pick: check commit error messages
 - cherry-pick: add test for `--skip` advice in `git commit`
 - t3404: use test_cmp_rev

 The mechanism to prevent "git commit" from making an empty commit
 or amending during an interrupted cherry-pick was broken during the
 rewrite of "git rebase" in C, which has been corrected.

 Needs review.
 The tip two are still RFC.


* dl/format-patch-notes-config-fixup (2019-12-13) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-12-16 at e4da5b93bb)

  (merged to 'next' on 2019-12-10 at 2d8830090f)
 + format-patch: move git_config() before repo_init_revisions()
 + format-patch: use --notes behavior for format.notes
 + notes: extract logic into set_display_notes()
 + notes: create init_display_notes() helper
 + notes: rename to load_display_notes()

 "git format-patch" can take a set of configured format.notes values
 to specify which notes refs to use in the log message part of the
 output.  The behaviour of this was not consistent with multiple
 --notes command line options, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 - rebase: fix --fork-point with short refname

 The "--fork-point" mode of "git rebase" regressed when the command
 was rewritten in C back in 2.20 era, which has been corrected.

 Was waiting for discussion to settle.

 - builtin/config: die if "value_regex" doesn't canonicalize as boolean
 - builtin/config: warn if "value_regex" doesn't canonicalize as boolean
 - builtin/config: canonicalize "value_regex" with `--type=bool-or-int`
 - builtin/config: canonicalize "value_regex" with `--type=bool`
 - builtin/config: collect "value_regexp" data in a struct
 - builtin/config: extract `handle_value_regex()` from `get_value()`
 - t1300: modernize part of script
 - config: make `git_parse_maybe_bool_text()` public

 "git config" can be told to affect the existing entries that
 "match" the given value via its value_regex argument.  It learned
 to normalize the value set in the configuration and the value given
 from the command line before computing they "match", e.g. "true" in
 the configuration file can now match with "yes" given from the
 command line.

 Needs a bit more work?

* mt/threaded-grep-in-object-store (2019-10-02) 11 commits
 - grep: move driver pre-load out of critical section
 - grep: re-enable threads in non-worktree case
 - grep: protect packed_git [re-]initialization
 - grep: allow submodule functions to run in parallel
 - submodule-config: add skip_if_read option to repo_read_gitmodules()
 - grep: replace grep_read_mutex by internal obj read lock

 - replace-object: make replace operations thread-safe
 - grep: fix racy calls in grep_objects()
 - grep: fix race conditions at grep_submodule()
 - grep: fix race conditions on userdiff calls

 Traditionally, we avoided threaded grep while searching in objects
 (as opposed to files in the working tree) as accesses to the object
 layer is not thread-safe.  This limitation is getting lifted.

 Expecting a reroll.

 The transport layer has been updated so that the protocol version

 listing the protocol versions it is willing to talk, and the other
 side choosing from one of them.
