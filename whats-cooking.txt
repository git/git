What's cooking in git.git (Aug 2020, #06; Mon, 24)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'seen' (formerly 'pu'---proposed updates) while commits prefixed
with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches of the
repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to 'master']

* dl/subtree-docs (2020-08-18) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-19 at e1a8ea9d46)
 + contrib/subtree: document 'push' does not take '--squash'
 + contrib/subtree: fix "unsure" for --message in the document

 Doc updates for subtree (in contrib/)


* ds/midx-repack-to-batch-size (2020-08-11) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-17 at eee94634aa)
 + multi-pack-index: repack batches below --batch-size

 The "--batch-size" option of "git multi-pack-index repack" command
 is now used to specify that very small packfiles are collected into
 one until the total size roughly exceeds it.


* en/dir-clear (2020-08-18) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-19 at 18c5b69293)
 + dir: fix problematic API to avoid memory leaks
 + dir: make clear_directory() free all relevant memory

 Leakfix with code clean-up.


* en/dir-nonbare-embedded (2020-08-12) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-17 at ab180b7fcb)
 + dir: avoid prematurely marking nonbare repositories as matches
 + t3000: fix some test description typos

 "ls-files -o" mishandled the top-level directory of another git
 working tree that hangs in the current git working tree.


* es/init-no-separate-git-dir-in-bare (2020-08-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-17 at 80498c8659)
 + init: disallow --separate-git-dir with bare repository

 The purpose of "git init --separate-git-dir" is to initialize a
 new project with the repository separate from the working tree,
 or, in the case of an existing project, to move the repository
 (the .git/ directory) out of the working tree. It does not make
 sense to use --separate-git-dir with a bare repository for which
 there is no working tree, so disallow its use with bare
 repositories.


* jc/no-update-fetch-head (2020-08-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-19 at 68e1374ed6)
 + fetch: optionally allow disabling FETCH_HEAD update
 (this branch is used by ds/maintenance-part-1, ds/maintenance-part-2 and jt/lazy-fetch.)

 "git fetch" learned --no-write-fetch-head option to avoid writing
 the FETCH_HEAD file.


* jk/unleak-fixes (2020-08-13) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-17 at f9bd296b25)
 + ls-remote: simplify UNLEAK() usage
 + stop calling UNLEAK() before die()

 Fix some incorrect UNLEAK() annotations.


* ma/doc-sha-256-is-experimental (2020-08-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-19 at 9ccf6c399c)
 + Documentation: mark `--object-format=sha256` as experimental

 The recent addition of SHA-256 support is marked as experimental in
 the documentation.


* mt/checkout-entry-dead-code-removal (2020-08-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-19 at 58866e5299)
 + checkout_entry(): remove unreachable error() call

 Code clean-up.


* rs/more-buffered-io (2020-08-17) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-19 at 6d23a23bb2)
 + upload-pack: use buffered I/O to talk to rev-list
 + midx: use buffered I/O to talk to pack-objects
 + connected: use buffered I/O to talk to rev-list

 Use more buffered I/O where we used to call many small write(2)s.


* rs/patch-id-with-incomplete-line (2020-08-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-19 at 72961d48d0)
 + patch-id: ignore newline at end of file in diff_flush_patch_id()

 The patch-id computation did not ignore the "incomplete last line"
 marker like whitespaces.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* jk/refspecs-cleanup (2020-08-17) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-24 at 807a080ebf)
 + refspec: make sure stack refspec_item variables are zeroed
 + refspec: fix documentation referring to refspec_item
 (this branch is used by jk/refspecs-negative.)

 Preliminary code clean-up before introducing "negative refspec".

 Will merge to 'master'.


* rs/checkout-no-overlay-pathspec-fix (2020-08-22) 1 commit
 - checkout, restore: make pathspec recursive

 "git restore/checkout --no-overlay" with wildcarded pathspec
 mistakenly removed matching paths in subdirectories, which has been
 corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* al/bisect-first-parent (2020-08-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-24 at f95fbf45a6)
 + bisect: add first-parent option to documentation

 Finishing touches.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* js/no-builtins-on-disk-option (2020-08-24) 3 commits
 - ci: stop linking built-ins to the dashed versions
 - install: optionally skip linking/copying the built-ins
 - msvc: copy the correct `.pdb` files in the Makefile target `install`

 The installation procedure learned to optionally omit "git-foo"
 executable files for each 'foo' built-in subcommand, which are only
 required by old timers that still rely on the age old promise that
 prepending "git --exec-path" output to PATH early in their script
 will keep the "git-foo" calls they wrote working.

 The old attempt to remove these executables from the disk failed in
 the 1.6 era; it may be worth attempting again, but I think it is
 worth to keep this topic separate from such a policy change to help
 it graduate early.

 cf. https://public-inbox.org/git/7vprnzt7d5.fsf@gitster.siamese.dyndns.org/


* jt/threaded-index-pack (2020-08-24) 8 commits
 - fixup! index-pack: make quantum of work smaller
 - index-pack: make quantum of work smaller
 - index-pack: make resolve_delta() assume base data
 - index-pack: calculate {ref,ofs}_{first,last} early
 - index-pack: remove redundant child field
 - index-pack: unify threaded and unthreaded code
 - index-pack: remove redundant parameter
 - Documentation: deltaBaseCacheLimit is per-thread

 "git index-pack" learned to resolve deltified objects with greater
 parallelism.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* mt/grep-sparse-checkout (2020-06-12) 6 commits
 - config: add setting to ignore sparsity patterns in some cmds
 - grep: honor sparse checkout patterns
 - config: correctly read worktree configs in submodules
 - t/helper/test-config: facilitate addition of new cli options
 - t/helper/test-config: return exit codes consistently
 - doc: grep: unify info on configuration variables

 "git grep" has been tweaked to be limited to the sparse checkout
 paths.

 Review needed on 4/6; otherwise looking sane.
 cf. <CABPp-BGdEyEeajYZj_rdxp=MyEQdszuyjVTax=hhYj3fOtRQUQ@mail.gmail.com>


* ls/mergetool-meld-auto-merge (2020-07-12) 2 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - Support auto-merge for meld to follow the vim-diff behavior

 The 'meld' backend of the "git mergetool" learned to give the
 underlying 'meld' the '--auto-merge' option, which would help
 reduce the amount of text that requires manual merging.

 Expecting a reroll.


* mf/submodule-summary-with-correct-repository (2020-06-24) 2 commits
 - submodule: use submodule repository when preparing summary
 - revision: use repository from rev_info when parsing commits

 "git diff/show" on a change that involves a submodule used to read
 the information on commits in the submodule from a wrong repository
 and gave a wrong information when the commit-graph is involved.

 Needs tests.


* dr/push-remoteref-fix (2020-04-23) 1 commit
 - remote.c: fix handling of %(push:remoteref)

 The "%(push:remoteref)" placeholder in the "--format=" argument of
 "git format-patch" (and friends) only showed what got explicitly
 configured, not what ref at the receiving end would be updated when
 "git push" was used, as it ignored the default behaviour (e.g. update
 the same ref as the source).

 Expecting a reroll.
 cf. <20200416152145.wp2zeibxmuyas6y6@feanor>


* mr/bisect-in-c-2 (2020-07-17) 14 commits
 . SQUASH??? do not add new users of git_path_bisect_head()
 . bisect--helper: retire `--bisect-autostart` subcommand
 . bisect--helper: retire `--write-terms` subcommand
 . bisect--helper: retire `--check-expected-revs` subcommand
 . bisect--helper: reimplement `bisect_state` & `bisect_head` shell functions in C
 . bisect--helper: retire `--next-all` subcommand
 . bisect--helper: retire `--bisect-clean-state` subcommand
 . bisect--helper: finish porting `bisect_start()` to C
 . bisect--helper: reimplement `bisect_next` and `bisect_auto_next` shell functions in C
 . bisect: call 'clear_commit_marks_all()' in 'bisect_next_all()'
 . bisect--helper: reimplement `bisect_autostart` shell function in C
 . bisect--helper: introduce new `write_in_file()` function
 . bisect--helper: use '-res' in 'cmd_bisect__helper' return
 . bisect--helper: BUG() in cmd_*() on invalid subcommand

 Rewrite of the remainder of "git bisect" script in C continues.

 Needs more work.
 Ejected out of 'seen'; al/bisect-first-parent topic has a bit of
 textual conflict with this topic.


* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2018-10-15) 1 commit
 - zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* hn/refs-pseudorefs (2020-08-21) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-24 at 3579abe8ff)
 + sequencer: treat REVERT_HEAD as a pseudo ref
 + builtin/commit: suggest update-ref for pseudoref removal
 + sequencer: treat CHERRY_PICK_HEAD as a pseudo ref
 + refs: make refs_ref_exists public
 (this branch uses hn/refs-fetch-head-is-special.)

 Accesses to two pseudorefs have been updated to properly use ref
 API.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* rz/complete-more-options (2020-08-19) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-21 at ba8f4c8cb1)
 + completion: add GIT_COMPLETION_SHOW_ALL env var
 + parse-options: add --git-completion-helper-all

 Command line completion (in contrib/) usually omits redundant,
 deprecated and/or dangerous options from its output; it learned to
 optionally include all of them.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jt/promisor-pack-fix (2020-08-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-24 at cd26d30d8d)
 + fetch-pack: in partial clone, pass --promisor

 Updates into a lazy/partial clone with a submodule did not work
 well with transfer.fsckobjects set.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* hv/ref-filter-trailers-atom-parsing-fix (2020-08-21) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-24 at 79b27f3263)
 + ref-filter: 'contents:trailers' show error if `:` is missing
 + t6300: unify %(trailers) and %(contents:trailers) tests

 The parser for "git for-each-ref --format=..." was too loose when
 parsing the "%(trailers...)" atom, and forgot that "trailers" and
 "trailers:<modifers>" are the only two allowed forms, which has
 been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/ident-whose-ident (2020-08-21) 1 commit
 - ident: say whose identity is missing when giving user.name hint

 Error message update.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/index-pack-w-more-threads (2020-08-21) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-24 at 18f18a5b66)
 + index-pack: adjust default threading cap
 + p5302: count up to online-cpus for thread tests
 + p5302: disable thread-count parameter tests by default

 Long ago, we decided to use 3 threads by default when running the
 index-pack task in parallel, which has been adjusted a bit upwards.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* rp/apply-cached-doc (2020-08-20) 1 commit
 - git-apply.txt: update descriptions of --cached, --index

 The description of --cached/--index options in "git apply --help"
 has been updated.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* dd/diff-customize-index-line-abbrev (2020-08-21) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-24 at 74e842a2c8)
 + diff: index-line: respect --abbrev in object's name
 + t4013: improve diff-post-processor logic

 The output from the "diff" family of the commands had abbreviated
 object names of blobs involved in the patch, but its length was not
 affected by the --abbrev option.  Now it is.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* hn/refs-fetch-head-is-special (2020-08-19) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-21 at def233ab43)
 + refs: read FETCH_HEAD and MERGE_HEAD generically
 + refs: move gitdir into base ref_store
 + refs: fix comment about submodule ref_stores
 + refs: split off reading loose ref data in separate function
 (this branch is used by hn/refs-pseudorefs.)

 The FETCH_HEAD is now always read from the filesystem regardless of
 the ref backend in use, as its format is much richer than the
 normal refs, and written directly by "git fetch" as a plain file..

 Will merge to 'master'.


* hv/ref-filter-misc (2020-08-17) 9 commits
 - ref-filter: add `sanitize` option for 'subject' atom
 - format-support: move `format_sanitized_subject()` from pretty
 - pretty: refactor `format_sanitized_subject()`
 - ref-filter: add `short` modifier to 'parent' atom
 - ref-filter: add `short` modifier to 'tree' atom
 - ref-filter: rename `objectname` related functions and fields
 - ref-filter: modify error messages in `grab_objectname()`
 - ref-filter: refactor `grab_objectname()`
 - ref-filter: support different email formats

 The "--format=" option to the "for-each-ref" command and friends
 learned a few more tricks, e.g. the ":short" suffix that applies to
 "objectname" now also can be used for "parent", "tree", etc.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/leakfix (2020-08-17) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-21 at a8b25a2657)
 + submodule--helper: fix leak of core.worktree value
 + config: fix leak in git_config_get_expiry_in_days()
 + config: drop git_config_get_string_const()
 + config: fix leaks from git_config_get_string_const()
 + checkout: fix leak of non-existent branch names

 (this branch uses jk/refspecs-cleanup.)

 "negative refspecs"


* jt/fetch-pack-loosen-validation-with-packfile-uri (2020-08-14) 1 commit
 - fetch-pack: make packfile URIs work with transfer.fsckobjects

 Bugfix for "git fetch" when the packfile URI capability is in use.

 Need to pick up a reroll.


* mr/diff-hide-stat-wo-textual-change (2020-08-19) 1 commit
 - diff: teach --stat to ignore uninteresting modifications

 "git diff --stat -w" showed 0-line changes for paths whose changes
 were only whitespaces, which was not intuitive.  We now omit such
 paths from the stat output.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* pw/add-p-allowed-options-fix (2020-08-17) 2 commits
 - add -p: fix checking of user input
 - add -p: use ALLOC_GROW_BY instead of ALLOW_GROW

 "git add -p" update.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* en/mem-pool (2020-08-18) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-19 at eff9ad46f0)
 + mem-pool: use consistent pool variable name
 + mem-pool: use more standard initialization and finalization
 + mem-pool: add convenience functions for strdup and strndup

 API update.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jt/lazy-fetch (2020-08-18) 7 commits
 - fetch-pack: remove no_dependents code
 - promisor-remote: lazy-fetch objects in subprocess
 - fetch-pack: do not lazy-fetch during ref iteration
 - fetch: only populate existing_refs if needed
 - fetch: avoid reading submodule config until needed
 - fetch: allow refspecs specified through stdin
 - negotiator/noop: add noop fetch negotiator

 Updates to on-demand fetching code in lazily cloned repositories.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 - doc: add documentation for the proc-receive hook
 - transport: parse report options for tracking refs
 - t5411: test updates of remote-tracking branches

 - receive-pack: feed report options to post-receive
 - receive-pack: add new proc-receive hook
 - t5411: add basic test cases for proc-receive hook
 - transport: not report a non-head push as a branch

 "git receive-pack" that accepts requests by "git push" learned to
 outsource most of the ref updates to the new "proc-receive" hook.


* pw/rebase-i-more-options (2020-08-19) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-21 at ade71fd49b)
 + rebase: add --reset-author-date
 + rebase -i: support --ignore-date
 + rebase -i: support --committer-date-is-author-date
 + am: stop exporting GIT_COMMITTER_DATE
 + rebase -i: add --ignore-whitespace flag

 "git rebase -i" learns a bit more options.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 - t4216: use an '&&'-chain
 - commit-graph: introduce 'get_bloom_filter_settings()'

 Misc Bloom filter improvements.

 Expecting a reroll.
 It seems that the review is getting closer to result in another update.
 cf. <20200811220503.GC66656@syl.lan>

 (this branch uses ds/maintenance-part-1.)

 "git maintenance", an extended big brother of "git gc", continues
 to evolve.


* ss/submodule-summary-in-c (2020-08-12) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-17 at 9bc352cb70)
 + submodule: port submodule subcommand 'summary' from shell to C
 + t7421: introduce a test script for verifying 'summary' output
 + submodule: rename helper functions to avoid ambiguity

 (this branch is used by ds/maintenance-part-2.)

 A "git gc"'s big brother has been introduced to take care of more
 repository maintenance tasks, not limited to the object database
 cleaning.

 Comments?


* es/config-hooks (2020-07-30) 6 commits
 - hook: add 'run' subcommand
 - parse-options: parse into argv_array
 - hook: add --porcelain to list command
 - hook: add list command
 - hook: scaffolding for git-hook subcommand
 - doc: propose hooks managed by the config

 The "hooks defined in config" topic.

 Expecting a reroll.
 Now jk/strvec is in 'master', we may want to see the topic reworked
 on top of it.  Are there unresolved issues, or does the topic need
 a round of detailed review?

 hash_to_hex() used a set of rotating static buffers, which was not
 safe to use in a threaded environment.  This has been made safer by
