What's cooking in git.git (Nov 2013, #02; Wed, 6)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.

The first release candidate 1.8.5-rc1 has been tagged.

As promised/requested, the final steps for 2.0 are in 'next'; they,
together with a handful topics that have been merged to 'next'
fairly recently, will _not_ be part of the upcoming 1.8.5 release,
but will be carried over in 'next' to the next cycle.

There is a proposed rewording of advice message from "git push"
patch, which is tentatively queued near the tip of 'pu' for now; it
would be nice to get a few more sets of eyeballs.  I am not sure if
we should merge it before the 1.8.5 final, yet (we have i18n to
worry about, among other things).

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

 An ancient How-To on serving Git repositories on an HTTP server
 lacked a warning that it has been mostly superseded with more
 modern way.

  (merged to 'next' on 2013-11-06 at 7b45219)
 + Rename suffixcmp() to has_suffix() and invert its result
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-11-04 at 6408502)
 + builtin/remote: remove postfixcmp() and use suffixcmp() instead

 Minor code clean-up.

 Can wait in 'next'.


* tb/clone-ssh-with-colon-for-port (2013-11-04) 1 commit
 . git clone: is an URL local or ssh

 Still being reworked.


* cn/thin-push-capability (2013-11-06) 2 commits
 - send-pack: only send a thin pack if the server supports it
 - receive-pack: advertise thin-pack

 Peff had a good suggestion to control this by expressing what the
 receiving end wants in a more direct way, namely to advertise a
 'no-thin' trait in the capability list.


* nd/wt-status-align-i18n (2013-11-06) 1 commit
 - wt-status: take the alignment burden off translators

 An attempt to automatically align the names in the "git status"
 output, taking the display width of (translated) section labels
 into account.


* nv/commit-gpgsign-config (2013-11-06) 1 commit
 - Add the commit.gpgsign option to sign all commits

 Introduce commit.gpgsign configuration variable to force every
 commit to be GPG signed.

 Needs tests, perhaps?


* sb/sha1-loose-object-info-check-existence (2013-11-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-11-06 at 1ea5b18)
 + sha1_loose_object_info(): do not return success on missing object

 "git cat-file --batch-check=ok" did not check the existence of the
 named object.

 Will merge to 'next', but I think this can wait in 'next' during
 the feature freeze.

* gj/push-more-verbose-advice (2013-11-06) 2 commits
 - push: switch default from "matching" to "simple"
 - push: Enhance unspecified push default warning

 Explain 'simple' and 'matching' in "git push" advice message; the
 topmost patch is a rebase of jc/push-2.0-default-to-simple on top
 of it.

[Stalled]

* np/pack-v4 (2013-09-18) 90 commits
 . packv4-parse.c: add tree offset caching
 . t1050: replace one instance of show-index with verify-pack
 . index-pack, pack-objects: allow creating .idx v2 with .pack v4
 . unpack-objects: decode v4 trees

 - ...

 Nico and Duy advancing the eternal vaporware pack-v4.  This is here
 primarily for wider distribution of the preview edition.

 Temporarily ejected from 'pu', to try out jk/pack-bitmap, which
 this topic conflicts with.


* mf/graph-show-root (2013-10-25) 1 commit
 . graph.c: mark root commit differently

 In a repository with multiple-roots, "log --graph", especially with
 "--oneline", does not give the reader enough visual cue to see
 where one line of history ended and a separate history began.

 This is the version that marks the roots 'x' when they would have
 been marked as '*'; Keshav Kini suggested an alternative of giving
 an extra blank line after every root, which I tend to think is a
 better approach to the problem.


* tg/perf-lib-test-perf-cleanup (2013-09-19) 2 commits
 - perf-lib: add test_perf_cleanup target
 - perf-lib: split starting the test from the execution

 Add test_perf_cleanup shell function to the perf suite, that allows
 the script writers to define a test with a clean-up action.

 Holding until needed.


* yt/shortened-rename (2013-10-18) 2 commits
 - SQUASH??? style fixes and s/omit/shorten/ where appropriate
 - diff.c: keep arrow(=>) on show_stats()'s shortened filename part to make rename visible

 Attempts to give more weight on the fact that a filepair represents
 a rename than showing substring of the actual path when diffstat
 lines are not wide enough.

 I am not sure if that is solving a right problem, though.


* rv/send-email-cache-generated-mid (2013-08-21) 2 commits
 - git-send-email: Cache generated message-ids, use them when prompting
 - git-send-email: add optional 'choices' parameter to the ask sub


* rj/read-default-config-in-show-ref-pack-refs (2013-06-17) 3 commits
 - ### DONTMERGE: needs better explanation on what config they need
 - pack-refs.c: Add missing call to git_config()
 - show-ref.c: Add missing call to git_config()

 The changes themselves are probably good, but it is unclear what
 basic setting needs to be read for which exact operation.

 Waiting for clarification.
 $gmane/228294


* jc/format-patch (2013-04-22) 2 commits
 - format-patch: --inline-single
 - format-patch: rename "no_inline" field

 A new option to send a single patch to the standard output to be
 appended at the bottom of a message.  I personally have no need for
 this, but it was easy enough to cobble together.  Tests, docs and
 stripping out more MIMEy stuff are left as exercises to interested
 parties.


* jk/gitweb-utf8 (2013-04-08) 4 commits
 - gitweb: Fix broken blob action parameters on blob/commitdiff pages
 - gitweb: Don't append ';js=(0|1)' to external links
 - gitweb: Make feed title valid utf8
 - gitweb: Fix utf8 encoding for blob_plain, blobdiff_plain, commitdiff_plain, and patch

 Various fixes to gitweb.

 Drew Northup volunteered to take a look into this.

* jc/show-branch (2013-06-07) 5 commits
 - show-branch: use commit slab to represent bitflags of arbitrary width
 - show-branch.c: remove "all_mask"
 - show-branch.c: abstract out "flags" operation
 - show-branch.c: lift all_mask/all_revs to a global static
 - show-branch.c: update comment style

 + t1005: add test for "read-tree --reset -u A B"
 + t1005: reindent
 + unpack-trees: fix "read-tree -u --reset A B" with conflicted index

 Fix a rather longstanding corner-case bug in twoway "reset to
 there" merge, which is most often seen in "git am --abort".

 Will cook in 'next'.


* jc/ref-excludes (2013-11-01) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-11-04 at fac1ed0)
 + rev-parse: introduce --exclude=<glob> to tame wildcards
 + rev-list --exclude: export add/clear-ref-exclusion and ref-excluded API
 + rev-list --exclude: tests
 + document --exclude option
 + revision: introduce --exclude=<glob> to tame wildcards

 People often wished a way to tell "git log --branches" (and "git
 log --remotes --not --branches") to exclude some local branches
 from the expansion of "--branches" (similarly for "--tags", "--all"
 and "--glob=<pattern>").  Now they have one.

 Can wait in 'next'.


* jk/replace-perl-in-built-scripts (2013-10-29) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-11-01 at 2384e29)
 + use @@PERL@@ in built scripts

 Can wait in 'next'.


* jt/commit-fixes-footer (2013-10-30) 1 commit
 - commit: Add -f, --fixes <commit> option to add Fixes: line

 There is an ongoing discussion around this topic; in general I am
 fairly negative on a new feature that is too narrow and prefer a
 more generic solution that can be tailored for specific needs, as
 many people stated in the thread.


* fc/transport-helper-fixes (2013-11-06) 12 commits
 - transport-helper: demote lack of "force" option to a warning
 - transport-helper: add support to delete branches
 - fast-export: add support to delete refs
 - fast-import: add support to delete refs
 - transport-helper: add support for old:new refspec
 - fixup! fast-export: add new --refspec option
 - fast-export: add new --refspec option
 - fast-export: improve argument parsing
 - transport-helper: check for 'forced update' message
 - transport-helper: add 'force' to 'export' helpers
 - transport-helper: don't update refs in dry-run
 - transport-helper: mismerge fix

 Updates transport-helper, fast-import and fast-export to allow the
 ref mapping and ref deletion in a way similar to the natively
 supported transports.

 Expecting a reroll to fix use of vla.


* jh/loose-object-dirs-creation-race (2013-10-28) 1 commit

  (merged to 'next' on 2013-11-01 at 1a91775)
 + pathspec: stop --*-pathspecs impact on internal parse_pathspec() uses

 Will cook in 'next'.


* th/reflog-annotated-tag (2013-10-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-11-01 at 8b154cc)
 + reflog: handle lightweight and annotated tags equally

 "git log -g $annotated_tag", when there is no reflog history, should
 have produced a single output entry (i.e. the ref creation event),
 but instead showed the history leading to the tag.

 Broken at the design level.  Any reflog entry that points at a non
 commit needs to be handled with new code that does not exist yet,
 and lifting the "this code handles only commits" without adding
 such code does not solve anything.


* tr/merge-recursive-index-only (2013-10-28) 3 commits
 - merge-recursive: -Xindex-only to leave worktree unchanged
 - merge-recursive: internal flag to avoid touching the worktree
 - merge-recursive: remove dead conditional in update_stages()

 Will hold until using script appears.


* bc/http-100-continue (2013-10-31) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-11-01 at e12ae23)
 + remote-curl: fix large pushes with GSSAPI
 + remote-curl: pass curl slot_results back through run_slot
 + http: return curl's AUTHAVAIL via slot_results

 Issue "100 Continue" responses to help use of GSS-Negotiate
 authentication scheme over HTTP transport when needed.

* jc/merge-base-reflog (2013-10-29) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-11-01 at 6114764)
 + merge-base: teach "--fork-point" mode
 + merge-base: use OPT_CMDMODE and clarify the command line parsing

 Code the logic in "pull --rebase" that figures out a fork point
 from reflog entries in C.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* jk/pack-bitmap (2013-10-30) 20 commits
 - count-objects: recognize .bitmap in garbage-checking
 - pack-bitmap: implement optional name_hash cache
 - t: add basic bitmap functionality tests
 - repack: consider bitmaps when performing repacks

 - pack-bitmap: add support for bitmap indexes
 - documentation: add documentation for the bitmap format

 - revision: allow setting custom limiter function
 - pack-objects: factor out name_hash

 - revindex: export new APIs
 - sha1write: make buffer const-correct

 Borrows the bitmap index into packfiles from JGit to speed up

* mh/fetch-tags-in-addition-to-normal-refs (2013-10-30) 23 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-11-06 at 6932893)
 + fetch: improve the error messages emitted for conflicting refspecs
 + handle_duplicate(): mark error message for translation
 + ref_remote_duplicates(): extract a function handle_duplicate()
 + ref_remove_duplicates(): simplify loop logic
 + t5536: new test of refspec conflicts when fetching

 + git-fetch.txt: improve description of tag auto-following
 + fetch-options.txt: simplify ifdef/ifndef/endif usage
 + fetch, remote: properly convey --no-prune options to subprocesses
 + builtin/remote.c:update(): use struct argv_array
 + builtin/remote.c: reorder function definitions
 + query_refspecs(): move some constants out of the loop
 + fetch --prune: prune only based on explicit refspecs
 + fetch --tags: fetch tags *in addition to* other stuff
 + fetch: only opportunistically update references based on command line
 + get_expanded_map(): avoid memory leak
 + get_expanded_map(): add docstring
 + builtin/fetch.c: reorder function definitions
 + get_ref_map(): rename local variables
 + api-remote.txt: correct section "struct refspec"
 + t5510: check that "git fetch --prune --tags" does not prune branches
 + t5510: prepare test refs more straightforwardly
 + t5510: use the correct tag name in test

 The "-tags" option to "git fetch" used to be literally a synonym to
 a "refs/tags/*:refs/tags/*" refspec, which meant that (1) as an
 explicit refspec given from the command line, it silenced the lazy
 "git fetch" default that is configured, and (2) also as an explicit
 refspec given from the command line, it interacted with "--prune"
 to remove any tag that the remote we are fetching from does not
 have.

 This demotes it to an option; with it, we fetch all tags in
 addition to what would be fetched without the option, and it does
 not interact with the decision "--prune" makes to see what
 remote-tracking refs the local has are missing the remote
 counterpart.

* ak/submodule-foreach-quoting (2013-09-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-10-14 at d77c5f1)
 + submodule foreach: skip eval for more than one argument

 A behavior change, but a worthwhile one: "git submodule foreach"
 was treating its arguments as part of a single command to be
 concatenated and passed to a shell, making writing buggy
 scripts too easy.

 This patch preserves the old "just pass it to the shell" behavior
 when a single argument is passed to 'git submodule foreach' and
 moves to a new "skip the shell and use the arguments passed
 unmolested" behavior when more than one argument is passed.

 The old behavior (always concatenating and passing to the shell)
 was similar to the 'ssh' command, while the new behavior (switching
 on the number of arguments) is what 'xterm -e' does.

 May need more thought to make sure this change is advertised well
 so that scripts that used multiple arguments but added their own
 extra layer of quoting are not broken.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* kb/fast-hashmap (2013-10-22) 12 commits
 - remove old hash.[ch] implementation
 - read-cache.c: fix memory leaks caused by removed cache entries
 - name-hash.c: remove cache entries instead of marking them CE_UNHASHED
 - name-hash.c: use new hash map implementation for cache entries
 - name-hash.c: remove unreferenced directory entries
 - name-hash.c: use new hash map implementation for directories
 - diffcore-rename.c: use new hash map implementation
 - diffcore-rename.c: simplify finding exact renames
 - diffcore-rename.c: move code around to prepare for the next patch
 - buitin/describe.c: use new hash map implementation
 - add a hashtable implementation that supports O(1) removal
 - submodule: don't access the .gitmodules cache entry after removing it

 Improvements to our hash table to get it to meet the needs of the
 msysgit fscache project, with some nice performance improvements.

 The preparatory clean-up to submodule from Jens is at the bottom. I
 also squashed in a fix-up by Karsten found at $gmane/236468 (please
 double-check the result).

 More valgrind breakage reported ($gmane/236869).
