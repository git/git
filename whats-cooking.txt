What's cooking in git.git (May 2010, #04; Wed, 12)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones
marked with '.' do not appear in any of the integration branches, but I am
still holding onto them.

I'll be packing my primary machine tomorrow morning, and hopefully I can
resume my git activity early next week.  This will be the last pushout
until then.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* bw/diff-metainfo-color (2010-05-04) 1 commit
 - [sign-off?] diff: fix coloring of extended diff headers

* ph/clone-message-reword (2010-05-09) 1 commit
 - clone: reword messages to match the end-user perception

* rc/ls-remote-default (2010-05-12) 1 commit
 - ls-remote: print URL when no repo is specified

* fg/autocrlf (2010-05-12) 1 commit
 - autocrlf: Make it work also for un-normalized repositories

* tc/merge-m-log (2010-05-11) 8 commits
 - merge: --log appends shortlog to message if specified
 - fmt-merge-msg: add function to append shortlog only
 - fmt-merge-msg: refactor merge title formatting
 - fmt-merge-msg: minor refactor of fmt_merge_msg()
 - merge: rename variable
 - merge: update comment
 - t7604-merge-custom-message: show that --log doesn't append to -m
 - t7604-merge-custom-message: shift expected output creation

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* jc/rev-list-ancestry-path (2010-04-20) 1 commit
 - revision: --ancestry-path

Just an illustration patch.  merge simplification logic used when
pathspecs are in effect interacts with this rather badly.

* js/rebase-origin-x (2010-02-05) 1 commit
 - [RFC w/o test and incomplete] rebase: add -x option to record original commit name

I retract my objection against the idea of -x; needs polishing before
moving forward.

* js/grep-open (2010-05-01) 3 commits
 - grep: do not ignore return value from chdir()
 - grep -O: allow optional argument specifying the pager (or editor)
 - grep: Add the option '--open-files-in-pager'
 (this branch is used by jp/hold-string-list-sanity.)

Probably needs to support --no-index mode as well.

* jp/hold-string-list-sanity (2010-04-06) 9 commits
 . string_list: Fix argument order for string_list_append
 . Merge branch 'sr/remote-helper-export' into HEAD
 . Merge branch 'js/grep-open' into HEAD
 . Merge branch 'sb/fmt-merge-msg' into HEAD
 . string_list: Fix argument order for string_list_lookup
 . string_list: Fix argument order for string_list_insert_at_index
 . string_list: Fix argument order for string_list_insert
 . string_list: Fix argument order for for_each_string_list
 . string_list: Fix argument order for print_string_list
 (this branch uses js/grep-open and sr/remote-helper-export.)

Building this on top of slushy codebase is not a very promising endeavor.
Good thing to do, but it came at a bad time.
