What's cooking in git.git (May 2015, #05; Tue, 19)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.

The "untracked cache" series is in 'next', to give it a wider
exposure.  I do not use it personally, but it is meant to make life
easier for those with large amount of untracked cruft in their
working trees.  Please try it out and report successes (and of
course breakages, too).

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

[Graduated to "master"]

* bc/connect-plink (2015-04-28) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-05-05 at 9def2e1)
 + connect: improve check for plink to reduce false positives
 + t5601: fix quotation error leading to skipped tests
 + connect: simplify SSH connection code path

 The connection initiation code for "ssh" transport tried to absorb
 differences between the stock "ssh" and Putty-supplied "plink" and
 its derivatives, but the logic to tell that we are using "plink"
 variants were too loose and falsely triggered when "plink" appeared
 anywhere in the path (e.g. "/home/me/bin/uplink/ssh").


* fg/document-commit-message-stripping (2015-04-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-05-05 at 1892a99)
 + Documentation: clarify how "git commit" cleans up the edited log message


* jc/gitignore-precedence (2015-04-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-05-05 at 6ef85da)
 + ignore: info/exclude should trump core.excludesfile

 core.excludesfile (defaulting to $XDG_HOME/git/ignore) is supposed
 to be overridden by repository-specific .git/info/exclude file, but
 the order was swapped from the beginning. This belatedly fixes it.


* jc/merge (2015-04-29) 15 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-05-07 at 1c56512)
 + merge: deprecate 'git merge <message> HEAD <commit>' syntax
 + merge: handle FETCH_HEAD internally
 + merge: decide if we auto-generate the message early in collect_parents()
 + merge: make collect_parents() auto-generate the merge message
 + merge: extract prepare_merge_message() logic out
 + merge: narrow scope of merge_names
 + merge: split reduce_parents() out of collect_parents()
 + merge: clarify collect_parents() logic
 + merge: small leakfix and code simplification
 + merge: do not check argc to determine number of remote heads
 + merge: clarify "pulling into void" special case
 + t5520: test pulling an octopus into an unborn branch
 + t5520: style fixes
 + merge: simplify code flow
 + merge: test the top-level merge driver
 (this branch is used by jc/merge-drop-old-syntax and pt/pull-tests.)

 "git merge FETCH_HEAD" learned that the previous "git fetch" could
 be to create an Octopus merge, i.e. recording multiple branches
 that are not marked as "not-for-merge"; this allows us to lose an
 old style invocation "git merge <msg> HEAD $commits..." in the
 implementation of "git pull" script; the old style syntax can now
 be deprecated.


* jc/test-prereq-validate (2015-04-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-05-05 at a30464c)
 + test: validate prerequistes syntax

 Help us to find broken test script that splits the body part of the
 test by mistaken use of wrong kind of quotes.


* jk/git-no-more-argv0-path-munging (2015-04-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-05-05 at b3f9a45)
 + stop putting argv[0] dirname at front of PATH

 We have prepended $GIT_EXEC_PATH and the path "git" is installed in
 (typically "/usr/bin") to $PATH when invoking subprograms and hooks
 for almost eternity, but the original use case the latter tried to
 support was semi-bogus (i.e. install git to /opt/foo/git and run it
 without having /opt/foo on $PATH), and more importantly it has
 become less and less relevant as Git grew more mainstream (i.e. the
 users would _want_ to have it on their $PATH).  Stop prepending the
 path in which "git" is installed to users' $PATH, as that would
 interfere the command search order people depend on (e.g. they may
 not like versions of programs that are unrelated to Git in /usr/bin
 and want to override them by having different ones in /usr/local/bin
 and have the latter directory earlier in their $PATH).


* jk/stash-require-clean-index (2015-04-22) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-05-05 at b5f6c32)
 + stash: require a clean index to apply
 + t3903: avoid applying onto dirty index
 + t3903: stop hard-coding commit sha1s

 "git stash pop/apply" forgot to make sure that not just the working
 tree is clean but also the index is clean. The latter is important
 as a stash application can conflict and the index will be used for
 conflict resolution.


* jk/test-chain-lint (2015-04-28) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-05-05 at e6f0290)
 + test-lib: turn on GIT_TEST_CHAIN_LINT by default
 + t7502-commit.sh: fix a broken and-chain

 Developer support to automatically detect broken &&-chain in the
 test scripts is now turned on by default.


* kn/cat-file-literally (2015-05-06) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-05-12 at 04b29b5)
 + t1006: add tests for git cat-file --allow-unknown-type
 + cat-file: teach cat-file a '--allow-unknown-type' option
 + cat-file: make the options mutually exclusive
 + sha1_file: support reading from a loose object of unknown type

 Add the "--allow-unknown-type" option to "cat-file" to allow
 inspecting loose objects of an experimental or a broken type.


* nd/diff-i-t-a (2015-03-23) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-05-05 at cba9cd9)
 + diff-lib.c: adjust position of i-t-a entries in diff

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2015-03-24

 After "git add -N", the path appeared in output of "git diff HEAD"
 and "git diff --cached HEAD", leading "git status" to classify it
 as "Changes to be committed".  Such a path, however, is not yet to
 be scheduled to be committed.  "git diff" showed the change to the
 path as modification, not as a "new file", in the header of its
 output.

 Treat such paths as "yet to be added to the index but Git already
 know about them"; "git diff HEAD" and "git diff --cached HEAD"
 should not talk about them, and "git diff" should show them as new
 files yet to be added to the index.


* nd/dwim-wildcards-as-pathspecs (2015-05-03) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-05-07 at 8176de7)
 + pathspec: avoid the need of "--" when wildcard is used

 A heuristic to help the "git <cmd> <revs> <pathspec>" command line
 convention to catch mistyped paths is to make sure all the non-rev
 parameters in the later part of the command line are names of the
 files in the working tree, but that means "git grep $str -- \*.c"
 must always be disambiguated with "--", because nobody sane will
 create a file whose name literally is asterisk-dot-see.  Loosen the
 heuristic to declare that with a wildcard string the user likely
 meant to give us a pathspec.


* ph/rebase-i-redo (2015-04-29) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-05-07 at 8fc1f52)
 + rebase -i: redo tasks that die during cherry-pick

 "git rebase -i" moved the "current" command from "todo" to "done" a
 bit too prematurely, losing a step when a "pick" did not even start.


* sb/ref-lock-lose-lock-fd (2015-05-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-05-12 at dde9be1)
 + refs.c: remove lock_fd from struct ref_lock

 The refs API uses ref_lock struct which had its own "int fd", even
 though the same file descriptor was in the lock struct it contains.
 Clean-up the code to lose this redundant field.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* ja/tutorial-asciidoctor-fix (2015-05-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-05-19 at f15d940)
 + doc: fix unmatched code fences

 A literal block in the tutorial had lines with unequal lengths to
 delimit it from the rest of the document, which choke GitHub's
 AsciiDoc renderer.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/stripspace-asciidoctor-fix (2015-05-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-05-19 at 12f9059)
 + doc: fix unmatched code fences in git-stripspace

 A literal block in the tutorial had lines with unequal lengths to
 delimit it from the rest of the document, which choke GitHub's
 AsciiDoc renderer.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* dt/cat-file-follow-symlinks (2015-05-14) 3 commits
 - cat-file: add --follow-symlinks to --batch
 - sha1_name: get_sha1_with_context learns to follow symlinks
 - tree-walk: learn get_tree_entry_follow_symlinks

 "git cat-file --batch(-check)" learned the "--follow-symlinks"
 option that follows an in-tree symblic links when asked about an
 object via extended SHA-1 syntax, e.g. HEAD:RelNotes that points at
 Documentation/RelNotes/2.5.0.txt.  With the new option, the command
 behaves as if HEAD:Documentation/RelNotes/2.5.0.txt was given as
 input instead.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/add-e-kill-editor (2015-05-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-05-19 at 9e01174)
 + add: check return value of launch_editor

 "git add -e" did not allow the user to abort the operation by
 killing the editor.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/asciidoc-markup-fix (2015-05-14) 9 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-05-19 at df0c63e)
 + doc: convert AsciiDoc {?foo} to ifdef::foo[]
 + doc: put example URLs and emails inside literal backticks
 + doc: drop backslash quoting of some curly braces
 + doc: convert \--option to --option
 + doc/add: reformat `--edit` option
 + doc: fix length of underlined section-title
 + doc: fix hanging "+"-continuation
 + doc: fix unquoted use of "{type}"
 + doc: fix misrendering due to `single quote'

 Various documentation mark-up fixes to make the output more
 consistent in general and also make AsciiDoctor (an alternative
 formatter) happier.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* mh/ref-directory-file (2015-05-11) 18 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-05-19 at 38eb122)
 + reflog_expire(): integrate lock_ref_sha1_basic() errors into ours
 + ref_transaction_commit(): delete extra "the" from error message
 + ref_transaction_commit(): provide better error messages
 + rename_ref(): integrate lock_ref_sha1_basic() errors into ours
 + lock_ref_sha1_basic(): improve diagnostics for ref D/F conflicts
 + lock_ref_sha1_basic(): report errors via a "struct strbuf *err"
 + verify_refname_available(): report errors via a "struct strbuf *err"
 + verify_refname_available(): rename function
 + refs: check for D/F conflicts among refs created in a transaction
 + ref_transaction_commit(): use a string_list for detecting duplicates
 + is_refname_available(): use dirname in first loop
 + struct nonmatching_ref_data: store a refname instead of a ref_entry
 + report_refname_conflict(): inline function
 + entry_matches(): inline function
 + is_refname_available(): convert local variable "dirname" to strbuf
 + is_refname_available(): avoid shadowing "dir" variable
 + is_refname_available(): revamp the comments
 + t1404: new tests of ref D/F conflicts within transactions

 The ref API did not handle cases where 'refs/heads/xyzzy/frotz' is
 removed at the same time as 'refs/heads/xyzzy' is added (or vice
 versa) very well.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* dt/clean-pathspec-filter-then-lstat (2015-05-18) 1 commit
 - clean: only lstat files in pathspec

 "git clean pathspec..." tried to lstat(2) and complain even for
 paths outside the given pathspec.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jh/filter-empty-contents (2015-05-18) 1 commit
 - sha1_file: pass empty buffer to index empty file

 The clean/smudge interface did not work well when filtering an
 empty contents (failed and then passed the empty input through).
 It can be argued that a filter that produces anything but empty for
 an empty input is nonsense, but if the user wants to do strange
 things, then why not?

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/http-backend-deadlock (2015-05-15) 2 commits
 - http-backend: spool ref negotiation requests to buffer
 - http-backend: fix die recursion with custom handler

 Communication between the HTTP server and http_backend process can
 lead to a dead-lock when relaying a large ref negotiation request.
 Diagnose the situation better, and mitigate it by reading such a
 request first into core (to a reasonable limit).

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/rerere-forget-check-enabled (2015-05-14) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-05-19 at bfe67dc)
 + rerere: exit silently on "forget" when rerere is disabled

 "git rerere forget" in a repository without rerere enabled gave a
 cryptic error message; it should be a silent no-op instead.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* lm/squelch-bg-progress (2015-05-19) 1 commit
 - progress: treat "no terminal" as being in the foreground

 The controlling tty-based heuristics to squelch progress output did
 not consider that the process may not be talking to a tty at all
 (e.g. sending the progress to sideband #2).  This is a finishing
 touch to a topic that is already in 'master'.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* mg/log-decorate-HEAD (2015-05-13) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-05-19 at 009342b)
 + log: do not shorten decoration names too early
 + log: decorate HEAD with branch name under --decorate=full, too

 The "log --decorate" enhancement in Git 2.4 that shows the commit
 at the tip of the current branch e.g. "HEAD -> master", did not
 work with --decorate=full.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* mh/clone-verbosity-fix (2015-05-19) 1 commit
 - clone: call transport_set_verbosity before anything else on the newly created transport

 Git 2.4 broke setting verbosity and progress levels on "git clone"
 with native transports.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* mh/lockfile-retry (2015-05-14) 2 commits
 - lock_packed_refs(): allow retries when acquiring the packed-refs lock
 - lockfile: allow file locking to be retried with a timeout

 Instead of dying immediately upon failing to obtain a lock, retry
 after a short while with backoff.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* mm/log-format-raw-doc (2015-05-18) 3 commits
 - SQUASH
 - Documentation/log: clarify sha1 non-abbreviation in log --raw
 - Documentation/log: clarify what --raw means

 Clarify that "log --raw" and "log --format=raw" are unrelated
 concepts.

 Will merge to 'next' after squashing the fixup.


* ps/doc-packfile-vs-pack-file (2015-05-17) 3 commits
 - pack-protocol.txt: fix insconsistent spelling of "packfile"
 - git-unpack-objects.txt: fix inconsistent spelling of "packfile"
 - git-verify-pack.txt: fix inconsistent spelling of "packfile"

 Doc consistency updates.  I am not sure if this is unifying in the
 right direction, though.


* pt/pull-ff-vs-merge-ff (2015-05-18) 2 commits
 - pull: parse pull.ff as a bool or string
 - pull: make pull.ff=true override merge.ff

 The pull.ff configuration was supposed to override the merge.ff
 configuration, but it didn't.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* pt/pull-log-n (2015-05-18) 1 commit
 - pull: handle --log=<n>

 "git pull --log" and "git pull --no-log" worked as expected, but
 "git pull --log=20" did not.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* pt/pull-tags-error-diag (2015-05-14) 1 commit
 - pull: remove --tags error in no merge candidates case

 There was a dead code that used to handle "git pull --tags" and
 show special-cased error message, which was made irrelevant when
 the semantics of the option changed back in Git 1.9 days.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* rs/plug-leak-in-pack-bitmaps (2015-05-19) 1 commit
 - pack-bitmaps: plug memory leak, fix allocation size for recent_bitmaps

 The code to memoise recently used pack bitmaps were totally broken.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sb/t1020-cleanup (2015-05-18) 1 commit
 - subdirectory tests: code cleanup, uncomment test

 There was a commented-out (instead of being marked to expect
 failure) test that documented a breakage that was fixed since the
 test was written; turn it into a proper test.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sg/completion-config (2015-05-12) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-05-19 at c83fde1)
 + completion: simplify query for config variables
 + completion: add a helper function to get config variables

 Code clean-up for completion script (in contrib/).

 Will merge to 'master'.


* sg/help-group (2015-05-18) 5 commits
 - help: respect new common command grouping
 - command-list.txt: drop the "common" tag
 - generate-cmdlist: parse common group commands
 - command-list.txt: add the common groups block
 - command-list: prepare machinery for upcoming "common groups" section
 (this branch uses sg/help-subcommands.)

 Group list of commands shown by "git help" along the workflow
 elements to help early learners.


* jc/ignore-epipe-in-filter (2015-05-19) 2 commits
 - filter_buffer_or_fd(): ignore EPIPE
 - copy.c: make copy_fd() report its status silently

 Filter scripts were run with SIGPIPE disabled on the Git side,
 expecting that they may not read what Git feeds them to filter.
 We however treated a filter that does not read its input fully
 before exiting as an error.

 This changes semantics, but arguably in a good way.  If a filter
 can produce its output without consuming its input using whatever
 magic, we now let it do so, instead of diagnosing it as a
 programming error.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* kk/log-merges-config (2015-04-21) 5 commits
 - bash-completion: add support for git-log --merges= and log.merges
 - t4202-log: add tests for --merges=
 - Documentation: add git-log --merges= option and log.merges config. var
 - log: honor log.merges= option
 - revision: add --merges={show|only|hide} option

 "git log" (but not other commands in the "log" family) learned to
 pay attention to the log.merges configuration variable that can be
 set to "show" (the normal behaviour), "only" (hide non-merge
 commits), or "hide" (hide merge commits).  --merges=(show|only|hide)
 can be used to override the setting from the command line.

 The documentation may need to be updated once more ($gmane/267250).
 Waiting for a reroll.


* mg/httpd-tests-update-for-apache-2.4 (2015-04-08) 2 commits
 - t/lib-git-svn: check same httpd module dirs as lib-httpd
 - t/lib-httpd: load mod_unixd

 This is the first two commits in a three-patch series $gmane/266962
 Will be rerolled.
 with updated log message ($gmane/268061).


* mh/numparse (2015-03-19) 14 commits
 - diff_opt_parse(): use convert_i() when handling --abbrev=<num>
 - diff_opt_parse(): use convert_i() when handling "-l<num>"
 - opt_arg(): simplify pointer handling
 - opt_arg(): report errors parsing option values
 - opt_arg(): use convert_i() in implementation
 - opt_arg(): val is always non-NULL
 - builtin_diff(): detect errors when parsing --unified argument
 - handle_revision_opt(): use convert_ui() when handling "--abbrev="
 - strtoul_ui(), strtol_i(): remove functions
 - handle_revision_opt(): use convert_i() when handling "-<digit>"
 - handle_revision_opt(): use skip_prefix() in many places
 - write_subdirectory(): use convert_ui() for parsing mode
 - cacheinfo_callback(): use convert_ui() when handling "--cacheinfo"
 - numparse: new module for parsing integral numbers

 Many codepaths use unchecked use of strtol() and friends (or even
 worse, atoi()).  Introduce a set of wrappers that try to be more
 careful.

 Will be rerolled.
 ($gmane/268058).


* tf/gitweb-project-listing (2015-03-19) 5 commits
 - gitweb: make category headings into links when they are directories
 - gitweb: optionally set project category from its pathname
 - gitweb: add a link under the search box to clear a project filter
 - gitweb: if the PATH_INFO is incomplete, use it as a project_filter
 - gitweb: fix typo in man page

 Update gitweb to make it more pleasant to deal with a hierarchical
 forest of repositories.

 Any comments from those who use or have their own code in Gitweb?


* jc/a-lone-dash-stands-for-previous-branch (2015-03-16) 1 commit
 - "-" and "@{-1}" on various programs

 Lose special case code to make a lone dash "-" mean the previous
 branch aka "@{-1}" from a handful subcommands, and instead support
 the notation throughout the system by reimplementing it at the
 revisions layer.

 Needs tests, documentation updates, etc.  Also does only a half-way
 job dealing with range notation, which needs to be fixed before the
 series goes anywhere.


* nd/list-files (2015-02-09) 21 commits
 - t3080: tests for git-list-files
 - list-files: -M aka diff-cached
 - list-files -F: show submodules with the new indicator '&'
 - list-files: add -F/--classify
 - list-files: show directories as well as files

 - list-files: sort output and remove duplicates
 - list-files: add -t back
 - list-files: add -1 short for --no-column
 - list-files: add -R/--recursive short for --max-depth=-1
 - list-files: -u does not imply showing stages

 - ls_colors.c: highlight submodules like directories
 - ls_colors.c: add a function to color a file name
 - ls_colors.c: parse color.ls.* from config file
 - ls_colors.c: add $LS_COLORS parsing code

 A new "git list-files" Porcelain command, "ls-files" with bells and
 whistles.

 Reroll to base on wt-status work ($gmane/265142) has seen some
 positive discussions.

 Waiting for a further polished reroll ($gmane/265534).

 - fsck: offer a function to demote fsck errors to warnings
 - fsck: provide a function to parse fsck message IDs
 - fsck: introduce identifiers for fsck messages
 - fsck: introduce fsck options

 "fsck.warnings = <list of error tokens>" I suggested turned out to
 be an unpopular choice (sorry Dscho).

 Expecting a reroll.


* nd/pathspec-strip-fix (2015-04-18) 1 commit
 - pathspec: adjust prefixlen after striping trailing slash

 Does not quite fix ($gmane/267614).
 Will discard.


* jc/diff-b-m (2015-02-23) 5 commits
 . WIPWIP
 . WIP: diff-b-m
 - diffcore-rename: allow easier debugging
 - diffcore-rename.c: add locate_rename_src()
 - diffcore-break: allow debugging

 "git diff -B -M" produced incorrect patch when the postimage of a
 completely rewritten file is similar to the preimage of a removed
 file; such a resulting file must not be expressed as a rename from
 other place.

 The fix in this patch is broken, unfortunately.


* pw/remote-set-url-fetch (2014-11-26) 1 commit
 - remote: add --fetch and --both options to set-url

 Expecting a reroll.


* tr/remerge-diff (2014-11-10) 9 commits

 - name-hash: allow dir hashing even when !ignore_case
 - merge-recursive: allow storing conflict hunks in index
 - merge_diff_mode: fold all merge diff variants into an enum
 - combine-diff: do not pass revs->dense_combined_merges redundantly
 - merge-recursive: -Xindex-only to leave worktree unchanged
 - merge-recursive: internal flag to avoid touching the worktree
 - merge-recursive: remove dead conditional in update_stages()

 "log -p" output learns a new way to let users inspect a merge
 commit by showing the differences between the automerged result
 with conflicts the person who recorded the merge would have seen
 and the final conflict resolution that was recorded in the merge.

 Waiting for a reroll ($gmane/256591).


* hv/submodule-config (2014-11-11) 4 commits
 - do not die on error of parsing fetchrecursesubmodules option
 - use new config API for worktree configurations of submodules
 - extract functions for submodule config set and lookup
 - implement submodule config cache for lookup of submodule names

 Kicked back to 'pu' per request ($gmane/255610).


* tg/perf-lib-test-perf-cleanup (2013-09-19) 2 commits
 - perf-lib: add test_perf_cleanup target
 - perf-lib: split starting the test from the execution

 Add test_perf_cleanup shell function to the perf suite, that allows
 the script writers to define a test with a clean-up action.

 Will hold.


* jc/show-branch (2014-03-24) 5 commits
 - show-branch: use commit slab to represent bitflags of arbitrary width
 - show-branch.c: remove "all_mask"
 - show-branch.c: abstract out "flags" operation

 - show-branch.c: update comment style

 Waiting for the final step to lift the hard-limit.

* dl/branch-error-message (2015-05-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-05-11 at ed947ab)
 + branch: do not call a "remote-tracking branch" a "remote branch"

 Error messages from "git branch" called remote-tracking branches as
 "remote branches".

 Will merge to 'master' in the fourth batch.


* dl/subtree-push-no-squash (2015-05-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-05-11 at 74d07ca)
 + contrib/subtree: there's no push --squash

 "git subtree" script (in contrib/) does not have --squash option
 when pushing, but the documentation and help text pretended as if
 it did.

 Will merge to 'master' in the fourth batch.


* ld/p4-editor-multi-words (2015-05-19) 3 commits
 - git-p4: fix handling of multi-word P4EDITOR
 - SQUASH???
 - git-p4: add failing test for P4EDITOR handling

 Unlike "$EDITOR" and "$GIT_EDITOR" that can hold the path to the
 command and initial options (e.g. "/path/to/emacs -nw"), 'git p4'
 did not let the shell interpolate the contents of the environment
 variable that name the editor "$P4EDITOR" (and "$EDITOR", too).
 Make it in line with the rest of Git, as well as with Perforce.


* dl/subtree-avoid-tricky-echo (2015-05-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-05-11 at 36d4f0e)
 + contrib/subtree: portability fix for string printing

 "git subtree" script (in contrib/) used "echo -n" to produce
 progress messages in a non-portable way.

 Will merge to 'master' in the fourth batch.


* ls/http-ssl-cipher-list (2015-05-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-05-11 at 55764ce)
 + http: add support for specifying an SSL cipher list

 Introduce http.<url>.SSLCipherList configuration variable to tweak
 the list of cipher suite to be used with libcURL when talking with
 https:// sites.

 Will merge to 'master' in the fourth batch.


* ps/bundle-verify-arg (2015-05-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-05-11 at 9f1b1ae)
 + bundle: verify arguments more strictly

 "git bundle verify" did not diagnose extra parameters on the
 command line.

 Will merge to 'master' in the fourth batch.


* sg/help-subcommands (2015-05-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-05-11 at 91e4f9e)
 + command-list.txt: fix whitespace inconsistency
 (this branch is used by sg/help-group.)

 A preparatory clean-up step.

 Will merge to 'master' in the fourth batch.


* mh/write-refs-sooner-2.2 (2015-05-12) 8 commits
 + ref_transaction_commit(): fix atomicity and avoid fd exhaustion
 + ref_transaction_commit(): remove the local flags variable
 + ref_transaction_commit(): inline call to write_ref_sha1()
 + rename_ref(): inline calls to write_ref_sha1() from this function
 + commit_ref_update(): new function, extracted from write_ref_sha1()
 + write_ref_to_lockfile(): new function, extracted from write_ref_sha1()
 + t7004: rename ULIMIT test prerequisite to ULIMIT_STACK_SIZE
 + update-ref: test handling large transactions properly
 (this branch is used by mh/write-refs-sooner-2.3 and mh/write-refs-sooner-2.4.)

 Multi-ref transaction support we merged a few releases ago
 unnecessarily kept many file descriptors open, risking to fail with
 resource exhaustion.


* mh/write-refs-sooner-2.3 (2015-05-12) 1 commit
 + Merge branch 'mh/write-refs-sooner-2.2' into mh/write-refs-sooner-2.3
 (this branch is used by mh/write-refs-sooner-2.4; uses mh/write-refs-sooner-2.2.)

 Multi-ref transaction support we merged a few releases ago
 unnecessarily kept many file descriptors open, risking to fail with
 resource exhaustion.  This is for 2.3.x track.


* mh/write-refs-sooner-2.4 (2015-05-12) 9 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-05-19 at f7be074)

 (this branch uses mh/write-refs-sooner-2.2 and mh/write-refs-sooner-2.3.)

 Multi-ref transaction support we merged a few releases ago
 unnecessarily kept many file descriptors open, risking to fail with
 resource exhaustion.  This is for 2.4.x track.


* sg/completion-omit-credential-helpers (2015-05-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-05-11 at aa7e554)
 + completion: remove credential helpers from porcelain commands

 The Git subcommand completion (in contrib/) listed credential
 helpers among candidates, which is not something the end user would
 invoke interatively.

 Will merge to 'master' in the fourth batch.


* jk/skip-http-tests-under-no-curl (2015-05-07) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-05-11 at a52b711)
 + tests: skip dav http-push tests under NO_EXPAT=NoThanks
 + t/lib-httpd.sh: skip tests if NO_CURL is defined

 Test clean-up.

 Will merge to 'master' in the fourth batch.


* pt/pull-tests (2015-05-18) 8 commits
 - t5520: check reflog action in fast-forward merge
 - t5521: test --dry-run does not make any changes
 - t5520: test --rebase failure on unborn branch with index
 - t5520: test --rebase with multiple branches
 - t5520: test work tree fast-forward when fetch updates head
 - t5520: test for failure if index has unresolved entries
 - t5520: test no merge candidates cases
 - t5520: prevent field splitting in content comparisons

 Add more test coverage to "git pull".


* jc/clone-bundle (2015-04-30) 1 commit
 - repack: optionally create a clone.bundle

 Still an early WIP


* jk/at-push-sha1 (2015-05-03) 12 commits
 - for-each-ref: accept "%(push)" format
 - for-each-ref: use skip_prefix instead of starts_with
 - sha1_name: implement @{push} shorthand
 - sha1_name: refactor interpret_upstream_mark
 - sha1_name: refactor upstream_mark
 - remote.c: add branch_get_push
 - remote.c: report specific errors from branch_get_upstream
 - remote.c: introduce branch_get_upstream helper
 - remote.c: provide per-branch pushremote name
 - remote.c: hoist branch.*.remote lookup out of remote_get_1
 - remote.c: drop "remote" pointer from "struct branch"
 - remote.c: drop default_remote_name variable

 Introduce <branch>@{push} short-hand to denote the remote-tracking
 branch that tracks the branch at the remote the <branch> would be
 pushed to.

 Expecting a reroll ($gmane/268419, etc.).


* ee/clean-remove-dirs (2015-04-26) 5 commits
 - clean: improve performance when removing lots of directories
 - p7300: add performance tests for clean
 - t7300: add tests to document behavior of clean and nested git
 - setup: sanity check file size in read_gitfile_gently
 - setup: add gentle version of read_gitfile

 Replace "is this subdirectory a separate repository that should not
 be touched?" check "git clean" does by checking if it has .git/HEAD
 using the submodule-related code with a more optimized check.

 Waiting for a reroll.


* jc/merge-drop-old-syntax (2015-04-29) 1 commit
 - merge: drop 'git merge <message> HEAD <commit>' syntax

 Stop supporting "git merge <messsage> HEAD <commit>" syntax that
 has been deprecated since October 2007.

 Will merge to 'next' and keep there during the 2.5 cycle.


* ah/usage-strings (2015-05-03) 2 commits
 - branch: fix funny-sounding error message
 - blame, log: format usage strings similarly to those in documentation

 A few usage string updates.  The tip one still needs work.
