What's cooking in git.git (Nov 2018, #04; Tue, 13)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* ab/pack-tests-cleanup (2018-10-31) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-03 at b4a39595bb)
 + index-pack tests: don't leave test repo dirty at end
 + pack-objects tests: don't leave test .git corrupt at end
 + pack-objects test: modernize style

 A couple of tests used to leave the repository in a state that is
 deliberately corrupt, which have been corrected.


* ag/rebase-i-in-c (2018-11-05) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-06 at 8fa9d64898)
 + sequencer.c: remove a stray semicolon

 Code clean-up for a topic already in 'master'.


* ag/rev-parse-all-exclude-fix (2018-11-01) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-03 at 49730558fa)
 + rev-parse: clear --exclude list after 'git rev-parse --all'

 "git rev-parse --exclude=* --branches --branches"  (i.e. first
 saying "add only things that do not match '*' out of all branches"
 and then adding all branches, without any exclusion this time")
 worked as expected, but "--exclude=* --all --all" did not work the
 same way, which has been fixed.


* al/send-email-auto-cte-fixup (2018-11-02) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-05 at 4ecb1133ce)
 + send-email: avoid empty transfer encoding header

 "git send-email --transfer-encoding=..." in recent versions of Git
 sometimes produced an empty "Content-Transfer-Encoding:" header,
 which has been corrected.


* ao/submodule-wo-gitmodules-checked-out (2018-10-31) 10 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-03 at 00c3377ef0)
 + t/helper: add test-submodule-nested-repo-config
 + submodule: support reading .gitmodules when it's not in the working tree
 + submodule: add a helper to check if it is safe to write to .gitmodules
 + t7506: clean up .gitmodules properly before setting up new scenario
 + submodule: use the 'submodule--helper config' command
 + submodule--helper: add a new 'config' subcommand
 + t7411: be nicer to future tests and really clean things up
 + t7411: merge tests 5 and 6
 + submodule: factor out a config_set_in_gitmodules_file_gently function
 + submodule: add a print_config_from_gitmodules() helper
 (this branch is used by sb/submodule-recursive-fetch-gets-the-tip.)

 The submodule support has been updated to read from the blob at
 HEAD:.gitmodules when the .gitmodules file is missing from the
 working tree.


* bp/add-diff-files-optim (2018-11-03) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-06 at cdaeb7924a)
 + add: speed up cmd_add() by utilizing read_cache_preload()

 "git add" needs to internally run "diff-files" equivalent, and the
 codepath learned the same optimization as "diff-files" has to run
 lstat(2) in parallel to find which paths have been updated in the
 working tree.


* bp/refresh-index-using-preload (2018-11-06) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-06 at d9b9d8f559)
 + refresh_index: remove unnecessary calls to preload_index()
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-01 at 289e6bcece)
 + speed up refresh_index() by utilizing preload_index()

 The helper function to refresh the cached stat information in the
 in-core index has learned to perform the lstat() part of the
 operation in parallel on multi-core platforms.


* bp/reset-quiet (2018-10-24) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-29 at 71f4fbc802)
 + reset: warn when refresh_index() takes more than 2 seconds
 + reset: add new reset.quiet config setting
 + reset: don't compute unstaged changes after reset when --quiet
 (this branch is used by nd/config-split.)

 "git reset --quiet" no longer runs "update-index --refresh"
 internally, which shifts the refresh cost away from the command.


* ds/add-missing-tags (2018-11-03) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-05 at 8388baf76d)
 + remote: make add_missing_tags() linear
 + test-reach: test get_reachable_subset
 + commit-reach: implement get_reachable_subset

 The history traversal used to implement the tag-following has been
 optimized by introducing a new helper.


* ds/test-multi-pack-index (2018-10-26) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-03 at 624c415a45)
 + packfile: close multi-pack-index in close_all_packs
 + multi-pack-index: define GIT_TEST_MULTI_PACK_INDEX
 + midx: close multi-pack-index on repack
 + midx: fix broken free() in close_midx()

 Tests for the recently introduced multi-pack index machinery.


* jc/war-on-string-list (2018-11-01) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-03 at 2ff65073f1)
 + fetch: replace string-list used as a look-up table with a hashmap

 Replace three string-list instances used as look-up tables in "git
 fetch" with hashmaps.


* jk/detect-truncated-zlib-input (2018-10-31) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-03 at 4952b4412b)
 + Adjust for 2.19.x series
 + cat-file: handle streaming failures consistently
 + check_stream_sha1(): handle input underflow
 + t1450: check large blob in trailing-garbage test

 A regression in Git 2.12 era made "git fsck" fall into an infinite
 loop while processing truncated loose objects.


* jk/misc-unused-fixes (2018-11-07) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-07 at 8438c0b245)
 + approxidate: fix NULL dereference in date_time()
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-05 at 03429f23c4)
 + pathspec: handle non-terminated strings with :(attr)
 + approxidate: handle pending number for "specials"
 + rev-list: handle flags for --indexed-objects

 Assorted fixes for bugs found while auditing -Wunused-parameter
 warnings.


* jk/proto-v2-ref-prefix-fix (2018-10-31) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-03 at 3a203db692)
 + ls-remote: pass heads/tags prefixes to transport
 + ls-remote: do not send ref prefixes for patterns

 "git ls-remote $there foo" was broken by recent update for the
 protocol v2 and stopped showing refs that match 'foo' that are not
 refs/{heads,tags}/foo, which has been fixed.


* jk/stream-pack-non-delta-clarification (2018-10-31) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-03 at bd386692c8)
 + read_istream_pack_non_delta(): document input handling

 Additional comment on a tricky piece of code to help developers.


* jk/xdiff-interface (2018-11-05) 9 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-05 at 0edd69cdad)
 + xdiff-interface: drop parse_hunk_header()
 + range-diff: use a hunk callback
 + diff: convert --check to use a hunk callback
 + combine-diff: use an xdiff hunk callback
 + diff: use hunk callback for word-diff
 + diff: discard hunk headers for patch-ids earlier
 + diff: avoid generating unused hunk header lines
 + xdiff-interface: provide a separate consume callback for hunks
 + xdiff: provide a separate emit callback for hunks

 The interface into "xdiff" library used to discover the offset and
 size of a generated patch hunk by first formatting it into the
 textual hunk header "@@ -n,m +k,l @@" and then parsing the numbers
 out.  A new interface has been introduced to allow callers a more
 direct access to them.


* js/mingw-isatty-and-dup2 (2018-10-31) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-03 at 0616899d9e)
 + mingw: fix isatty() after dup2()

 Windows fix.


* js/mingw-perl5lib (2018-10-31) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-03 at 2fa516f3ae)
 + mingw: unset PERL5LIB by default
 + config: move Windows-specific config settings into compat/mingw.c
 + config: allow for platform-specific core.* config settings
 + config: rename `dummy` parameter to `cb` in git_default_config()

 Windows fix.


* js/mingw-utf8-env (2018-10-31) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-03 at f6c5a8b609)
 + mingw: reencode environment variables on the fly (UTF-16 <-> UTF-8)
 + t7800: fix quoting

 Windows fix.


* js/rebase-p-tests (2018-11-02) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-03 at fc8d97465f)
 + tests: optionally skip `git rebase -p` tests
 + t3418: decouple test cases from a previous `rebase -p` test case
 + t3404: decouple some test cases from outcomes of previous test cases

 In preparation to the day when we can deprecate and remove the
 "rebase -p", make sure we can skip and later remove tests for
 it.


* jt/tighten-fetch-proto-v2-response (2018-11-01) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-03 at 310fe3f2c3)
 + fetch-pack: be more precise in parsing v2 response

 "git fetch" was a bit loose in parsing resposes from the other side
 when talking over the protocol v2.


* ma/sequencer-do-reset-saner-loop-termination (2018-10-31) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-03 at 99da78997d)
 + sequencer: break out of loop explicitly

 Code readability fix.


* nb/worktree-api-doc (2018-10-31) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-03 at de9befb1f3)
 + worktree: rename is_worktree_locked to worktree_lock_reason
 + worktree: update documentation for lock_reason and lock_reason_valid

 Code readability fix.


* nd/complete-format-patch (2018-11-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-06 at 7f4c58c9d0)
 + completion: use __gitcomp_builtin for format-patch

 The support for format-patch (and send-email) by the command-line
 completion script (in contrib/) has been simplified a bit.


* nd/config-split (2018-10-29) 79 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-03 at a336559101)

 + Update makefile in preparation for Documentation/config/*.txt
 + Merge branches 'bp/reset-quiet' and 'js/mingw-http-ssl' into nd/config-split
 (this branch uses bp/reset-quiet.)

 Split the overly large Documentation/config.txt file into million
 little pieces.  This potentially allows each individual piece
 included into the manual page of the command it affects more easily.

 This is a painful conversions while many other topics in flight
 wants to add to or edit the documentation of configuration
 variables.


* nd/per-worktree-config (2018-10-22) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-01 at 3746343ca8)
 + worktree: add per-worktree config files
 + t1300: extract and use test_cmp_config()

 A fourth class of configuration files (in addition to the
 traditional "system wide", "per user in the $HOME directory" and
 "per repository in the $GIT_DIR/config") has been introduced so
 that different worktrees that share the same repository (hence the
 same $GIT_DIR/config file) can use different customization.


* nd/per-worktree-ref-iteration (2018-11-05) 9 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-06 at 53803cedf3)
 + git-worktree.txt: correct linkgit command name
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-03 at 4cbe49a704)
 + reflog expire: cover reflog from all worktrees
 + fsck: check HEAD and reflog from other worktrees
 + fsck: move fsck_head_link() to get_default_heads() to avoid some globals
 + revision.c: better error reporting on ref from different worktrees
 + revision.c: correct a parameter name
 + refs: new ref types to make per-worktree refs visible to all worktrees
 + Add a place for (not) sharing stuff between worktrees
 + refs.c: indent with tabs, not spaces

 The code to traverse objects for reachability, used to decide what
 objects are unreferenced and expendable, have been taught to also
 consider per-worktree refs of other worktrees as starting points to
 prevent data loss.


* nd/tree-walk-path-exclusion (2018-11-05) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-06 at 6499b2d327)
 + tree-walk.c: fix overoptimistic inclusion in :(exclude) matching

 Pathspec matching against a tree object were buggy when negative
 pathspec elements were involved, which has been fixed.


* nd/wildmatch-double-asterisk (2018-10-29) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-01 at 627186d020)
 + wildmatch: change behavior of "foo**bar" in WM_PATHNAME mode

 A pattern with '**' that does not have a slash on either side used
 to be an invalid one, but the code now treats such double-asterisks
 the same way as two normal asterisks that happen to be adjacent to
 each other.


* pw/am-rebase-read-author-script (2018-11-01) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-03 at bb6c32fe16)
 + sequencer: use read_author_script()
 + add read_author_script() to libgit
 + am: rename read_author_script()
 + am: improve author-script error reporting
 + am: don't die in read_author_script()

 Unify code to read the author-script used in "git am" and the
 commands that use the sequencer machinery, e.g. "git rebase -i".


* sg/travis-install-dependencies (2018-11-02) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-06 at b86e3a2792)
 + travis-ci: install packages in 'ci/install-dependencies.sh'

 The procedure to install dependencies before testing at Travis CI
 is getting revamped for both simplicity and flexibility, taking
 advantage of the recent move to the vm-based environment.


* sh/mingw-safer-compat-poll (2018-11-05) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-05 at 933a940a68)
 + poll: use GetTickCount64() to avoid wrap-around issues

 Windows fix.

 - builtin/notes: remove unnecessary free

 Code cleanup.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* dl/remote-save-to-push (2018-11-13) 1 commit
 - remote: add --save-to-push option to git remote set-url

 "git remote set-url" learned a new option that moves existing value
 of the URL field to pushURL field of the remote before replacing
 the URL field with a new value.

 Undecided.


* jk/loose-object-cache (2018-11-13) 9 commits
 - fetch-pack: drop custom loose object cache
 - sha1-file: use loose object cache for quick existence check
 - object-store: provide helpers for loose_objects_cache
 - sha1-file: use an object_directory for the main object dir

 (non-)existence of loose objects.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* js/apply-recount-allow-noop (2018-11-13) 1 commit
 - apply --recount: allow "no-op hunks"

 When editing a patch in a "git add -i" session, a hunk could be
 made to no-op.  The "git apply" program used to reject a patch with
 such a no-op hunk to catch user mistakes, but it is now updated to
 explicitly allow a no-op hunk in an edited patch.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* js/builtin-rebase-perf-fix (2018-11-13) 3 commits
 - built-in rebase: reinstate `checkout -q` behavior where appropriate

 Code clean-up with correction to make the reimplemented "git
 rebase" a more faithful rewrite of the original, which also regains
 performance.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 The transport layer has been updated so that the protocol version
 used can be negotiated between the parties, by the initiator
 listing the protocol versions it is willing to talk, and the other
 side choosing from one of them.

 - branch: mark and colorize a branch differently if it is checked out in a linked worktree
 - ref-filter: add worktree atom

 "git branch --list" learned to show branches that are checked out
 in other worktrees connected to the same repository prefixed with
 '+', similar to the way the currently checked out branch is shown

* tb/xcurl-off-t (2018-11-12) 1 commit
 - remote-curl.c: xcurl_off_t is not portable (on 32 bit platfoms)

 The xcurl_off_t() helper function is used to cast size_t to
 curl_off_t, but some compilers gave warnings against the code to
 ensure the casting is done without wraparound, when size_t is
 narrower than curl_off_t.  This warning has been squelched.

* lt/date-human (2018-07-09) 1 commit
 - Add 'human' date format

 A new date format "--date=human" that morphs its output depending
 on how far the time is from the current time has been introduced.
 "--date=auto" can be used to use this new format when the output is
 goint to the pager or to the terminal and otherwise the default
 format.

* ds/push-squelch-ambig-warning (2018-11-07) 1 commit
 - pack-objects: ignore ambiguous object warnings

 "git push" used to check ambiguities between object-names and

 which was unnecessary (as it knew that it is feeding raw object
 names).  This has been optimized out.

 - push: move unqualified refname error into a function
 - push: improve the error shown on unqualified <dst> push
 - i18n: remote.c: mark error(...) messages for translation
 - remote.c: add braces in anticipation of a follow-up change

 "git push $there $src:$dst" rejects when $dst is not a fully
 qualified refname and not clear what the end user meant.  The
 codepath has been taught to give a clearer error message, and also
 guess where the push should go by taking the type of the pushed
 object into account (e.g. a tag object would want to go under
 refs/tags/).

 The last few steps are questionable.

* md/list-lazy-objects-fix (2018-10-29) 1 commit
 - list-objects.c: don't segfault for missing cmdline objects

 "git rev-list --exclude-promissor-objects" had to take an object
 that does not exist locally (and is lazily available) from the
 command line without barfing, but the code dereferenced NULL.

 That sympotom may be worth addressing, but I think the "fix" is
 overly broad and is wrong.  Giving a missing object should be
 diagnosed as an error, not swept under the rug silently.

 Ejected out of 'pu', as doing so seems to help other topics get

 gave us https://travis-ci.org/git/git/builds/452778963 which still

 . sequencer: make the todo_list structure public
 . sequencer: changes in parse_insn_buffer()

 The scripted version of "git rebase -i" wrote and rewrote the todo
 list many times during a single step of its operation, and the
 recent C-rewrite made a faithful conversion of the logic to C.  The
 implementation has been updated to carry necessary information
 around in-core to avoid rewriting the same file over and over
 unnecessarily.

 With too many topics in-flight that touch sequencer and rebaser,
 this need to wait giving precedence to other topics that fix bugs.
