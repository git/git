What's cooking in git.git (Mar 2020, #06; Thu, 19)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

Git 2.26-rc2 has been tagged.  Many fixes accumulated on the
'master' front have been flushed to 'maint' and has been tagged
as Git 2.25.2.  'git-gui' has been updated from the maintainer tree
in preparation for the upcoming release.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

 added with the intent-to-add bit.

 Expecting a reroll.

 - zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

* at/rebase-fork-point-regression-fix (2020-02-11) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-03-02 at a1a84d37a7)
 + rebase: --fork-point regression fix

 The "--fork-point" mode of "git rebase" regressed when the command
 was rewritten in C back in 2.20 era, which has been corrected.

* jc/describe-misnamed-annotated-tag (2020-02-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-03-02 at b4e2ca6a46)
 + describe: force long format for a name based on a mislocated tag

 When "git describe C" finds an annotated tag with tagname A to be
 the best name to explain commit C, and the tag is stored in a
 "wrong" place in the refs/tags hierarchy, e.g. refs/tags/B, the
 command gave a warning message but used A (not B) to describe C.
 If C is exactly at the tag, the describe output would be "A", but
 "git rev-parse A^0" would not be equal as "git rev-parse C^0".  The
 behavior of the command has been changed to use the "long" form
 i.e. A-0-gOBJECTNAME, which is correctly interpreted by rev-parse.

* hn/reftable (2020-02-26) 6 commits
 . Reftable support for git-core
 . Add reftable library
 . reftable: file format documentation
 . refs: document how ref_iterator_advance_fn should handle symrefs
 . create .git/refs in files-backend.c
 . refs.h: clarify reflog iteration order

 A new refs backend "reftable" to replace the traditional
 combination of packed-refs files and one-file-per-ref loose refs
 has been implemented and integrated for improved performance and
 atomicity.

 Temporarily ejected as this unfortunately conflicts with the
 SHA-256 topic.


* es/bugreport (2020-03-06) 6 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - bugreport: add compiler info
 - bugreport: add uname info
 - bugreport: gather git version and build info
 - bugreport: add tool to generate debugging info
 - help: move list_config_help to builtin/help

 The "bugreport" tool.

 As the scope of the topic got trimmed, hopefully these early parts
 can be polished quickly enough to be merged down.


* gs/commit-graph-path-filter (2020-02-12) 12 commits
 - (bytesex breakage band-aid)
 - commit-graph: add GIT_TEST_COMMIT_GRAPH_CHANGED_PATHS test flag
 - revision.c: use Bloom filters to speed up path based revision walks
 - commit-graph: add --changed-paths option to write subcommand
 - commit-graph: reuse existing Bloom filters during write.
 - commit-graph: write Bloom filters to commit graph file
 - commit-graph: examine commits by generation number
 - commit-graph: examine changed-path objects in pack order
 - commit-graph: compute Bloom filters for changed paths
 - diff: halt tree-diff early after max_changes
 - bloom: core Bloom filter implementation for changed paths
 - commit-graph: use MAX_NUM_CHUNKS

 Introduce an extension to the commit-graph to make it efficient to
 check for the paths that were modified at each commit using Bloom
 filters.

 Will be rerolled with bytesex fixes squashed in.
 Breakage due to byte-order dependency reported.

* jc/rebase-backend-keep-old-default (2020-03-10) 1 commit
 . rebase: do not switch the default to 'merge' just yet

 The "merge" backend of "git rebase" still has a few bugs and
 unexpected behaviour that need to be ironed out before it becomes
 the default.  Let's switch the default back to the "apply" backend
 for now.
