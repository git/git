What's cooking in git.git (Mar 2018, #01; Thu, 1)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

[Graduated to "master"]

* ab/untracked-cache-invalidation-docs (2018-02-09) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-14 at 11d2d07c4a)
 + update-index doc: note the caveat with "could not open..."
 + update-index doc: note a fixed bug in the untracked cache
 (this branch uses nd/fix-untracked-cache-invalidation.)

 Doc update to warn against remaining bugs in untracked cache.


* as/ll-i18n (2018-02-13) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-14 at b30154a04c)
 + Mark messages for translations

 Some messages in low level start-up codepath have been i18n-ized.

 + fsmonitor: update documentation to remove reference to invalid config settings

 Doc update for a recently added feature.


* bp/name-hash-dirname-fix (2018-02-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-14 at 2f564fb4b3)
 + name-hash: properly fold directory names in adjust_dirname_case()

 "git add" files in the same directory, but spelling the directory
 path in different cases on case insensitive filesystem, corrupted
 the name hash data structure and led to unexpected results.  This
 has been corrected.


* es/worktree-add-post-checkout-hook (2018-02-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-21 at 6ef6a130bf)
 + worktree: add: fix 'post-checkout' not knowing new worktree location

 "git worktree add" learned to run the post-checkout hook, just like
 "git clone" runs it upon the initial checkout.

  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-14 at 883d266e1e)
 + blame: tighten command line parser

 "git blame HEAD COPYING" in a bare repository failed to run, while
 "git blame HEAD -- COPYING" run just fine.  This has been corrected.


* jk/doc-do-not-write-extern (2018-02-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-14 at e55b5127de)
 + CodingGuidelines: mention "static" and "extern"

 Devdoc update.


* jk/gettext-poison (2018-02-08) 2 commits

 + git-sh-i18n: check GETTEXT_POISON before USE_GETTEXT_SCHEME
 + t0205: drop redundant test

 Test updates.

  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-21 at a037cbfa2b)
 + remote-curl: unquote incoming push-options
 + t5545: factor out http repository setup

 "git push" over http transport did not unquote the push-options
 correctly.


* jk/sq-dequote-on-bogus-input (2018-02-14) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-14 at 75d4f1eaf8)
 + sq_dequote: fix extra consumption of source string

 Code to unquote single-quoted string (used in the parser for
 configuration files, etc.) did not diagnose bogus input correctly
 and produced bogus results instead.


* jk/t0002-simplify (2018-02-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-14 at a7a24f5f29)
 + t0002: simplify error checking

 Code cleanup.


* jk/test-hashmap-updates (2018-02-14) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-14 at a61a9bd8f0)
 + test-hashmap: use "unsigned int" for hash storage
 + test-hashmap: simplify alloc_test_entry
 + test-hashmap: use strbuf_getline rather than fgets
 + test-hashmap: use xsnprintf rather than snprintf
 + test-hashmap: check allocation computation for overflow
 + test-hashmap: use ALLOC_ARRAY rather than bare malloc

 Code clean-up.


* js/fix-merge-arg-quoting-in-rebase-p (2018-02-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-14 at 27ebf001a1)
 + rebase -p: fix incorrect commit message when calling `git merge`.

 "git rebase -p" mangled log messages of a merge commit, which is
 now fixed.


* js/packet-read-line-check-null (2018-02-08) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-14 at 6ba237b284)
 + always check for NULL return from packet_read_line()
 + correct error messages for NULL packet_read_line()

 Some low level protocol codepath could crash when they get an
 unexpected flush packet, which is now fixed.


* jt/binsearch-with-fanout (2018-02-15) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-15 at 7648891022)
 + packfile: refactor hash search with fanout table
 + packfile: remove GIT_DEBUG_LOOKUP log statements
 (this branch is used by ds/commit-graph.)

 Refactor the code to binary search starting from a fan-out table
 (which is how the packfile is indexed with object names) into a
 reusable helper.


* nd/am-quit (2018-02-14) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-21 at 9a9cb40c2f)
 + am: support --quit

 "git am" has learned the "--quit" option, in addition to the existing
 "--abort" option; having the pair mirrors a few other commands like
 "rebase" and "cherry-pick".


* nd/fix-untracked-cache-invalidation (2018-02-07) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-08 at 23bd5a5d2d)
 + dir.c: ignore paths containing .git when invalidating untracked cache
 + dir.c: stop ignoring opendir() error in open_cached_dir()
 + dir.c: fix missing dir invalidation in untracked code
 + dir.c: avoid stat() in valid_cached_dir()
 + status: add a failing test showing a core.untrackedCache bug
 (this branch is used by ab/untracked-cache-invalidation-docs.)

 Some bugs around "untracked cache" feature have been fixed.
 Seems to uncover bad untracked cache information a bit too loudly,
 for which there is ab/untracked-cache-invalidation-docs topic.
 cf. <87d11omi2o.fsf@evledraar.gmail.com>
 They have to graduate together.


* rd/typofix (2018-02-14) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-14 at e770601de4)
 + Correct mispellings of ".gitmodule" to ".gitmodules"
 + t/: correct obvious typo "detahced"

 Typofix.


* rj/sparse-updates (2018-02-12) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-14 at 072df8ed5b)
 + Makefile: suppress a sparse warning for pack-revindex.c
 + config.mak.uname: remove SPARSE_FLAGS setting for cygwin

 Devtool update.


* rs/check-ignore-multi (2018-02-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-14 at 43cb0704af)
 + check-ignore: fix mix of directories and other file types

 "git check-ignore" with multiple paths got confused when one is a
 file and the other is a directory, which has been fixed.


* sb/describe-blob (2018-02-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-14 at 23e4c13944)
 + describe: confirm that blobs actually exist

 "git describe $garbage" stopped giving any errors when the garbage
 happens to be a string with 40 hexadecimal letters.

* sg/doc-test-must-fail-args (2018-02-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-14 at 28662d145b)
 + t: document 'test_must_fail ok=<signal-name>'

 Devdoc update.


* tg/worktree-create-tracking (2018-02-16) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-21 at 3e00a10cd8)
 + git-worktree.txt: fix indentation of example and text of 'add' command
 + git-worktree.txt: fix missing ")" typo

 Hotfix for a recent topic.


* tk/apply-dev-null-verify-name-fix (2018-02-15) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-21 at dab449203b)
 + apply: handle Subversion diffs with /dev/null gracefully
 + apply: demonstrate a problem applying svn diffs

 Many places in "git apply" knew that "/dev/null" that signals
 "there is no such file on this side of the diff" can be followed by
 whitespace and garbage when parsing a patch, except for one, which
 made an otherwise valid patch (e.g. ones from subversion) rejected.


* tz/do-not-clean-spec-file (2018-02-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-21 at c1336418a8)
 + Makefile: remove *.spec from clean target

 We no longer create any *.spec file, so "make clean" should not
 remove it.

 Test framework update.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ld/p4-unshelve (2018-02-22) 1 commit
 - git-p4: add unshelve command

 "git p4" learned to "unshelve" shelved commit from P4.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ms/non-ascii-ticks (2018-02-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-27 at 41159fc4f0)
 + Documentation/gitsubmodules.txt: avoid non-ASCII apostrophes

 Doc markup fix.

  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-27 at 56017cb5e2)
 + sequencer: factor out strbuf_read_file_or_whine()

 Code clean-up.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 Code clean-up.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* bw/perl-timegm-timelocal-fix (2018-02-23) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-27 at 565a3141ce)
 + perl: call timegm and timelocal with 4-digit year

 Y2k20 fix ;-) for our perl scripts.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ps/contains-id-error-message (2018-02-23) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-27 at 9623d6817b)
 + ref-filter: make "--contains <id>" less chatty if <id> is invalid

 "git tag --contains no-such-commit" gave a full list of options
 after giving an error message.

 Will merge to 'master'.
 As a follow-up we may want to also handle "branch --points-at <object>"
 that shares the same problem.


* rv/grep-cleanup (2018-02-23) 2 commits
 - grep: simplify grep_oid and grep_file
 - grep: move grep_source_init outside critical section

 Threaded "git grep" has been optimized to avoid allocation in code
 section that is covered under a mutex.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sg/subtree-signed-commits (2018-02-23) 1 commit
 - subtree: fix add and pull for GPG-signed commits

 "git subtree" script (in contrib/) scripted around "git log", whose
 output got affected by end-user configuration like log.showsignature

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ds/find-unique-abbrev-optim (2018-02-27) 1 commit
 - sha1_name: fix uninitialized memory errors

 While finding unique object name abbreviation, the code may
 accidentally have read beyond the end of the array of object names
 in a pack.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ds/mark-parents-uninteresting-optim (2018-02-27) 1 commit
 - revision.c: reduce object database queries

 Micro optimization in revision traversal code.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jc/test-must-be-empty (2018-02-27) 1 commit
 - test_must_be_empty: make sure the file exists, not just empty

 Test framework tweak to catch developer thinko.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ma/roll-back-lockfiles (2018-02-28) 5 commits
 - sequencer: do not roll back lockfile unnecessarily
 - merge: always roll back lock in `checkout_fast_forward()`
 - merge-recursive: always roll back lock in `merge_recursive_generic()`
 - sequencer: always roll back lock in `do_recursive_merge()`
 - sequencer: make lockfiles non-static
 (this branch is used by ma/skip-writing-unchanged-index.)

 Some codepaths used to take a lockfile and did not roll it back;
 they are automatically rolled back at program exit, so there is no
 real "breakage", but it still is a good practice to roll back when
 you are done with a lockfile.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* mk/doc-pretty-fill (2018-02-27) 1 commit
 - docs/pretty-formats: fix typo '% <(<N>)' -> '%<|(<N>)'

 Docfix.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 - repository.c: move env-related setup code back to environment.c
 (this branch uses sb/object-store; is tangled with sb/packfiles-in-repository.)

 - t5536: simplify checking of messages output to stderr
 - t4151: consolidate multiple calls to test_i18ngrep

 Refactoring the internal global data structure to make it possible
 to open multiple repositories, work with and then close them.


* sb/packfiles-in-repository (2018-02-28) 11 commits

 (this branch uses sb/object-store; is tangled with nd/remove-ignore-env-field.)


* sg/test-x (2018-02-28) 11 commits
 - travis-ci: run tests with '-x' tracing
 - t/README: add a note about don't saving stderr of compound commands
 - t1510-repo-setup: mark as untraceable with '-x'
 - t9903-bash-prompt: don't check the stderr of __git_ps1()
 - t5570-git-daemon: don't check the stderr of a subshell
 - t5526: use $TRASH_DIRECTORY to specify the path of GIT_TRACE log file
 - t5500-fetch-pack: don't check the stderr of a subshell
 - t3030-merge-recursive: don't check the stderr of a subshell
 - t1507-rev-parse-upstream: don't check the stderr of a shell function
 - t: add means to disable '-x' tracing for individual test scripts
 - t: prevent '-x' tracing from interfering with test helpers' stderr

 Running test scripts under -x option of the shell is often not a
 useful way to debug them, because the error messages from the
 commands tests try to capture and inspect are contaminated by the
 tracing output by the shell.  An earlier work done to make it more
 pleasant to run tests under -x with recent versions of bash is
 extended to cover posix shells that do not support BASH_XTRACEFD.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ab/gc-auto-in-commit (2018-03-01) 1 commit
 - commit: run git gc --auto just before the post-commit hook

 "git commit" used to run "gc --auto" near the end, which was lost
 when the command was reimplemented in C by mistake.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ab/pre-auto-gc-battery (2018-02-28) 1 commit
 - hooks/pre-auto-gc-battery: allow gc to run on non-laptops

 A sample auto-gc hook (in contrib/) to skip auto-gc while on
 battery has been updated to almost always allow running auto-gc
 unless on_ac_power command is absolutely sure that we are on
 battery power (earlier, it skipped unless the command is sure that
 we are on ac power).

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ag/userdiff-go-funcname (2018-03-01) 1 commit
 - userdiff: add built-in pattern for golang

 "git diff" and friends learned funcname patterns for Go language
 source files.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ma/skip-writing-unchanged-index (2018-03-01) 1 commit
 - write_locked_index(): add flag to avoid writing unchanged index
 (this branch uses ma/roll-back-lockfiles.)

 Internal API clean-up to allow write_locked_index() optionally skip
 writing the in-core index when it is not modified.

 May want to merge into ma/roll-back-lockfiles topic before merging
 to 'next'.

[Stalled]

* np/send-email-header-parsing (2017-12-15) 1 commit
 - send-email: extract email-parsing code into a subroutine

 Code refactoring.

 Undecided but inclined to drop.  A "refactor" without the code that
 benefit from the refactoring is hard to tell from code churn whose
 only effect is potential to introduce bugs.


* sg/travis-build-during-script-phase (2018-01-08) 1 commit
 - travis-ci: build Git during the 'script' phase

 Stalled for too long without any response; will discard.


* av/fsmonitor-updates (2018-01-04) 6 commits
 - fsmonitor: use fsmonitor data in `git diff`
 - fsmonitor: remove debugging lines from t/t7519-status-fsmonitor.sh
 - fsmonitor: make output of test-dump-fsmonitor more concise
 - fsmonitor: update helper tool, now that flags are filled later
 - fsmonitor: stop inline'ing mark_fsmonitor_valid / _invalid
 - dir.c: update comments to match argument name

 Code clean-up on fsmonitor integration, plus optional utilization
 of the fsmonitor data in diff-files.

 Waiting for an update.

* dj/runtime-prefix (2017-12-05) 4 commits
 . exec_cmd: RUNTIME_PREFIX on some POSIX systems
 . Makefile: add Perl runtime prefix support
 . Makefile: add support for "perllibdir"
 . Makefile: generate Perl header from template file

 A build-time option has been added to allow Git to be told to refer
 to its associated files relative to the main binary, in the same
 way that has been possible on Windows for quite some time, for
 Linux, BSDs and Darwin.

 Perhaps it is about time to reboot the effort?


* mk/http-backend-content-length (2017-11-27) 4 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - t5560-http-backend-noserver.sh: add CONTENT_LENGTH cases
 - SQUASH???
 - http-backend: respect CONTENT_LENGTH as specified by rfc3875

 The http-backend (used for smart-http transport) used to slurp the
 whole input until EOF, without paying attention to CONTENT_LENGTH
 that is supplied in the environment and instead expecting the Web
 server to close the input stream.  This has been fixed.

 Expecting a reroll.
 Suggested fixes to be used when rerolling is queued, but I'd
 prefer _not_ squashing them myself.

 Also, it may be too complex solution for the problem.

* cc/require-tcl-tk-for-build (2017-11-29) 2 commits
 - travis-ci: avoid new tcl/tk build requirement
 - Makefile: check that tcl/tk is installed

 A first-time builder of Git may have installed neither tclsh nor
 msgfmt, in which case git-gui and gitk part will fail and break the
 build.  As a workaround, refuse to run a build when tclsh is not
 installed and NO_TCLTK is not set.

 Stalled for too long without any response; will discard.
 I still feel that requring tclsh to be installed, with or without
 "escape hatch" for experts, may be too heavy-handed.


* mg/merge-base-fork-point (2017-09-17) 3 commits
 - merge-base: find fork-point outside partial reflog
 - merge-base: return fork-point outside reflog
 - t6010: test actual test output

 "merge-base --fork-point $branch $commit" is used to guess on which
 commit among the commits that were once at the tip of the $branch the
 $commit was built on top of, and it learns these historical tips from
 the reflog of the $branch.  When the true fork-point is lost due to
 pruning of old reflog entries, the command does not give any output,
 because it has no way to guess correctly and does not want to mislead
 the user with a wrong guess.

 The command has been updated to give the best but not known to be
 correct guess, based on a hope that a merge-base between $commit and a
 virtual merge across all the reflog entries that still are available
 for $branch may still be a closer to the true fork-point than the
 merge-base between $commit and the current tip of the $branch.

 This may have to be offered by an additional option, to allow the
 users that are prepared to see a potentially incorrect guess to opt
 into the feature, without affecting the current callers that may not
 be prepared to accept a guess that is not known to be correct.

 . zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

 Needs resurrecting by making sure the fix is good and still applies
 (or adjusted to today's codebase).


* mg/status-in-progress-info (2017-05-10) 2 commits

 "git status" learns an option to report various operations
 (e.g. "merging") that the user is in the middle of.

* jc/allow-ff-merging-kept-tags (2018-02-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-27 at 8b03610d2b)
 + merge: allow fast-forward when merging a tracked tag

 Since Git 1.7.9, "git merge" defaulted to --no-ff (i.e. even when
 the side branch being merged is a descendant of the current commit,
 create a merge commit instead of fast-forwarding) when merging a
 tag object.  This was appropriate default for integrators who pull
 signed tags from their downstream contributors, but caused an
 unnecessary merges when used by downstream contributors who
 habitually "catch up" their topic branches with tagged releases
 from the upstream.  Update "git merge" to default to --no-ff only
 when merging a tag object that does *not* sit at its usual place in
 refs/tags/ hierarchy, and allow fast-forwarding otherwise, to
 mitigate the problem.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 - config: change default of `pager.config` to "on"
 - config: respect `pager.config` in list/get-mode only
 - t7006: add tests for how git config paginates

 In a way similar to how "git tag" learned to honor the pager
 setting only in the list mode, "git config" learned to ignore the
 pager setting when it is used for setting values (i.e. when the
 purpose of the operation is not to "show").

 - t3701: use test_write_lines and write_script
 - t3701: indent here documents
 - add -i: add function to format hunk header

 "git add -p" has been lazy in coalescing split patches before
 passing the result to underlying "git apply", leading to corner
 case bugs; the logic to prepare the patch to be applied after hunk
 selections has been tightened.

 + add -p: only bind search key if there's more than one hunk

 "git add -p" used to offer "/" (look for a matching hunk) as a
 choice, even there was only one hunk, which has been corrected.
 Also the single-key help is now given only for keys that are
 enabled (e.g. help for '/' won't be shown when there is only one

 information usually given with the "--summary" option on the same
 line as the diffstat output of the "--stat" option (which saves
 vertical space and keeps info on a single path at the same place).

 Rename detection logic in "diff" family that is used in "merge" has
 learned to guess when all of x/a, x/b and x/c have moved to z/a,
 z/b and z/c, it is likely that x/d added in the meantime would also
 want to move to z/d by taking the hint that the entire directory
 'x' moved to 'z'.  A bug causing dirty files involved in a rename
 to be overwritten during merge has also been fixed as part of this
 work.

 Will merge to 'next'.
