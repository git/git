What's cooking in git.git (Mar 2012, #05; Sun, 11)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.

I think the tip of 'master' is more or less complete for -rc1; I'll
start ignoring new feature patches out of blue and low impact fix
patches that are not very well cooked, expecting for them to be
rerolled after 1.7.10 final.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches of the
repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* ab/perl-i18n (2012-03-10) 3 commits
 - fixup! de1e4ae
 - perl/Makefile: install Git::I18N under NO_PERL_MAKEMAKER
 - Git::I18N: compatibility with perl <5.8.3

Attempts to help installations with ancient Perl and/or without
MakeMaker.  Didn't quite work for me, so I tried to queue a fix-up
commit, but an independent confirmation report is needed before it
is squashed into Ævar's patches.

* jc/commit-hook-authorship (2012-03-11) 3 commits
 - commit: pass author/committer info to hooks
 - t7503: does pre-commit-hook learn authorship?
 - ident.c: add split_ident_line() to parse formatted ident line
 (this branch is tangled with jc/run-hook-env-1.)

"git commit --author=$name" did not tell the name that was being
recorded in the resulting commit to hooks, even though it does do so
when the end user overrode the authorship via the "GIT_AUTHOR_NAME"
environment variable.  This is a simpler of the two approaches.

* jc/run-hook-env-1 (2012-03-11) 4 commits
 . commit: pass author/committer info to hooks
 - run_hook(): enhance the interface to pass arbitrary environment
 - t7503: does pre-commit-hook learn authorship?
 - ident.c: add split_ident_line() to parse formatted ident line
 (this branch is tangled with jc/commit-hook-authorship.)

Addresses the same issue, sharing the first two changes with the
previous one, but uses a more complex approach, which may not be
worth the complexity.  The third patch is a prerequiste for the
fourth one (not used), but is independently useful.

* jn/maint-fast-import-empty-ls (2012-03-09) 2 commits
 - fast-import: don't allow 'ls' of path with empty components
 - fast-import: leakfix for 'ls' of dirty trees

* ms/maint-config-error-at-eol-linecount (2012-03-11) 1 commit
 - config: report errors at the EOL with correct line number

* jc/diff-algo-cleanup (2012-02-19) 2 commits
 - xdiff: PATIENCE/HISTOGRAM are not independent option bits
 - xdiff: remove XDL_PATCH_* macros
 (this branch is used by jc/diff-ignore-case.)

Resurrects the preparatory clean-up patches from another topic
that was discarded.

* cn/apply-fix-ws-can-lengthen-lines (2012-03-11) 1 commit
 . apply: reallocate the postimage buffer when needed

Attempts to address an ancient bug that dates back to the addition
of an oddball "tab-in-indent" whitespace breakage class that wants
to have longer lines than the original when fixing things up.

Needs more work; results in double-frees.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* dg/test-from-elsewhere (2012-03-04) 2 commits
 - Support out-of-tree Valgrind tests
 - Allow overriding GIT_BUILD_DIR

Better support for out-of-tree test scripts, but it appears that the
approach needs to be rethought.  By repointing TEST_DIRECTORY to a
directory other than $(pwd)/.., an out of place test script can reach
test helpers and freshly built Git relative to it (GIT_BUILD_DIR is
a mere short-hand for $TEST_DIRECTORY/..).

* nd/optim-connected (2012-02-29) 1 commit
 - Perform cheaper connectivity check when pack is used as medium

Cheats the local connectivity check performed by "git fetch"
slightly to gain some performance. This is a bit iffy.

* nd/columns (2012-02-28) 10 commits
 - tag: add --column
 - column: support piping stdout to external git-column process
 - status: add --column
 - branch: add --column
 - help: reuse print_columns() for help -a
 - column: add column.ui for default column output settings
 - column: add dense layout support
 - column: add columnar layout
 - Stop starting pager recursively
 - Add git-column for columnar display

Rerolled; the configuration handling looked iffy, but otherwise well
explained.

* hv/submodule-recurse-push (2012-02-13) 3 commits
 - push: teach --recurse-submodules the on-demand option
 - Refactor submodule push check to use string list instead of integer
 - Teach revision walking machinery to walk multiple times sequencially

The bottom one was not clearly explained and needs a reroll.

* jc/advise-push-default (2011-12-18) 1 commit
 - push: hint to use push.default=upstream when appropriate

Peff had a good suggestion outlining an updated code structure so
that somebody new can try to dip his or her toes in the development.
Any takers?

* jh/trace-use-startup-info (2012-03-02) 1 commit
 - Use startup_info->prefix rather than prefix.

I tend to agree with the doubt of the author of this patch expressed.

* ss/git-svn-prompt-sans-terminal (2012-01-04) 3 commits
 - fixup! 15eaaf4
 - git-svn, perl/Git.pm: extend Git::prompt helper for querying users
 - perl/Git.pm: "prompt" helper to honor GIT_ASKPASS and SSH_ASKPASS

The bottom one has been replaced with a rewrite based on comments
from Ævar. The second one needs more work, both in perl/Git.pm and
prompt.c, to give precedence to tty over SSH_ASKPASS when terminal
is available.

* jc/split-blob (2012-02-23) 7 commits
 - fixup?
 - chunked-object: streaming checkout
 - chunked-object: fallback checkout codepaths
 - bulk-checkin: support chunked-object encoding
 - bulk-checkin: allow the same data to be multiply hashed
 - new representation types in the packstream
 - varint-in-pack: refactor varint encoding/decoding

Not ready.

I finished the streaming checkout codepath, but as explained in
127b177 (bulk-checkin: support chunked-object encoding, 2011-11-30),
these are still early steps of a long and painful journey. At least
pack-objects and fsck need to learn the new encoding for the series
to be usable locally, and then index-pack/unpack-objects needs to
learn it to be used remotely.

Given that I heard a lot of noise that people want large files, and
that I was asked by somebody at GitTogether'11 privately for an
advice on how to pay developers (not me) to help adding necessary
support, I am somewhat dissapointed that the original patch series
that was sent almost two months ago still remains here without much
comments and updates from the developer community. I even made the
interface to the logic that decides where to split chunks easily
replaceable, and I deliberately made the logic in the original patch
extremely stupid to entice others, especially the "bup" fanboys, to
come up with a better logic, thinking that giving people an easy
target to shoot for, they may be encouraged to help out. The plan is
not working :-(.

[Cooking]

* rs/unpack-trees-leakfix (2012-03-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-03-07 at 69a69cd)
 + unpack-trees: plug minor memory leak

Will defer til 1.7.10.

* jh/apply-free-patch (2012-03-07) 1 commit
 - apply: do not leak patches and fragments

* az/verify-tag-use-gpg-config (2012-03-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-03-09 at d9e556f)
 + verify-tag: Parse GPG configuration options.

"git tag -s" honored "gpg.program" configuration variable since
1.7.9, but "git tag -v" and "git verify-tag" didn't.

This is a fairly low impact fix.
Will merge to 'master'.

* tb/maint-remove-irrelevant-i18n-test (2012-03-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-03-07 at 23f2dd1)
 + t0204: remove a test that checks undefined behaviour

I tentatively parked this in 'next' but later reverted the merge.
Will discard.

* jc/maint-undefined-i18n-observation-test (2012-03-09) 1 commit
 - t0204: clarify the "observe undefined behaviour" test

It was unclear what a test in t0204 wanted to check; it turns out
that it was only to observe an undefined behaviour of the system,
and did not anticipate one kind of reasonable error behaviour.

Replaces the tb/maint-remove-irrelevant-i18n-test topic.

We may want merge this before 1.7.10 to help Mac OS X builders.

* mm/push-default-switch-warning (2012-03-09) 1 commit
 - push: start warning upcoming default change for push.default

This resurrects an ancient patch I wrote during a discussion we had
in the 1.6.3-1.6.4 era.  It also conflicts with the long-stalled
jc/advise-push-default topic and for a good reason---they address a
similar issue.  The latter is a lower impact patch that uses a more
focused approach to limit the scope to the target audience that
actually needs help.

* ph/rerere-doc (2012-03-08) 1 commit
 - rerere: Document 'rerere remaining'

Ping?

* sl/customize-sane-tool-path (2012-03-09) 1 commit
 - configure: allow user to prevent $PATH "sanitization" on Solaris

Would be nice to hear from people who actually use autoconf, either
on Solaris or other platforms.

* jc/fmt-merge-msg-people (2012-03-08) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-03-08 at be31aa9)
 + fmt-merge-msg.c: make util_as_int() return "int"
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-03-07 at 76fbac3)
 + fmt-merge-msg: finishing touches
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-03-05 at 38de349)
 + fmt-merge-msg: show those involved in a merged series

The "fmt-merge-msg" command learns to list the primary contributors
involved in the side topic you are merging.

Will defer til 1.7.10.

* nl/http-proxy-more (2012-03-05) 3 commits
 - http: handle proxy authentication failure (error 407)
 - http: handle proxy proactive authentication
 - http: try http_proxy env var when http.proxy config option is not set

The code to talk to http proxies learn to use the same credential
API used to talk to the final http destinations.  It seems the
re-rolling has stalled since the last review?

* nd/stream-more (2012-03-07) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-03-07 at 7325922)
 + update-server-info: respect core.bigfilethreshold
 + fsck: use streaming API for writing lost-found blobs
 + show: use streaming API for showing blobs
 + parse_object: avoid putting whole blob in core
 + cat-file: use streaming API to print blobs
 + Add more large blob test cases
 + streaming: make streaming-write-entry to be more reusable

Use API to read blob data in smaller chunks in more places to
reduce the memory footprint.  In general, looked fairly good.

Will defer til 1.7.10.

* nd/threaded-index-pack (2012-03-11) 2 commits
 - index-pack: support multithreaded delta resolving
 - index-pack: split second pass obj handling into own function

Another reroll after a bugreport on pthread usage discovered by
Ramsey.
