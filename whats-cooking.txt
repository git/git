What's cooking in git.git (Feb 2010, #05; Sun, 21)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones
marked with '.' do not appear in any of the integration branches, but I am
still holding onto them.

--------------------------------------------------

Based on 1.6.5 maintenance track, later to be merged to 1.6.X maintenance
series if needed.

* sp/push-sideband (2010-02-10) 0 commits
 (this branch uses sp/maint-push-sideband.)

* jc/checkout-detached (2010-01-29) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-02-17 at 7e03edc)
 + Reword "detached HEAD" notification

* jc/maint-fix-test-perm (2010-01-30) 2 commits

 + lib-patch-mode.sh: Fix permission
 + t6000lib: Fix permission

* jn/makefile-script-lib (2010-01-31) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-02-16 at f5334f5)
 + Do not install shell libraries executable

  (merged to 'next' on 2010-02-16 at be03aad)

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* dp/read-not-mmap-small-loose-object (2010-02-21) 1 commit
 - hash-object: don't use mmap() for small files

I treaked the cut-off based on my reading of Dmitry's numbers.

* np/compress-loose-object-memsave (2010-02-20) 1 commit
 . sha1_file: don't malloc the whole compressed result when writing out objects

* jc/maint-add-paranoid (2010-02-19) 2 commits
 - paranoid: avoid unnecessary re-hashing
 - Teach "git add" and friends to be paranoid

This conflicts rather badly with more logical change by Nicolas in the
other thread; perhaps we should drop this "paranoia" for now.

* jc/maint-fix-mailinfo-strip (2010-02-19) 1 commit
 - mailinfo: do not strip leading spaces even for a header line

Linus noticed that an indented first line in the log message body loses
its indentation.  Lukas sent a lot more intrusive patch to keep the
removal of leading spaces for header lines while avoiding this issue, but
I think removing the leading blanks is wrong in either the message or
in-body header.

* ne/pack-local-doc (2010-02-18) 1 commit
 - Documentation: pack-objects: Clarify --local's semantics.

Comments from pack experts?

* ml/connect-refactor (2010-02-17) 1 commit
 - connect.c: move duplicated code to a new function 'get_host_and_port'

* ml/encode-header-refactor (2010-02-16) 1 commit
 - refactor duplicated encode_header in pack-objects and fast-import

* ml/fill-mm-refactor (2010-02-16) 1 commit
 - refactor duplicated fill_mm() in checkout and merge-recursive

These three should be safe for 'next' but I postponed them because they
were distractions compared to other topics I wanted to proccess first.

* mm/mkstemps-mode-for-packfiles (2010-02-20) 6 commits
 - Use git_mkstemp_mode instead of plain mkstemp to create object files
 - git_mkstemps_mode: do not overwrite errno
 - Use git_mkstemp_mode and xmkstemp_mode in odb_mkstemp, not chmod later.
 - git_mkstemp_mode, xmkstemp_mode: variants of gitmkstemps with mode argument.
 - Move gitmkstemps to path.c
 - Add a testcase for ACL with restrictive umask.

The test does not seem to pass for me.

* rs/optim-text-wrap (2010-02-19) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-02-21 at 70ef189)
 + utf8.c: speculatively assume utf-8 in strbuf_add_wrapped_text()
 + utf8.c: remove strbuf_write()
 + utf8.c: remove print_spaces()
 + utf8.c: remove print_wrapped_text()

* tr/maint-cherry-pick-list (2010-02-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-02-21 at 65fded0)
 + cherry_pick_list: quit early if one side is empty

* tc/transport-verbosity (2010-02-18) 9 commits
 - transport: update flags to be in running order
 - pull: learn --progress
 - fetch: learn --progress
 - push: learn --progress
 - transport->progress: use flag authoritatively
 - clone: support multiple levels of verbosity
 - push: support multiple levels of verbosity
 - fetch: refactor verbosity option handling into transport.[ch]
 - Documentation/git-push.txt: put --quiet before --verbose

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* ld/push-porcelain (2010-02-09) 4 commits
 - git-push: fix an error message so it goes to stderr
 - git-push: make git push --dry-run --porcelain exit with status 0 even if updates will be rejected
 - git-push: send "To <remoteurl>" messages to the standard output in --porcelain mode
 - git-push: squelch advice message if in --porcelain mode

This needs further simplification, judging from the previous discussion?

* ld/maint-diff-quiet-w (2010-02-16) 1 commit
 - git diff --quiet -w: check and report the status

Needs tests but otherwise looked Ok.

* sd/format-patch-to (2010-02-17) 1 commit
 - Add 'git format-patch --to=' option and 'format.to' configuration variable.

Shouldn't be too hard to add tests to t4014; other than that looked ready
for 'next'.

* sd/init-template (2010-02-17) 2 commits
 - Add a "TEMPLATE DIRECTORY" section to git-init[1].
 - Add `init.templatedir` configuration variable.

Shouldn't be too hard to add tests to t0001; other than that looked ready
for 'next'.

* sd/log-decorate (2010-02-17) 3 commits
 - log.decorate: usability fixes
 - Add `log.decorate' configuration variable.
 - git_config_maybe_bool()

Probably ready for 'next', except that people need to be warned about
having to update their scripts to explicitly pass --no-decorate to keep
them working.

* pb/log-first-parent-p-m (2010-02-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-02-17 at 2f8e5ae)
 + git log -p -m: document -m and honor --first-parent

Needs tests but otherwise looked fine.  We might want to teach "-m trumps
implicit --cc" to "git show", but that is a totally separate topic.

* js/rebase-origin-x (2010-02-05) 1 commit
 - [RFC w/o test and incomplete] rebase: add -x option to record original commit name

I retract my objection against the idea of -x; needs polishing before
moving forward.

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* cp/add-u-pathspec (2010-02-09) 2 commits
 - test for add with non-existent pathspec
 - git add -u: die on unmatched pathspec

I am a bit torn on this one.  Traditionally we never complained on
unmatched pathspec when talking about tracked files.  If we were to go
this route, I think we should probably enhance the "run_diff_files" and
friends in such a way that they mark matched pathspecs, in a way similar
to match_pathspec() in dir.c does, and report unmatched ones based on
that result, instead of adding an extra pass to scan the index.  The same
goes for pathspec_matches() in builtin-grep.c

Incidentally, I've proposed "pathspec unification" as possible GSoC'10
project---with luck, we might finally see a progress on this front ;-)

* jc/for-each-ref (2010-02-13) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-02-21 at c9a6c2f)
 + for-each-ref --format='%(flag)'
 + for-each-ref --format='%(symref) %(symref:short)'
 + builtin-for-each-ref.c: check if we need to peel onion while parsing the format
 + builtin-for-each-ref.c: comment fixes

* jn/gitweb-config-error-die (2010-02-14) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-02-21 at e3ecd65)
 + gitweb: Die if there are parsing errors in config file

* jn/maint-fix-pager (2010-02-20) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-02-21 at 640e10c)
 + t7006-pager: if stdout is not a terminal, make a new one
 + tests: Add tests for automatic use of pager
 + am: Fix launching of pager
 + git svn: Fix launching of pager
 + git.1: Clarify the behavior of the --paginate option
 + Make 'git var GIT_PAGER' always print the configured pager
 + Fix 'git var' usage synopsis

  (merged to 'next' on 2010-02-21 at d52c051)

A potential clean-up sent as a counter-proposal; waiting for response.
