What's cooking in git.git (May 2023, #06; Fri, 19)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a future
release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and aren't
considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL to a
message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity.

Git 2.41-rc1 has been tagged.  Thanks for catching and fixing a few
regressions that escaped to the 'master' front so quickly, everybody.

Starting next week, until early June, my availability may be
sporadic, but this time I won't be completely away from the keyboard
to require an interrim maintainer.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

Release tarballs are available at:

* bc/clone-empty-repo-via-protocol-v0 (2023-05-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2023-05-17 at d320de7ee9)
 + upload-pack: advertise capabilities when cloning empty repos

 The server side of "git clone" now advertises the necessary hints
 to clients to help them to clone from an empty repository and learn
 object hash algorithm and the (unborn) branch pointed at by HEAD,
 even over the older v0/v1 protocol.

  (merged to 'next' on 2023-05-17 at fa1900a383)
 + send-email: clear the $message_id after validation

 When "git send-email" that uses the validate hook is fed a message
 without and then with Message-ID, it failed to auto-assign a unique
 Message-ID to the former and instead reused the Message-ID from the
 latter, which has been corrected.  This was a fix for a recent
 regression caught before the release, so no need to mention it in
 the release notes.

 We started unconditionally testing with CGIPassAuth directive but
 it is unavailable in older Apache that ships with CentOS 7 that has
 about a year of shelf-life still left.  The test has conditionally
 been disabled when running with an ancient Apache.  This was a fix
 for a recent regression caught before the release, so no need to
 mention it in the release notes.

* tb/pack-bitmap-traversal-with-boundary (2023-05-08) 3 commits
 - pack-bitmap.c: use commit boundary during bitmap traversal
 - pack-bitmap.c: extract `fill_in_bitmap()`
 - object: add object_array initializer helper function

 The object traversal using reachability bitmap done by
 "pack-object" has been tweaked to take advantage of the fact that
 using "boundary" commits as representative of all the uninteresting
 ones can save quite a lot of object enumeration.
