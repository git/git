What's cooking in git.git (Dec 2011, #02; Mon, 5)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with '+' are in
'next'.

The tip of 'next' will be rewound soonish, kicking a handful of topics
back to 'pu' that are important enough to get them right rather than
piling "oops, that was a mistake" fix-ups in 'next'.

All of the topics in Stalled section will be purged without prejudice;
owners of respective topics are free to re-submit after addressing the
issues raised during the previous reviews and re-ignite the discussion.

Here are the repositories that have my integration branches:

With maint, master, next, pu, todo:

        git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git
        git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git
        https://code.google.com/p/git-core/
        https://github.com/git/git

With only maint and master:

        git://git.sourceforge.jp/gitroot/git-core/git.git
        git://git-core.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/git-core/git-core

With all the topics and integration branches:

        https://github.com/gitster/git

The preformatted documentation in HTML and man format are found in:

Will merge to 'next'.

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* ab/clang-lints (2011-11-06) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-11-13 at a573aec)
 + cast variable in call to free() in builtin/diff.c and submodule.c
 + apply: get rid of useless x < 0 comparison on a size_t type

* gh/userdiff-matlab (2011-11-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-11-18 at 10cd275)

* jc/maint-pack-object-cycle (2011-11-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-11-18 at 3715a81)
 + pack-object: tolerate broken packs that have duplicated objects

Make the client side more robust against bogus pack stream; the problem
was discovered by accident while repacking a clone obtained from somewhat
buggy test server.

* jc/index-pack-reject-dups (2011-11-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-11-18 at 2090221)
 + receive-pack, fetch-pack: reject bogus pack that records objects twice

And this is the prevention to reject such pack stream in the first place.

* jk/refresh-porcelain-output (2011-11-18) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-11-18 at 872f25e)

 + http.c: Rely on select instead of tracking whether data was received
 + http.c: Use timeout suggested by curl instead of fixed 50ms timeout

Reduces unnecessary waits.

* na/strtoimax (2011-11-05) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-11-14 at b64e1cb)
 + Support sizes >=2G in various config options accepting 'g' sizes.
 + Compatibility: declare strtoimax() under NO_STRTOUMAX
 + Add strtoimax() compatibility function.

  (merged to 'next' on 2011-11-13 at 8831811)
 + fsck: print progress

 + verify_packfile(): check as many object as possible in a pack
 + fsck: return error code when verify_pack() goes wrong

 (this branch is used by nd/ignore-might-be-precious.)

* nd/misc-cleanups (2011-10-27) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-10-28 at 2527a49)
 + unpack_object_header_buffer(): clear the size field upon error

  (merged to 'next' on 2011-11-14 at f46d021)
 + MSVC: Remove unneeded header stubs
 + Compile fix for MSVC: Include <io.h>
 + Compile fix for MSVC: Do not include sys/resources.h

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

All of the topics in Stalled section will be discarded soonish (see the
cover).

* hv/submodule-merge-search (2011-10-13) 4 commits
 - submodule.c: make two functions static
 - allow multiple calls to submodule merge search for the same path
 - push: Don't push a repository with unpushed submodules
 - push: teach --recurse-submodules the on-demand option

What the topic aims to achieve may make sense, but the implementation
looked somewhat suboptimal.

* sr/transport-helper-fix-rfc (2011-07-19) 2 commits
 - t5800: point out that deleting branches does not work
 - t5800: document inability to push new branch with old content

See comments on sr/fix-fast-export-tips topic.

* sr/fix-fast-export-tips (2011-11-05) 3 commits
 - fast-export: output reset command for commandline revs
 - fast-export: do not refer to non-existing marks
 - t9350: point out that refs are not updated correctly

The bottom commit from the stalled sr/transport-helper-fix-rfc topic is
fixed with this. It may make sense to drop the other topic and include
that commit in this series.

The command line parser is still too lax and accepts malformed input, but
this is a step in the right direction and tightening the command line now
should be doable without a low level surgery that touches codepaths that
are unrelated to the command line processing like the previous attempt
used to do.

* jc/lookup-object-hash (2011-08-11) 6 commits
 - object hash: replace linear probing with 4-way cuckoo hashing
 - object hash: we know the table size is a power of two
 - object hash: next_size() helper for readability
 - pack-objects --count-only
 - object.c: remove duplicated code for object hashing
 - object.c: code movement for readability

I do not think there is anything fundamentally wrong with this series, but
the risk of breakage far outweighs observed performance gain in one
particular workload.

* jc/verbose-checkout (2011-10-16) 2 commits
 - checkout -v: give full status output after switching branches
 - checkout: move the local changes report to the end

This is just to leave a record that the reason why we do not do this not
because we are incapable of coding this, but because it is not a good idea
to do this. I suspect people who are new to git that might think they need
it would soon realize the don't.

Will drop.

* eh/grep-scale-to-cpunum (2011-11-05) 1 commit
 - grep: detect number of CPUs for thread spawning

Kills I/O parallelism and needs to be improved or discarded.

* jc/commit-tree-extra (2011-11-12) 2 commits
 - commit-tree: teach -C <extra-commit>
 - commit-tree: teach -x <extra>
 (this branch uses jc/pull-signed-tag; is tangled with jc/signed-commit.)

Not absolutely needed; parked in 'pu' but may drop.

* cb/daemon-permission-errors (2011-10-17) 2 commits
 - daemon: report permission denied error to clients
 - daemon: add tests

The tip commit might be loosening things a bit too much.

--------------------------------------------------

 (this branch uses jc/pull-signed-tag; is tangled with jc/commit-tree-extra.)

Not exactly urgent.
Will concentrate on getting jc/pull-signed-tag in first.

* jc/pull-signed-tag (2011-11-12) 15 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-11-14 at 25e8838)

Will merge to 'master'.

* jc/request-pull-show-head-4 (2011-11-09) 12 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-11-13 at e473fd2)

Will merge to 'master'.

* ab/pull-rebase-config (2011-11-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-11-13 at 72bb2d5)

 - finish_tmp_packfile(): a helper function
 - create_tmp_packfile(): a helper function
 - write_pack_header(): a helper function
 (this branch is used by jc/split-blob.)

Teaches "git add" to send large-ish blob data straight to a packfile.
This is a continuation to the "large file support" topic. The codepath to
move data from worktree to repository is made aware of streaming, just
like the checkout codepath that goes the other way, which was done in the
previous "large file support" topic in the 1.7.7 cycle.

Will merge to 'next'.

The internals of "git revert/cherry-pick" has been further refactored to
serve as the basis for the sequencer.

Is this ready for 'master', or should we eject it to 'pu', expecing a
re-roll?
