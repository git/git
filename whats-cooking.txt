What's cooking in git.git (Jul 2024, #02; Mon, 8)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and
aren't considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL
to a message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity (of course they can be resubmit when new interests
arise).

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-scm/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/

[New Topics]

* jc/checkout-no-op-switch-errors (2024-07-02) 1 commit
 - checkout: special case error messages during noop switching

 "git checkout --ours" (no other arguments) complained that the
 option is incompatible with branch switching, which is technically
 correct, but found confusing by some users.  It now says that the
 user needs to give pathspec to specify what paths to checkout.

 harmless error message when push negotiation is configured, which

 - patch-id: tighten code to detect the patch header
 - patch-id: rewrite code that detects the beginning of a patch
 - patch-id: make get_one_patchid() more extensible
 - patch-id: call flush_current_id() only when needed
 - t4204: patch-id supports various input format

 The patch parser in "git patch-id" has been tightened to avoid
 getting confused by lines that look like a patch header in the log
 message.

 Needs review.
