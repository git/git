What's cooking in git.git (Mar 2021, #05; Wed, 17)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'seen' (formerly 'pu'---proposed updates) while commits prefixed
with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

Git 2.31 has been tagged.  We will hopefully either (1) not see
brown-paper-bag breakages at all, or (2) will see some but can
immediately deal with them, in coming couple of days.  After that,
the 2.32 cycle will gain steam, starting next week.  Let's see.

Many topics marked as "Will cook in 'next'" should be marked for
merging to 'master' now, but that hasn't happened yet.  Please
nominate those that should be kicked back from 'next' to 'seen', if
there are any.  Please also nominate those that should be among the
first batch of topics to be in 'master' (after a handful of 2.31
regression fixes go through 'next' down to 'master', that is).

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/

 I am not exactly sure where this series wants to go, other than
 unnecessarily churning the code.  Seems to break "diff --no-index"
 rather badly, too (e.g. t4050, t4002, among others).


* jh/fsmonitor-prework (2021-03-17) 1 commit
 - fsmonitor: avoid global-buffer-overflow READ when checking trivial response

 The fsmonitor interface read from its input without making sure

 "git stash show" learned to optionally show untracked part of the
 stash.

 Will cook in 'next'.

* ab/tests-cleanup-around-sha1 (2021-03-10) 4 commits
 - tests: get rid of $_x05 from the test suite
 - shortlog tests: rewrite to get rid of --abbrev=35 hardcoding
 - test-lib: remove unused $_x40 and $_z40 variables
 - git-bisect: remove unused SHA-1 $x40 shell variable

 Remove variables that hold regexp and glob that match fixed number
 of hexadecimal digits from the test suite.

 Expecting a reroll.
 At least the last one weakens a test and should be dropped; there
 may be similar breakage due to not understanding what they are
 trying to test.


* jk/filter-branch-sha256 (2021-03-10) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-03-14 at e4e624590a)
 + filter-branch: drop $_x40 glob
 + filter-branch: drop multiple-ancestor warning
 + t7003: test ref rewriting explicitly

 Code clean-up.

 Will cook in 'next'.
 In the longer term, we might want to remove filter-branch and nudge
 folks to more modern tools.


* ab/make-cocci-dedup (2021-03-12) 5 commits
 - Makefile/coccicheck: use --include-headers-for-types
 - Makefile/coccicheck: set SPATCH_BATCH_SIZE to 8
 - Makefile/coccicheck: allow for setting xargs concurrency
 - Makefile/coccicheck: speed up and fix bug with duplicate hunks
 - Makefile/coccicheck: add comment heading for all SPATCH flags

 Coccicheck update.

 Expecting a reroll.
 IIUC, the "speed up" claimed in the intermediate steps are all gone
 when correctness is brought back in with the last step.  The series
 needs a restructuring to avoid confuing readers with "it produces
 incorrect result very quickly" followed by "we now produce right
 result, even more correct than the original, but we are not all
 that fast" progression.


* ab/read-tree (2021-03-17) 9 commits
 - tree.h API: expose read_tree_1() as read_tree_at()
 - show tests: add test for "git show <tree>"
 - tree.h API: rename read_tree_recursive() to read_tree()
 - tree.h API: remove "stage" parameter from read_tree_recursive()
 - tree.h API: remove support for starting at prefix != ""
 - ls-files: refactor away read_tree()
 - ls-files: don't needlessly pass around stage variable
 - tree.c API: move read_tree() into builtin/ls-files.c
 - ls-files tests: add meaningful --with-tree tests
 (this branch is used by ab/tree-walk-with-object-type.)

 Code simplification by removing support for a caller that is long gone.

 Expecting a reroll.
 Mostly good, but the progression shows "oops we screwed up" earlier
 in the series that is then fixed later.


* ab/unexpected-object-type (2021-03-08) 7 commits
 - tag: don't misreport type of tagged objects in errors
 - object tests: add test for unexpected objects in tags
 - object.c: add a utility function for "expected type X, got Y"
 - tree.c: fix misindentation in parse_tree_gently()
 - oid_object_info(): return "enum object_type"
 - object.c: make type_from_string() return "enum object_type"
 - object.c: refactor type_from_string_gently()

 Error reporting upon object type mismatch has been improved

 Expecting a reroll.
 Looked good except for some rewrites.

 very basic set of tests.

 which has been corrected.

 Will cook in 'next'.

 We had a code to diagnose and die cleanly when a required

 - commit: add amend suboption to --fixup to create amend! commit
 - sequencer: export and rename subject_length()
 (this branch uses cm/rebase-i and cm/rebase-i-updates.)

 "git commit --fixup=<commit>", which was to tweak the changes made
 to the contents while keeping the original log message intact,
 learned "--fixup=(amend|reword):<commit>", that can be used to
 tweak both the message and the contents, and only the message,
 respectively.

 + mailmap: do not respect symlinks for in-tree .mailmap
 + exclude: do not respect symlinks for in-tree .gitignore
 + attr: do not respect symlinks for in-tree .gitattributes
 + exclude: add flags parameter to add_patterns()
 + attr: convert "macro_ok" into a flags field
 + add open_nofollow() helper

 It does not make sense to make ".gitattributes", ".gitignore" and
 ".mailmap" symlinks, as they are supposed to be usable from the
 object store (think: bare repositories where HEAD:.mailmap etc. are
 used).  When these files are symbolic links, we used to read the
 contents of the files pointed by them by mistake, which has been
 corrected.

 Will cook in 'next'.

 "git repack" so far has been only capable of repacking everything
 under the sun into a single pack (or split by size).  A cleverer
 strategy to reduce the cost of repacking a repository has been
 introduced.

 "git fsck" and the corresponding check done during the transport
 learned to ensure that in-tree files like `.gitignore` and
 `.gitattributes` are not symbolic links.

 It seems that there are real projects with .gitignore recorded as
 symlinks, which may need to loosen the fsck setting.  Do we need to
 introduce a class that is separate from symlinked .gitmodules that
 has potential consequences that is more/less grave, so that these
 projects can opt out of the new checks?
