What's cooking in git.git (Aug 2015, #04; Tue, 25)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

[Graduated to "master"]

* cb/open-noatime-clear-errno (2015-08-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-08-17 at 6aa43a1)
 + git_open_noatime: return with errno=0 on success

 When trying to see that an object does not exist, a state errno
 leaked from our "first try to open a packfile with O_NOATIME and
 then if it fails retry without it" logic on a system that refuses
 O_NOATIME.  This confused us and caused us to die, saying that the
 packfile is unreadable, when we should have just reported that the
 object does not exist in that packfile to the caller.


* dt/notes-multiple (2015-08-11) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-08-12 at 0052055)
 + notes: handle multiple worktrees
 + worktrees: add find_shared_symref

 When linked worktree is used, simultaneous "notes merge" instances
 for the same ref in refs/notes/* are prevented from stomping on
 each other.


* dt/refs-pseudo (2015-08-11) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-08-12 at 7078eb6)
 + pseudoref: check return values from read_ref()
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-08-03 at 3eafd33)
 + sequencer: replace write_cherry_pick_head with update_ref
 + bisect: use update_ref
 + pseudorefs: create and use pseudoref update and delete functions
 + refs: add ref_type function
 + refs: introduce pseudoref and per-worktree ref concepts

 To prepare for allowing a different "ref" backend to be plugged in
 to the system, update_ref()/delete_ref() have been taught about
 ref-like things like MERGE_HEAD that are per-worktree (they will
 always be written to the filesystem inside $GIT_DIR).


* ee/clean-remove-dirs (2015-08-11) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-08-12 at fc41b09)
 + t7300-clean: require POSIXPERM for chmod 0 test

 Test updates for Windows.


* jc/finalize-temp-file (2015-08-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-08-12 at 6fe62fe)
 + sha1_file.c: rename move_temp_to_file() to finalize_object_file()

 Long overdue micro clean-up.


* jh/strbuf-read-use-read-in-full (2015-08-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-08-12 at db16247)
 + strbuf_read(): skip unnecessary strbuf_grow() at eof

 strbuf_read() used to have one extra iteration (and an unnecessary
 strbuf_grow() of 8kB), which was eliminated.


* jk/git-path (2015-08-10) 16 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-08-12 at 7ebe864)
 + memoize common git-path "constant" files
 + get_repo_path: refactor path-allocation
 + find_hook: keep our own static buffer
 + refs.c: remove_empty_directories can take a strbuf
 + refs.c: avoid git_path assignment in lock_ref_sha1_basic
 + refs.c: avoid repeated git_path calls in rename_tmp_log
 + refs.c: simplify strbufs in reflog setup and writing
 + path.c: drop git_path_submodule
 + refs.c: remove extra git_path calls from read_loose_refs
 + remote.c: drop extraneous local variable from migrate_file
 + prefer mkpathdup to mkpath in assignments
 + prefer git_pathdup to git_path in some possibly-dangerous cases
 + add_to_alternates_file: don't add duplicate entries
 + t5700: modernize style
 + cache.h: complete set of git_path_submodule helpers
 + cache.h: clarify documentation for git_path, et al
 (this branch is used by sb/submodule-helper.)

 git_path() and mkpath() are handy helper functions but it is easy
 to misuse, as the callers need to be careful to keep the number of
 active results below 4.  Their uses have been reduced.


* jk/guess-repo-name-regression-fix (2015-08-10) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-08-12 at 4cba33c)
 + clone: use computed length in guess_dir_name
 + clone: add tests for output directory
 (this branch is used by ps/guess-repo-name-at-root.)

 "git clone $URL" in recent releases of Git contains a regression in
 the code that invents a new repository name incorrectly based on
 the $URL.  This has been corrected.


* jk/long-error-messages (2015-08-11) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-08-12 at 36303cd)
 + vreportf: avoid intermediate buffer
 + vreportf: report to arbitrary filehandles

 The codepath to produce error messages had a hard-coded limit to
 the size of the message, primarily to avoid memory allocation while
 calling die().


* jk/negative-hiderefs (2015-08-07) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-08-12 at bdc478d)
 + refs: support negative transfer.hideRefs
 + docs/config.txt: reorder hideRefs config

 A negative !ref entry in multi-value transfer.hideRefs
 configuration can be used to say "don't hide this one".


* jk/test-with-x (2015-08-07) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-08-12 at 06576a1)
 + test-lib: disable trace when test is not verbose
 + test-lib: turn off "-x" tracing during chain-lint check

 Running tests with the "-x" option to make them verbose had some
 unpleasant interactions with other features of the test suite.


* mh/tempfile (2015-08-12) 16 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-08-12 at 80efcb7)
 + credential-cache--daemon: use tempfile module
 + credential-cache--daemon: delete socket from main()
 + gc: use tempfile module to handle gc.pid file
 + lock_repo_for_gc(): compute the path to "gc.pid" only once
 + diff: use tempfile module
 + setup_temporary_shallow(): use tempfile module
 + write_shared_index(): use tempfile module
 + register_tempfile(): new function to handle an existing temporary file
 + tempfile: add several functions for creating temporary files
 + prepare_tempfile_object(): new function, extracted from create_tempfile()
 + tempfile: a new module for handling temporary files
 + commit_lock_file(): use get_locked_file_path()
 + lockfile: add accessor get_lock_file_path()
 + lockfile: add accessors get_lock_file_fd() and get_lock_file_fp()
 + create_bundle(): duplicate file descriptor to avoid closing it twice
 + lockfile: move documentation to lockfile.h and lockfile.c

 The "lockfile" API has been rebuilt on top of a new "tempfile" API.


* mm/pull-upload-pack (2015-07-30) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-08-12 at 14d2a52)
 + pull.sh: quote $upload_pack when passing it to git-fetch

 "git pull" in recent releases of Git has a regression in the code
 that allows custom path to the --upload-pack=<program>.  This has
 been corrected.

 Note that this is irrelevant for 'master' with "git pull" rewritten
 in C.


* nd/dwim-wildcards-as-pathspecs (2015-08-11) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-08-12 at bb73f4d)
 + t2019: skip test requiring '*' in a file name non Windows

 Test updates for Windows.


* ps/guess-repo-name-at-root (2015-08-10) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-08-12 at 088860f)
 + clone: abort if no dir name could be guessed
 + clone: do not use port number as dir name
 + clone: do not include authentication data in guessed dir
 (this branch uses jk/guess-repo-name-regression-fix.)

 "git clone $URL", when cloning from a site whose sole purpose is to
 host a single repository (hence, no path after <scheme>://<site>/),
 tried to use the site name as the new repository name, but did not
 remove username or password when <site> part was of the form
 <user>@<pass>:<host>.  The code is taught to redact these.


* ps/t1509-chroot-test-fixup (2015-08-05) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-08-12 at 6d10ea5)
 + tests: fix cleanup after tests in t1509-root-worktree
 + tests: fix broken && chains in t1509-root-worktree

 t1509 test that requires a dedicated VM environment had some
 bitrot, which has been corrected.


* pt/am-builtin-options (2015-08-12) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-08-12 at e57f754)
 + am: let --signoff override --no-signoff
 + am: let command-line options override saved options
 + test_terminal: redirect child process' stdin to a pty
 (this branch is used by jc/am-state-fix.)

 After "git am --opt1" stops, running "git am --opt2" pays attention
 to "--opt2" only for the patch that caused the original invocation
 to stop.


* sb/check-return-from-read-ref (2015-08-03) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-08-12 at 4a1c801)
 + transport-helper: die on errors reading refs.


* tb/complete-rebase-i-edit-todo (2015-08-05) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-08-12 at 9606c21)
 + completion: offer '--edit-todo' during interactive rebase

 The command-line completion script (in contrib/) has been updated.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* dt/untracked-sparse (2015-08-19) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-08-25 at 2501a7e)
 + t7063: use --force-untracked-cache to speed up a bit
 (this branch is used by dt/untracked-subdir.)

 Test update.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* as/docfix-reflog-expire-unreachable (2015-08-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-08-25 at eb75d55)
 + Documentation/config: fix inconsistent label on gc.*.reflogExpireUnreachable

 Will merge to 'master'.


* cc/trailers-corner-case-fix (2015-08-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-08-25 at ac25d80)
 + trailer: ignore first line of message

 "interpret-trailers" helper mistook a single-liner log message that
 has a colon as the end of existing trailer.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/am-state-fix (2015-08-25) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-08-25 at 4efcd88)
 + write_file(): drop caller-supplied LF from calls to create a one-liner file
 + write_file_v(): do not leave incomplete line at the end
 + write_file(): drop "fatal" parameter
 + builtin/am: make sure state files are text
 + builtin/am: introduce write_state_*() helper functions

 Recent reimplementation of "git am" changed the format of state
 files kept in $GIT_DIR/rebase-apply/ without meaning to do so,
 primarily because write_file() API was cumbersome to use and it was
 easy to mistakenly make text files with incomplete lines.  Update
 write_file() interface to make it harder to misuse.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/calloc-pathspec (2015-08-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-08-25 at 877490c)
 + ps_matched: xcalloc() takes nmemb and then element size

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/log-p-cc (2015-08-25) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-08-25 at 2d6a6d4)
 + builtin/log.c: minor reformat
 + log: show merge commit when --cc is given
 + log: when --cc is given, default to -p unless told otherwise
 + log: rename "tweak" helpers

 "git log --cc" did not show any patch, even though most of the time
 the user meant "git log --cc -p -m" to see patch output for commits
 with a single parent, and combined diff for merge commits.  The
 command is taught to DWIM "--cc" (without "--raw" and other forms
 of output specification) to "--cc -p -m".

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/fix-alias-pager-config-key-warnings (2015-08-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-08-25 at 89eac5a)
 + config: silence warnings for command names with invalid keys

 Because the configuration system does not allow "alias.0foo" and
 "pager.0foo" as the configuration key, the user cannot use '0foo'
 as a custom command name anyway, but "git 0foo" tried to look these
 keys up and emitted useless warnings before saying '0foo is not a
 git command'.  These warning messages have been squelched.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/rev-list-has-no-notes (2015-08-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-08-25 at 73cb2ad)
 + rev-list: make it obvious that we do not support notes

 "git rev-list" does not take "--notes" option, but did not complain
 when one is given.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* kn/for-each-tag (2015-08-25) 15 commits
 - SQUASH??? a tag longer than 15 bytes break alignment but keeps SP before the message
 - tag.c: implement '--merged' and '--no-merged' options
 - tag.c: implement '--format' option
 - tag.c: use 'ref-filter' APIs
 - tag.c: use 'ref-filter' data structures
 - ref-filter: add option to match literal pattern
 - ref-filter: add support to sort by version
 - ref-filter: support printing N lines from tag annotation
 - ref-filter: add option to filter out tags, branches and remotes
 - ref-filter: implement an `align` atom
 - utf8: add function to align a string into given strbuf
 - ref-filter: introduce ref_formatting_state and ref_formatting_stack
 - ref-filter: move `struct atom_value` to ref-filter.c
 - Merge 'jk/git-path' into kn/for-each-tag
 - Merge 'kn/for-each-tag-branch' into kn/for-each-tag
 (this branch uses kn/for-each-tag-branch.)

 The "ref-filter" code was taught about many parts of what "tag -l"
 does and then "tag -l" is reimplemented in terms of "ref-filter".

 Almost there...


* nd/fixup-linked-gitdir (2015-08-25) 1 commit
 - setup: update the right file in multiple checkouts

 The code in "multiple-worktree" support that attempted to recover
 from an inconsistent state updated an incorrect file.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* nd/ita-cleanup (2015-08-25) 6 commits
 - grep: make it clear i-t-a entries are ignored
 - checkout(-index): do not checkout i-t-a entries
 - apply: make sure check_preimage() does not leave empty file on error
 - apply: fix adding new files on i-t-a entries
 - Add and use convenient macro ce_intent_to_add()
 - blame: remove obsolete comment

 Paths that have been told the index about with "add -N" are not yet
 in the index, but various commands behaved as if they already are.

 Some commits need better explanation.

 Waiting for a reroll.


* sg/describe-contains (2015-08-25) 1 commit
 - describe --contains: default to HEAD when no commit-ish is given

 "git describe" without argument defaulted to describe the HEAD
 commit, but "git describe --contains" didn't.  Arguably, in a
 repository used for active development, such defaulting would not
 be very useful as the tip of branch is typically not tagged, but it
 is better to be consistent.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sg/help-group (2015-08-25) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-08-25 at 907e5a8)
 + generate-cmdlist: re-implement as shell script

 We rewrote one of the build scripts in Perl but this reimplements
 in Bourne shell.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* sg/t3020-typofix (2015-08-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-08-25 at 051d6c0)
 + t3020: fix typo in test description

 Will merge to 'master'.


* sg/wt-status-header-inclusion (2015-08-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-08-25 at fa5b2b2)
 + wt-status: move #include "pathspec.h" to the header

 Will merge to 'master'.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* sb/remove-get-pathspec (2015-08-03) 1 commit
 - builtin/mv: remove get_pathspec()

 Will discard.
 ($gmane/276104)


* mk/submodule-gitdir-path (2015-08-05) 2 commits
 - path: implement common_dir handling in git_path_submodule()
 - submodule refactor: use git_path_submodule() in add_submodule_odb()

 The submodule code has been taught to work better with separate
 work trees created via "git worktree add".

 Waiting for a review.
 ($gmane/275340).


* nd/list-files (2015-02-09) 21 commits
 - t3080: tests for git-list-files
 - list-files: -M aka diff-cached
 - list-files -F: show submodules with the new indicator '&'
 - list-files: add -F/--classify
 - list-files: show directories as well as files
 - list-files: do not show duplicate cached entries
 - list-files: sort output and remove duplicates
 - list-files: add -t back
 - list-files: add -1 short for --no-column
 - list-files: add -R/--recursive short for --max-depth=-1
 - list-files: -u does not imply showing stages
 - list-files: make alias 'ls' default to 'list-files'
 - list-files: a user friendly version of ls-files and more
 - ls-files: support --max-depth
 - ls-files: add --column
 - ls-files: add --color to highlight file names
 - ls-files: buffer full item in strbuf before printing
 - ls_colors.c: highlight submodules like directories
 - ls_colors.c: add a function to color a file name
 - ls_colors.c: parse color.ls.* from config file
 - ls_colors.c: add $LS_COLORS parsing code

 A new "git list-files" Porcelain command, "ls-files" with bells and
 whistles.

 Reroll to base on wt-status work ($gmane/265142) has seen some
 positive discussions.

 Waiting for a further polished reroll ($gmane/265534).


* mh/numparse (2015-03-19) 14 commits
 . diff_opt_parse(): use convert_i() when handling --abbrev=<num>
 . diff_opt_parse(): use convert_i() when handling "-l<num>"
 . opt_arg(): simplify pointer handling
 . opt_arg(): report errors parsing option values
 . opt_arg(): use convert_i() in implementation
 . opt_arg(): val is always non-NULL
 . builtin_diff(): detect errors when parsing --unified argument
 . handle_revision_opt(): use convert_ui() when handling "--abbrev="
 . strtoul_ui(), strtol_i(): remove functions
 . handle_revision_opt(): use convert_i() when handling "-<digit>"
 . handle_revision_opt(): use skip_prefix() in many places
 . write_subdirectory(): use convert_ui() for parsing mode
 . cacheinfo_callback(): use convert_ui() when handling "--cacheinfo"
 . numparse: new module for parsing integral numbers

 Many codepaths use unchecked use of strtol() and friends (or even
 worse, atoi()).  Introduce a set of wrappers that try to be more
 careful.

 Expecting a reroll.
 ($gmane/268058).


* kk/log-merges-config (2015-04-21) 5 commits
 - bash-completion: add support for git-log --merges= and log.merges
 - t4202-log: add tests for --merges=
 - Documentation: add git-log --merges= option and log.merges config. var
 - log: honor log.merges= option
 - revision: add --merges={show|only|hide} option

 "git log" (but not other commands in the "log" family) learned to
 pay attention to the log.merges configuration variable that can be
 set to "show" (the normal behaviour), "only" (hide non-merge
 commits), or "hide" (hide merge commits).  --merges=(show|only|hide)
 can be used to override the setting from the command line.

 The documentation may need to be updated once more ($gmane/267250).
 Waiting for a reroll.


* mg/httpd-tests-update-for-apache-2.4 (2015-04-08) 2 commits
 - t/lib-git-svn: check same httpd module dirs as lib-httpd
 - t/lib-httpd: load mod_unixd

 This is the first two commits in a three-patch series $gmane/266962

 Expecting a reroll.
 with updated log message ($gmane/268061).


* bw/portability-solaris (2015-07-20) 3 commits
 - tests: fix sed usage in tests to work around broken xpg4/sed on Solaris
 - tests: fix sed usage in tests to work around broken xpg4/sed on Solaris
 - tests: modify tr expressions so that xpg4/tr handles it on Solaris

 Needs another reroll?
 ($gmane/274296)


* jc/clone-bundle (2015-04-30) 1 commit
 - repack: optionally create a clone.bundle

 Waiting for further work.
 Still an early WIP.


* mg/index-read-error-messages (2015-06-01) 2 commits
 - messages: uniform error messages for index write
 - show-index: uniform error messages for index read

 The tip was RFC.
 Expecting a reroll.


* jk/log-missing-default-HEAD (2015-06-03) 1 commit
 - log: diagnose empty HEAD more clearly

 "git init empty && git -C empty log" said "bad default revision 'HEAD'",
 which was found to be a bit confusing to new users.

 What's the status of this one?


* wp/sha1-name-negative-match (2015-06-08) 2 commits
 - sha1_name.c: introduce '^{/!-<negative pattern>}' notation
 - test for '!' handling in rev-parse's named commits

 Introduce "branch^{/!-<pattern>}" notation to name a commit
 reachable from branch that does not match the given pattern.

 Expecting a reroll.


* mk/utf8-no-iconv-warn (2015-06-08) 1 commit
 - utf8.c: print warning about disabled iconv

 Warn when a reencoding is requested in a build without iconv
 support, as the end user is likely to get an unexpected result.  I
 think the same level of safety should be added to a build with
 iconv support when the specified encoding is not available, but the
 patch does not go there.

 Expecting a reroll.


* ak/format-patch-odir-config (2015-06-19) 1 commit
 - format-patch: introduce format.outputDirectory configuration

 Reroll exists but didn't pick it up as it seemed to be still
 collecting review comments.

 Expecting a reroll.
 ($gmane/272180).


* ad/bisect-terms (2015-08-03) 4 commits
 - bisect: allow setting any user-specified in 'git bisect start'
 - bisect: add 'git bisect terms' to view the current terms
 - bisect: add the terms old/new
 - bisect: sanity check on terms

 The use of 'good/bad' in "git bisect" made it confusing to use when
 hunting for a state change that is not a regression (e.g. bugfix).
 The command learned 'old/new' and then allows the end user to
 say e.g. "bisect start --term-old=fast --term=new=slow" to find a
 performance regression.

 Michael's idea to make 'good/bad' more intelligent does have
 certain attractiveness ($gname/272867), and makes some of the work
 on this topic a moot point.

 Will hold.


* mh/notes-allow-reading-treeish (2015-07-13) 1 commit
 - notes: allow treeish expressions as notes ref

 Some "git notes" operations, e.g. "git log --notes=<note>", should
 be able to read notes from any tree-ish that is shaped like a notes
 tree, but the notes infrastructure required that the argument must
 be a ref under refs/notes/.  Loosen it to require a valid ref only
 when the operation would update the notes (in which case we must
 have a place to store the updated notes tree, iow, a ref).

 Needs update to docs.
 ($gmane/273928)


* jc/diff-b-m (2015-02-23) 5 commits
 . WIPWIP
 . WIP: diff-b-m
 - diffcore-rename: allow easier debugging
 - diffcore-rename.c: add locate_rename_src()
 - diffcore-break: allow debugging

 "git diff -B -M" produced incorrect patch when the postimage of a
 completely rewritten file is similar to the preimage of a removed
 file; such a resulting file must not be expressed as a rename from
 other place.

 The fix in this patch is broken, unfortunately.


* pw/remote-set-url-fetch (2014-11-26) 1 commit
 . remote: add --fetch and --both options to set-url

 Ejected.


* tr/remerge-diff (2014-11-10) 9 commits
 . t4213: avoid "|" in sed regexp
 . log --remerge-diff: show what the conflict resolution changed
 . name-hash: allow dir hashing even when !ignore_case
 . merge-recursive: allow storing conflict hunks in index
 . merge_diff_mode: fold all merge diff variants into an enum
 . combine-diff: do not pass revs->dense_combined_merges redundantly
 . merge-recursive: -Xindex-only to leave worktree unchanged
 . merge-recursive: internal flag to avoid touching the worktree
 . merge-recursive: remove dead conditional in update_stages()

 "log -p" output learns a new way to let users inspect a merge
 commit by showing the differences between the automerged result
 with conflicts the person who recorded the merge would have seen
 and the final conflict resolution that was recorded in the merge.

 Waiting for a reroll.
 ($gmane/256591).


* tg/perf-lib-test-perf-cleanup (2013-09-19) 2 commits
 - perf-lib: add test_perf_cleanup target
 - perf-lib: split starting the test from the execution

 Add test_perf_cleanup shell function to the perf suite, that allows
 the script writers to define a test with a clean-up action.

 Will hold.


* jc/show-branch (2014-03-24) 5 commits
 - show-branch: use commit slab to represent bitflags of arbitrary width
 - show-branch.c: remove "all_mask"
 - show-branch.c: abstract out "flags" operation
 - show-branch.c: lift all_mask/all_revs to a global static
 - show-branch.c: update comment style

 Waiting for the final step to lift the hard-limit.

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* db/push-sign-if-asked (2015-08-19) 9 commits
 - push: add a config option push.gpgSign for default signed pushes
 - push: support signing pushes iff the server supports it
 - builtin/send-pack.c: use parse_options API
 - config.c: rename git_config_maybe_bool_text and export it as git_parse_maybe_bool
 - transport: remove git_transport_options.push_cert
 - gitremote-helpers.txt: document pushcert option
 - Documentation/git-send-pack.txt: document --signed
 - Documentation/git-send-pack.txt: wrap long synopsis line
 - Documentation/git-push.txt: document when --signed may fail

 The client side codepaths in "git push" have been cleaned up
 and the user can request to perform an optional "signed push",
 i.e. sign only when the other end accepts signed push.

 I think this is ready for 'next', but did I miss comments that need
 to be addressed before it happens?


* dk/gc-idx-wo-pack (2015-08-17) 3 commits
 - DONTMERGE: log message, grace-period and tests $gmane/276058
 - gc: remove stale .idx files without corresponding .pack file
 - prepare_packed_git(): refactor garbage reporting in pack directory

 Having a leftover .idx file without correspoinding .pack file in
 the repository hurts performance; "git gc" learned to prune them.

 Expecting a reroll.


* ep/http-configure-ssl-version (2015-08-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-08-19 at aab726b)
 + http: add support for specifying the SSL version

 A new configuration variable http.sslVersion can be used to specify
 what specific version of SSL/TLS to use to make a connection.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jv/send-email-selective-smtp-auth (2015-08-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-08-19 at 3f0c693)
 + send-email: provide whitelist of SMTP AUTH mechanisms

 "git send-email" learned a new option --smtp-auth to limit the SMTP
 AUTH mechanisms to be used to a subset of what the system library
 supports.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* po/po-readme (2015-08-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-08-19 at 1899e59)
 + po/README: Update directions for l10n contributors

 Will merge to 'master'.


* pt/am-builtin-abort-fix (2015-08-19) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-08-19 at 729e682)
 + am --skip/--abort: merge HEAD/ORIG_HEAD tree into index

 "git am" that was recently reimplemented in C had a performance
 regression in "git am --abort" that goes back to the version before
 an attempted (and failed) patch application.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ss/fix-config-fd-leak (2015-08-14) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-08-19 at 80d4880)
 + config: close config file handle in case of error

 Will merge to 'master'.


* bb/remote-get-url (2015-08-05) 1 commit
 - remote: add get-url subcommand

 "git remote" learned "get-url" subcommand to show the URL for a
 given remote name used for fetching and pushing.

 Waiting for a reroll.
 ($gmane/275401)


* jk/notes-merge-config (2015-08-17) 6 commits
 - notes: teach git-notes about notes.<name>.mergeStrategy option
 - notes: add notes.mergeStrategy option to select default strategy
 - notes: add tests for --commit/--abort/--strategy exclusivity
 - notes: extract parse_notes_merge_strategy to notes-utils
 - notes: extract enum notes_merge_strategy to notes-utils.h
 - notes: document cat_sort_uniq rewriteMode

 "git notes merge" can be told with "--strategy=<how>" option how to
 automatically handle conflicts; this can now be configured by
 setting notes.merge configuration variable.

 I think this is ready for 'next', but did I miss comments that need
 to be addressed before it happens?


* hv/submodule-config (2015-08-19) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-08-25 at 82adb30)
 + submodule: allow erroneous values for the fetchRecurseSubmodules option
 + submodule: use new config API for worktree configurations
 + submodule: extract functions for config set and lookup
 + submodule: implement a config API for lookup of .gitmodules values
 (this branch is used by sb/submodule-helper.)

 The gitmodules API accessed from the C code learned to cache stuff
 lazily.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* sb/submodule-helper (2015-08-25) 7 commits
 - submodule: helper to run foreach in parallel
 - thread-utils: add a threaded task queue
 - FIXUP submodule: implement `module_clone` as a builtin helper
 - submodule: implement `module_clone` as a builtin helper
 - submodule: implement `module_name` as a builtin helper
 - submodule: implement `module_list` as a builtin helper
 - Merge 'hv/submodule-config' to 'sb/submodule-helper'
 (this branch uses hv/submodule-config.)

 The infrastructure to rewrite "git submodule" in C is being built
 incrementally.  These early part looks promising.


* dt/untracked-subdir (2015-08-19) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-08-25 at ab4fd04)
 + untracked cache: fix entry invalidation
 + untracked-cache: fix subdirectory handling
 (this branch uses dt/untracked-sparse.)

 The experimental untracked-cache feature were buggy when paths with
 a few levels of subdirectories are involved.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ad/cygwin-wants-rename (2015-08-07) 1 commit
 - config.mak.uname: Cygwin needs OBJECT_CREATION_USES_RENAMES

 Will hold.
 ($gmane/275680).


* sg/config-name-only (2015-08-20) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-08-25 at 6cb3b7d)
 + get_urlmatch: avoid useless strbuf write
 + format_config: simplify buffer handling
 + format_config: don't init strbuf
 + config: restructure format_config() for better control flow
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-08-12 at c658fe4)
 + completion: list variable names reliably with 'git config --name-only'
 + config: add '--name-only' option to list only variable names

 "git config --list" output was hard to parse when values consist of
 multiple lines.  "--name-only" option is added to help this.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* kn/for-each-tag-branch (2015-08-03) 11 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-08-03 at d9e94b9)
 + for-each-ref: add '--contains' option
 + ref-filter: implement '--contains' option
 + parse-options.h: add macros for '--contains' option
 + parse-option: rename parse_opt_with_commit()
 + for-each-ref: add '--merged' and '--no-merged' options
 + ref-filter: implement '--merged' and '--no-merged' options
 + ref-filter: add parse_opt_merge_filter()
 + for-each-ref: add '--points-at' option
 + ref-filter: implement '--points-at' option
 + tag: libify parse_opt_points_at()
 + t6302: for-each-ref tests for ref-filter APIs
 (this branch is used by kn/for-each-tag.)

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2015-07-15

 Some features from "git tag -l" and "git branch -l" have been made
 available to "git for-each-ref" so that eventually the unified
 implementation can be shared across all three, in a follow-up
 series or two.

 (this branch is used by jc/rerere-multi.)

 Code clean-up and minor fixes (so far).

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jc/rerere-multi (2015-07-30) 7 commits
 . t4200: rerere a merge with two identical conflicts
 . WIP
 . rerere: allow multiple variants to exist
 - rerere: delay the recording of preimage
 - rerere: handle leftover rr-cache/$ID directory and postimage files
 - rerere: scan $GIT_DIR/rr-cache/$ID when instantiating a rerere_id
 - rerere: split conflict ID further
 (this branch uses jc/rerere.)

 "git rerere" can encounter two or more files with the same conflict
 signature that have to be resolved in different ways, but there was
 no way to record these separate resolutions.


* jc/merge-drop-old-syntax (2015-04-29) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-08-03 at a52c2b2)
 + merge: drop 'git merge <message> HEAD <commit>' syntax

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2015-05-28

 Stop supporting "git merge <message> HEAD <commit>" syntax that
 has been deprecated since October 2007.

 Will keep in 'next' during the 2.6 cycle.
