What's cooking in git.git (May 2018, #03; Wed, 23)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* ab/perl-python-attrs (2018-04-27) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-08 at b440e9bbb9)
 + .gitattributes: add a diff driver for Python
 + .gitattributes: use the "perl" differ for Perl
 + .gitattributes: add *.pl extension for Perl

 We learned that our source files with ".pl" and ".py" extensions
 are Perl and Python files respectively and changes to them are
 better viewed as such with appropriate diff drivers.


* ah/misc-doc-updates (2018-05-06) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-16 at e2e3b68a66)
 + doc: normalize [--options] to [options] in git-diff
 + doc: add note about shell quoting to revision.txt
 + git-svn: remove ''--add-author-from' for 'commit-diff'
 + doc: add '-d' and '-o' for 'git push'
 + doc: clarify ignore rules for git ls-files
 + doc: align 'diff --no-index' in text and synopsis
 + doc: improve formatting in githooks.txt

 Misc doc fixes.


* ao/config-api-doc (2018-05-11) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-22 at a17d6dda92)
 + doc: fix config API documentation about config_with_options

 Doc update.


* bc/asciidoctor-tab-width (2018-05-07) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-16 at be2a42c473)
 + Documentation: render revisions correctly under Asciidoctor
 + Documentation: use 8-space tabs with Asciidoctor

 Asciidoctor gives a reasonable imitation for AsciiDoc, but does not
 render illustration in a literal block correctly when indented with
 HT by default. The problem is fixed by forcing 8-space tabs.


* bc/format-patch-cover-no-attach (2018-05-02) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-16 at fa1ffeb3fe)
 + format-patch: make cover letters always text/plain

 "git format-patch --cover --attach" created a broken MIME multipart
 message for the cover letter, which has been fixed by keeping the
 cover letter as plain text file.


* bc/mailmap-self (2018-05-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-16 at a009c64bd2)
 + mailmap: update brian m. carlson's email address


* bp/test-drop-caches (2018-05-04) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-16 at 0e40ab2408)
 + test-drop-caches: simplify delay loading of NtSetSystemInformation

 Code simplification.


* bw/server-options (2018-04-24) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-08 at a18ce56f3c)
 + fetch: send server options when using protocol v2
 + ls-remote: send server options when using protocol v2
 + serve: introduce the server-option capability
 + Merge branch 'bw/protocol-v2' into HEAD

 The transport protocol v2 is getting updated further.


* cc/perf-aggregate-unknown-option (2018-04-26) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-08 at db7d2870f8)
 + perf/aggregate: use Getopt::Long for option parsing

 Perf-test helper updates.


* cc/perf-bisect (2018-05-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-16 at 5a078a2fdf)
 + perf/bisect_run_script: disable codespeed

 Performance test updates.


* ds/lazy-load-trees (2018-05-02) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-02 at d54016d9e3)
 + coccinelle: avoid wrong transformation suggestions from commit.cocci
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-25 at b90813f421)
 + commit-graph: lazy-load trees for commits
 + treewide: replace maybe_tree with accessor methods
 + commit: create get_commit_tree() method
 + treewide: rename tree to maybe_tree
 + Merge branch 'bw/c-plus-plus' into ds/lazy-load-trees
 (this branch is used by ds/commit-graph-lockfile-fix and ds/generation-numbers.)

 The code has been taught to use the duplicated information stored
 in the commit-graph file to learn the tree object name for a commit
 to avoid opening and parsing the commit object when it makes sense
 to do so.


* em/status-rename-config (2018-05-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-16 at 33c1cc093c)
 + wt-status: use settings from git_diff_ui_config
 (this branch is used by bp/status-rename-config.)

 "git status" learned to pay attention to UI related diff
 configuration variables such as diff.renames.


* en/git-debugger (2018-04-25) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-08 at 73369cd1e5)
 + Make running git under other debugger-like programs easy

 Dev support.

 + merge-recursive: make !o->detect_rename codepath more obvious
 + merge-recursive: fix leaks of allocated renames and diff_filepairs
 + merge-recursive: introduce new functions to handle rename logic
 + merge-recursive: move the get_renames() function
 + directory rename detection: tests for handling overwriting dirty files
 + directory rename detection: tests for handling overwriting untracked files
 + directory rename detection: miscellaneous testcases to complete coverage
 + directory rename detection: testcases exploring possibly suboptimal merges
 + directory rename detection: more involved edge/corner testcases
 + directory rename detection: testcases checking which side did the rename
 + directory rename detection: files/directories in the way of some renames
 + directory rename detection: partially renamed directory testcase/discussion
 + directory rename detection: testcases to avoid taking detection too far
 + directory rename detection: directory splitting testcases
 + directory rename detection: basic testcases
 (this branch is used by bp/merge-rename-config and ma/unpack-trees-free-msgs.)

 Rename detection logic in "diff" family that is used in "merge" has
 learned to guess when all of x/a, x/b and x/c have moved to z/a,
 z/b and z/c, it is likely that x/d added in the meantime would also
 want to move to z/d by taking the hint that the entire directory
 'x' moved to 'z'.  A bug causing dirty files involved in a rename
 to be overwritten during merge has also been fixed as part of this
 work.  Incidentally, this also avoids updating a file in the
 working tree after a (non-trivial) merge whose result matches what
 our side originally had.


* en/unpack-trees-split-index-fix (2018-05-02) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-16 at 1adff065b2)
 + unpack_trees: fix breakage when o->src_index != o->dst_index

 The split-index feature had a long-standing and dormant bug in
 certain use of the in-core merge machinery, which has been fixed.
 cf. <CACsJy8CeDhrT9GXe9q5gqsAeq_sSQ8jyF2nMOFxzjwKtE31oPQ@mail.gmail.com>


* fg/completion-external (2018-05-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-16 at 5d83f92caf)
 + completion: load completion file for external subcommand

 The command line completion mechanism (in contrib/) learned to load
 custom completion file for "git $command" where $command is a
 custom "git-$command" that the end user has on the $PATH when using
 newer version of bash.
 cf. <CAM0VKjkTu+OkLM3gvX73mWugxArCVmqRBmWGHiKuLiLRNkkNow@mail.gmail.com>


* hn/sort-ls-remote (2018-05-14) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-16 at 64336850f2)
 + t5512: run git fetch inside test

 Hotfix.


* jk/apply-p-doc (2018-05-11) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-22 at 48f280346b)
 + apply: clarify "-p" documentation

 Doc update.


* js/deprecate-grafts (2018-04-30) 12 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-08 at 1d7b31d179)
 + Remove obsolete script to convert grafts to replace refs
 + technical/shallow: describe why shallow cannot use replace refs
 + technical/shallow: stop referring to grafts
 + filter-branch: stop suggesting to use grafts
 + Deprecate support for .git/info/grafts
 + Add a test for `git replace --convert-graft-file`
 + replace: introduce --convert-graft-file
 + replace: prepare create_graft() for converting graft files wholesale
 + replace: "libify" create_graft() and callees
 + replace: avoid using die() to indicate a bug
 + commit: Let the callback of for_each_mergetag return on error
 + argv_array: offer to split a string by whitespace

 The functionality of "$GIT_DIR/info/grafts" has been superseded by
 the "refs/replace/" mechanism for some time now, but the internal
 code had support for it in many places, which has been cleaned up
 in order to drop support of the "grafts" mechanism.


* js/no-pager-shorthand (2018-05-04) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-08 at 10e6031dd1)
 + git: add -P as a short option for --no-pager

 "git --no-pager cmd" did not have short-and-sweet single letter
 option. Now it does.


* js/rebase-i-clean-msg-after-fixup-continue (2018-05-02) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-08 at 7e684c153d)
 + rebase --skip: clean up commit message after a failed fixup/squash
 + sequencer: always commit without editing when asked for
 + rebase -i: Handle "combination of <n> commits" with GETTEXT_POISON
 + rebase -i: demonstrate bugs with fixup!/squash! commit messages

 "git rebase -i" sometimes left intermediate "# This is a
 combination of N commits" message meant for the human consumption
 inside an editor in the final result in certain corner cases, which
 has been fixed.


* js/rebase-recreate-merge (2018-04-26) 17 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-16 at f1aeea2879)
 + rebase -i --rebase-merges: add a section to the man page
 + rebase -i: introduce --rebase-merges=[no-]rebase-cousins
 + pull: accept --rebase=merges to recreate the branch topology
 + rebase --rebase-merges: avoid "empty merges"
 + sequencer: handle post-rewrite for merge commands
 + sequencer: make refs generated by the `label` command worktree-local
 + rebase --rebase-merges: add test for --keep-empty
 + rebase: introduce the --rebase-merges option
 + rebase-helper --make-script: introduce a flag to rebase merges
 + sequencer: fast-forward `merge` commands, if possible
 + sequencer: introduce the `merge` command
 + sequencer: introduce new commands to reset the revision
 + git-rebase--interactive: clarify arguments
 + sequencer: offer helpful advice when a command was rescheduled
 + sequencer: refactor how original todo list lines are accessed
 + sequencer: make rearrange_squash() a bit more obvious
 + sequencer: avoid using errno clobbered by rollback_lock_file()
 (this branch is used by js/sequencer-and-root-commits.)

 "git rebase" learned "--rebase-merges" to transplant the whole
 topology of commit graph elsewhere.


* js/test-unset-prereq (2018-04-30) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-08 at 3aecbf25a3)
 + tests: introduce test_unset_prereq, for debugging

 Test debugging aid.
 cf. <20180507115950.3887-1-szeder.dev@gmail.com>


* nd/completion-aliasfiletype-typofix (2018-05-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-16 at 045e4ac190)
 + completion: fix misspelled config key aliasesfiletype

 Typofix.


* nd/doc-header (2018-05-02) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-16 at 0599eb3ec9)
 + doc: keep first level section header in upper case

 Doc formatting fix.


* nd/pack-format-doc (2018-05-13) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-22 at ff2c48f356)
 + pack-format.txt: more details on pack file format

 Doc update.


* nd/pack-objects-pack-struct (2018-04-16) 15 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-16 at 171459475d)
 + ci: exercise the whole test suite with uncommon code in pack-objects
 + pack-objects: reorder members to shrink struct object_entry
 + pack-objects: shrink delta_size field in struct object_entry
 + pack-objects: shrink size field in struct object_entry
 + pack-objects: clarify the use of object_entry::size
 + pack-objects: don't check size when the object is bad
 + pack-objects: shrink z_delta_size field in struct object_entry
 + pack-objects: refer to delta objects by index instead of pointer
 + pack-objects: move in_pack out of struct object_entry
 + pack-objects: move in_pack_pos out of struct object_entry
 + pack-objects: use bitfield for object_entry::depth
 + pack-objects: use bitfield for object_entry::dfs_state
 + pack-objects: turn type and in_pack_type to bitfields
 + pack-objects: a bit of document about struct object_entry
 + read-cache.c: make $GIT_TEST_SPLIT_INDEX boolean

 "git pack-objects" needs to allocate tons of "struct object_entry"
 while doing its work, and shrinking its size helps the performance
 quite a bit.

* nd/pack-unreachable-objects-doc (2018-05-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-16 at c4bf977564)
 + pack-objects: validation and documentation about unreachable options

 Doc update.


* nd/repack-keep-pack (2018-04-16) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-08 at ab906be358)
 + pack-objects: show some progress when counting kept objects
 + gc --auto: exclude base pack if not enough mem to "repack -ad"
 + gc: handle a corner case in gc.bigPackThreshold
 + gc: add gc.bigPackThreshold config
 + gc: add --keep-largest-pack option
 + repack: add --keep-pack option
 + t7700: have closing quote of a test at the beginning of line

 "git gc" in a large repository takes a lot of time as it considers
 to repack all objects into one pack by default.  The command has
 been taught to pretend as if the largest existing packfile is
 marked with ".keep" so that it is left untouched while objects in
 other packs and loose ones are repacked.
 cf. <CACsJy8CuVRy4UPEwXJJYAjePEz5zjKMLhRjh9UFw0DPYTzobkw@mail.gmail.com>


* nd/term-columns (2018-05-13) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-22 at e50b727a48)
 + column: fix off-by-one default width
 + pager: set COLUMNS to term_columns()

 The code did not propagate the terminal width to subprocesses via
 COLUMNS environment variable, which it now does.  This caused
 trouble to "git column" helper subprocess when "git tag --column=row"
 tried to list the existing tags on a display with non-default width.


* sb/object-store-replace (2018-05-21) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-21 at 4fb28f7b16)
 + get_main_ref_store: BUG() when outside a repository
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-18 at c95db04db9)
 + object.c: clear replace map before freeing it
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-16 at 41bbedcc81)
 + replace-object.c: remove the_repository from prepare_replace_object
 + object.c: free replace map in raw_object_store_clear

 Hotfix.


* sb/oid-object-info (2018-04-26) 9 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-08 at f3c08f298e)
 + cache.h: allow oid_object_info to handle arbitrary repositories
 + packfile: add repository argument to cache_or_unpack_entry
 + packfile: add repository argument to unpack_entry
 + packfile: add repository argument to read_object
 + packfile: add repository argument to packed_object_info
 + packfile: add repository argument to packed_to_object_type
 + packfile: add repository argument to retry_bad_packed_offset
 + cache.h: add repository argument to oid_object_info
 + cache.h: add repository argument to oid_object_info_extended
 (this branch is used by sb/object-store-alloc and sb/object-store-grafts.)

 The codepath around object-info API has been taught to take the
 repository object (which in turn tells the API which object store
 the objects are to be located).


* sg/t5310-jgit-bitmap-test (2018-05-11) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-22 at ef0d86084d)
 + t5310-pack-bitmaps: make JGit tests work with GIT_TEST_SPLIT_INDEX

 Test update.


* sg/t5516-fixes (2018-05-11) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-22 at 254fa59e3a)
 + t5516-fetch-push: fix broken &&-chain
 + t5516-fetch-push: fix 'push with dry-run' test

 Test fixes.


* sg/t7005-spaces-in-filenames-cleanup (2018-05-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-22 at 0bc626c61a)
 + t7005-editor: get rid of the SPACES_IN_FILENAMES prereq

 Test update.


* tb/test-apfs-utf8-normalization (2018-05-02) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-16 at feabe72b42)
 + test: correct detection of UTF8_NFD_TO_NFC for APFS

 A test to see if the filesystem normalizes UTF-8 filename has been
 updated to check what we need to know in a more direct way, i.e. a
 path created in NFC form can be accessed with NFD form (or vice
 versa) to cope with APFS as well as HFS.


* tg/worktree-add-existing-branch (2018-04-30) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-08 at 8b76505192)
 + worktree: teach "add" to check out existing branches
 + worktree: factor out dwim_branch function
 + worktree: improve message when creating a new worktree
 + worktree: remove extra members from struct add_opts

 "git worktree add" learned to check out an existing branch.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* bw/ref-prefix-for-configured-refspec (2018-05-18) 2 commits
 - fetch: generate ref-prefixes when using a configured refspec
 - refspec: consolidate ref-prefix generation logic
 (this branch uses bw/refspec-api.)

 "git fetch $there $refspec" that talks over protocol v2 can take
 advantage of server-side ref filtering; the code has been extended
 so that this mechanism triggers also when fetching with configured
 refspec.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/config-blob-sans-repo (2018-05-21) 1 commit
 - config: die when --blob is used outside a repository

 Error codepath fix.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/snprintf-truncation (2018-05-21) 5 commits
 - fmt_with_err: add a comment that truncation is OK
 - shorten_unambiguous_ref: use xsnprintf
 - fsmonitor: use internal argv_array of struct child_process
 - log_write_email_headers: use strbufs
 - http: use strbufs instead of fixed buffers

 Avoid unchecked snprintf() to make future code auditing easier.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* js/empty-config-section-fix (2018-05-18) 1 commit
 - config: a user-provided invalid section is not a BUG

 Error codepath fix.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ma/config-store-data-clear (2018-05-21) 3 commits
 - config: let `config_store_data_clear()` handle `key`
 - config: let `config_store_data_clear()` handle `value_regex`
 - config: free resources of `struct config_store_data`

 Leak plugging.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ma/regex-no-regfree-after-comp-fail (2018-05-21) 1 commit
 - regex: do not call `regfree()` if compilation fails

 We used to call regfree() after regcomp() failed in some codepaths,
 which have been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ma/unpack-trees-free-msgs (2018-05-22) 4 commits
 - unpack_trees_options: free messages when done
 - argv-array: return the pushed string from argv_push*()
 - merge-recursive: provide pair of `unpack_trees_{start,finish}()`
 - merge: setup `opts` later in `checkout_fast_forward()`
 (this branch uses bp/merge-rename-config.)

 Leak plugging.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* rm/p4-submit-with-commit-option (2018-05-21) 1 commit
 - git-p4: add options --commit and --disable-rebase

 Needs sign-off.


* bw/remote-curl-compressed-responses (2018-05-23) 2 commits
 - remote-curl: accept compressed responses with protocol v2
 - remote-curl: accept all encodings supported by curl

 Our HTTP client code used to advertise that we accept gzip encoding
 from the other side; instead, just let cURL library to advertise
 and negotiate the best one.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* cc/tests-without-assuming-ref-files-backend (2018-05-23) 1 commit
 - t: make many tests depend less on the refs being files

 Quite a many tests assumed that newly created refs are made as
 loose refs using the files backend, which have been updated to use
 proper plumbing like rev-parse and update-ref, to avoid breakage
 once we start using different ref backends.

 Will merge to 'next'.

[Stalled]

* jm/cache-entry-from-mem-pool (2018-05-02) 5 commits
 - block alloc: add validations around cache_entry lifecyle
 - block alloc: allocate cache entries from mem_pool
 - mem-pool: fill out functionality
 - block alloc: add lifecycle APIs for cache_entry structs
 - read-cache: teach refresh_cache_entry() to take istate

 For a large tree, the index needs to hold many cache entries
 allocated on heap.  These cache entries are now allocated out of a
 dedicated memory pool to amortize malloc(3) overhead.

 Needs review.
 Is the "caller always knows which pool an entry came from and calls
 the right kind of free" a feasible approach?
 Oh, another thing, there is "lifecyle" typo in the title.


* ab/fetch-tags-noclobber (2018-05-16) 9 commits
 - fixup! push tests: assert re-pushing annotated tags
 - fetch: stop clobbering existing tags without --force
 - fetch tests: add a test clobbering tag behavior
 - fetch tests: correct a comment "remove it" -> "remove them"
 - push doc: correct lies about how push refspecs work
 - push tests: assert re-pushing annotated tags
 - push tests: add more testing for forced tag pushing
 - push tests: fix logic error in "push" test assertion
 - push tests: remove redundant 'git push' invocation

 Expecting a reboot of the discussion to take it to some conclusion
 and then a reroll.

 - add -p: optimize line selection for short hunks
 - add -p: allow line selection to be inverted
 - add -p: select individual hunk lines

 "git add -p" interactive interface learned to let users choose
 individual added/removed lines to be used in the operation, instead
 of accepting or rejecting a whole hunk.

 Expecting a reroll to reignite the discussion.

* jh/json-writer (2018-03-28) 1 commit
 - json_writer: new routines to create data in JSON format

 Preparatory code to later add json output for unspecified telemetry
 data.

 We do not add random code that does not have real users to our
 codebase, so let's have it wait until such a real code materializes
 before too long.


* hn/bisect-first-parent (2018-04-21) 1 commit
 - bisect: create 'bisect_flags' parameter in find_bisection()

 Preliminary code update to allow passing more flags down the
 bisection codepath in the future.

 We do not add random code that does not have real users to our
 codebase, so let's have it wait until such a real code materializes
 before too long.


* is/parsing-line-range (2018-04-27) 2 commits
 . log: prevent error if line range ends past end of file
 . blame: prevent error if range ends past end of file

 Parsing of -L[<N>][,[<M>]] parameters "git blame" and "git log"
 take has been tweaked.

 Seems to break a few tests.

 - t5560-http-backend-noserver.sh: add CONTENT_LENGTH cases
 - SQUASH???
 - http-backend: respect CONTENT_LENGTH as specified by rfc3875

 The http-backend (used for smart-http transport) used to slurp the
 whole input until EOF, without paying attention to CONTENT_LENGTH
 that is supplied in the environment and instead expecting the Web
 server to close the input stream.  This has been fixed.

 Expecting a reroll.
 Suggested fixes to be used when rerolling is queued, but I'd
 prefer _not_ squashing them myself.

 Also, it may be too complex solution for the problem.

* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2017-08-10) 1 commit
 . zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

 Needs resurrecting by making sure the fix is good and still applies
 (or adjusted to today's codebase).

 Many tests hardcode the raw object names, which would change once
 we migrate away from SHA-1.  While some of them must test against
 exact object names, most of them do not have to use hardcoded
 constants in the test.  The latter kind of tests have been updated
 to test the moral equivalent of the original without hardcoding the
 actual object names.

  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-22 at ffcb0a7aa7)
 + add status config and command line options for rename detection

 "git status" learned to honor a new status.renames configuration to
 skip rename detection, which could be useful for those who want to
 do so without disabling the default rename detection done by the
 "git diff" command.

* nd/commit-util-to-slab (2018-05-21) 15 commits
 - commit.h: delete 'util' field in struct commit
 - merge: use commit-slab in merge remote desc instead of commit->util
 - log: use commit-slab in prepare_bases() instead of commit->util
 - show-branch: note about its object flags usage
 - show-branch: use commit-slab for commit-name instead of commit->util

 - describe: use commit-slab for commit names instead of commit->util
 - blame: use commit-slab for blame suspects instead of commit->util
 - commit-slab: support shared commit-slab
 - commit-slab.h: code split

 The in-core "commit" object had an all-purpose "void *util" field,
 which was tricky to use especially in library-ish part of the
 code.  All of the existing uses of the field has been migrated to a
 more dedicated "commit-slab" mechanism and the field is eliminated.

* nd/diff-apply-ita (2018-05-14) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-22 at a15cc0ce1c)
 + apply: add --intent-to-add
 + diff: turn --ita-invisible-in-index on by default

 "git diff" compares the index and the working tree.  For paths
 added with intent-to-add bit, the command shows the full contents
 of them as added, but the paths themselves were not marked as new
 files.  They are now shown as new by default.

 "git apply" learned the "--intent-to-add" option so that an
 otherwise working-tree-only application of a patch will add new
 paths to the index marked with the "intent-to-add" bit.

* sb/submodule-merge-in-merge-recursive (2018-05-18) 3 commits
 - merge-recursive: give notice when submodule commit gets fast-forwarded
 - merge-recursive: i18n submodule merge output and respect verbosity
 - submodule.c: move submodule merging to merge-recursive.c

 By code restructuring of submodule merge in merge-recursive,
 informational messages from the codepath are now given using the
 same mechanism as other output, and honor the merge.verbosity
 configuration.  The code also learned to give a few new messages
 when a submodule three-way merge resolves cleanly when one side
 records a descendant of the commit chosen by the other side.

* sb/submodule-update-try-harder (2018-05-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-23 at 698e6707d7)
 + git-submodule.sh: try harder to fetch a submodule

 "git submodule update" attempts two different kinds of "git fetch"
 against the upstream repository to grab a commit bound at the
 submodule's path, but it incorrectly gave up if the first kind
 (i.e. a normal fetch) failed, making the second "last resort" one
 (i.e. fetching an exact commit object by object name) ineffective.
 This has been corrected.

 + sha1-name.c: move around the collect_ambiguous() function
 + git-p4: change "commitish" typo to "committish"
 + sha1-array.h: align function arguments
 + sha1-name.c: remove stray newline

 When a short hexadecimal string is used to name an object but there
 are multiple objects that share the string as the prefix of their
 names, the code lists these ambiguous candidates in a help message.
 These object names are now sorted according to their types for
 easier eyeballing.

 "git submodule update" and "git submodule add" supported the

 (this branch is used by ma/unpack-trees-free-msgs.)

 With merge.renames configuration set to false, the recursive merge
 strategy can be told not to spend cycles trying to find renamed
 paths and merge them accordingly.

 Will merge to 'master'.

* ds/generation-numbers (2018-05-22) 11 commits
 - commit-graph.txt: update design document
 - merge: check config before loading commits
 - commit: use generation number in remove_redundant()
 - commit: add short-circuit to paint_down_to_common()

 A recently added "commit-graph" datafile has learned to store
 pre-computed generation numbers to speed up the decisions to stop
 history traversal.

 Will merge to 'next'.

* sb/blame-color (2018-04-24) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-05-23 at 2e9c0daf0b)
 + builtin/blame: add new coloring scheme config
 + builtin/blame: highlight recently changed lines
 + builtin/blame: dim uninteresting metadata lines

 "git blame" learns to unhighlight uninteresting metadata from the
 originating commit on lines that are the same as the previous one,
 and also paint lines in different colors depending on the age of
 the commit.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/branch-l-0-deprecation (2018-03-26) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-11 at 9b2b0305dd)
 + branch: deprecate "-l" option
 + t: switch "branch -l" to "branch --create-reflog"
 + t3200: unset core.logallrefupdates when testing reflog creation
 (this branch is used by jk/branch-l-1-removal and jk/branch-l-2-reincarnation.)

 The "-l" option in "git branch -l" is an unfortunate short-hand for
 "--create-reflog", but many users, both old and new, somehow expect
 it to be something else, perhaps "--list".  This step deprecates
 the short-hand and warns about the future removal of the it when it
 is used.

 Will cook in 'next'.
 Perhaps merge to 'master' immediately after 2.18 release?


* jk/branch-l-1-removal (2018-03-26) 1 commit
 - branch: drop deprecated "-l" option
 (this branch is used by jk/branch-l-2-reincarnation; uses jk/branch-l-0-deprecation.)

 Following the "git branch -l" deprecation, the short-hand is removed.

 Will keep in 'pu'.


* jk/branch-l-2-reincarnation (2018-03-26) 1 commit
 - branch: make "-l" a synonym for "--list"
 (this branch uses jk/branch-l-0-deprecation and jk/branch-l-1-removal.)

 Following the "git branch -l" removal, "-l" is resurrected as a
 short-hand for "--list".

 Will keep in 'pu'.

* js/runtime-prefix-windows (2018-03-27) 5 commits
 . mingw/msvc: use the new-style RUNTIME_PREFIX helper
 . exec_cmd: provide a new-style RUNTIME_PREFIX helper for Windows
 . exec_cmd: RUNTIME_PREFIX on some POSIX systems
 . Makefile: add Perl runtime prefix support
 . Makefile: generate Perl header from template file

 The Windows port was the first that allowed Git to be installed
 anywhere by having its components refer to each other with relative
 pathnames.  The recent dj/runtime-prefix topic extends the idea to
 other platforms, and its approach has been adopted back in the
 Windows port.

 Ejected, as the parent topic dj/runtime-prefix covers Windows now.


* bp/fsexcludes (2018-04-16) 2 commits
 . fsmonitor: switch to use new fsexcludes logic and remove unused untracked cache based logic
 . fsexcludes: add a programmatic way to exclude files from git's working directory traversal logic

 Can we have a few lines summary here, just like we have for other
 topic ;-) I personally take the overlong title of these commits as
 a sign that they can further be simplified and cleaned up by
 splitting, focusing the scope, etc.

 Retracted.
