What's cooking in git.git (Oct 2015, #07; Fri, 30)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.

At tinyurl.com/gitCal, I drew a 14-week schedule for this cycle.  I
plan to be offline during weeks #7-#9 myself; hopefully we'll have
capable interim maintainers to take care of the list traffic in the
meantime as in past years.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

[Graduated to "master"]

* ar/clone-dissociate (2015-10-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-10-23 at 6bf746f)
 + clone: allow "--dissociate" without reference

 "git clone --dissociate" used to require that "--reference" was
 used at the same time, but you can create a new repository that
 borrows objects from another without using "--reference", namely
 with "clone --local" from a repository that borrows objects from
 other repositories.


* dt/name-hash-dir-entry-fix (2015-10-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-10-22 at 15eb519)
 + name-hash: don't reuse cache_entry in dir_entry

 The name-hash subsystem that is used to cope with case insensitive
 filesystems keeps track of directories and their on-filesystem
 cases for all the paths in the index by holding a pointer to a
 randomly chosen cache entry that is inside the directory (for its
 ce->ce_name component).  This pointer was not updated even when the
 cache entry was removed from the index, leading to use after free.
 This was fixed by recording the path for each directory instead of
 borrowing cache entries and restructuring the API somewhat.


* gr/rebase-i-drop-warn (2015-10-28) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-10-29 at 4bfda25)
 + rebase-i: work around Windows CRLF line endings
 + t3404: "rebase -i" gets broken when insn sheet uses CR/LF line endings

 Recent update to "rebase -i" that tries to sanity check the edited
 insn sheet before it uses it has become too picky on Windows where
 CRLF left by the editor is turned into a trailing CR on the line
 read via the "read" built-in command.


* jc/add-u-A-default-to-top (2015-10-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-10-29 at 15aea9c)
 + add: simplify -u/-A without pathspec

 "git --literal-pathspecs add -u/-A" without any command line
 argument misbehaved ever since Git 2.0.


* jc/am-mailinfo-direct (2015-10-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-10-22 at ca15014)
 + am: make direct call to mailinfo
 (this branch is used by jc/mailinfo; uses jc/mailinfo-lib.)

 "git am" used to spawn "git mailinfo" via run_command() API once
 per each patch, but learned to make a direct call to mailinfo()
 instead.


* jc/em-dash-in-doc (2015-10-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-10-23 at 31a08ce)
 + Documentation: AsciiDoc spells em-dash as double-dashes, not triple

 AsciiDoc markup fixes.


* jc/everyday-markup (2015-10-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-10-22 at 0a2702d)
 + Documentation/everyday: match undefline with the text

 AsciiDoc markup fixes.


* jc/mailinfo-lib (2015-10-21) 34 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-10-22 at 405bd66)
 + mailinfo: remove calls to exit() and die() deep in the callchain
 + mailinfo: handle charset conversion errors in the caller
 + mailinfo: libify
 + mailinfo: keep the parsed log message in a strbuf
 + mailinfo: handle_commit_msg() shouldn't be called after finding patchbreak
 + mailinfo: move content/content_top to struct mailinfo
 + mailinfo: move [ps]_hdr_data to struct mailinfo
 + mailinfo: move cmitmsg and patchfile to struct mailinfo
 + mailinfo: move charset to struct mailinfo
 + mailinfo: move transfer_encoding to struct mailinfo
 + mailinfo: move check for metainfo_charset to convert_to_utf8()
 + mailinfo: move metainfo_charset to struct mailinfo
 + mailinfo: move use_scissors and use_inbody_headers to struct mailinfo
 + mailinfo: move add_message_id and message_id to struct mailinfo
 + mailinfo: move patch_lines to struct mailinfo
 + mailinfo: move filter/header stage to struct mailinfo
 + mailinfo: move global "FILE *fin, *fout" to struct mailinfo
 + mailinfo: move keep_subject & keep_non_patch_bracket to struct mailinfo
 + mailinfo: introduce "struct mailinfo" to hold globals
 + mailinfo: move global "line" into mailinfo() function
 + mailinfo: do not let find_boundary() touch global "line" directly
 + mailinfo: do not let handle_boundary() touch global "line" directly
 + mailinfo: do not let handle_body() touch global "line" directly
 + mailinfo: get rid of function-local static states
 + mailinfo: move definition of MAX_HDR_PARSED closer to its use
 + mailinfo: move cleanup_space() before its users
 + mailinfo: move check_header() after the helpers it uses
 + mailinfo: move read_one_header_line() closer to its callers
 + mailinfo: move handle_boundary() lower
 + mailinfo: plug strbuf leak during continuation line handling
 + mailinfo: explicitly close file handle to the patch output
 + mailinfo: fix an off-by-one error in the boundary stack
 + mailinfo: fold decode_header_bq() into decode_header()
 + mailinfo: remove a no-op call convert_to_utf8(it, "")
 (this branch is used by jc/am-mailinfo-direct and jc/mailinfo.)

 The implementation of "git mailinfo" was refactored so that a
 mailinfo() function can be directly called from inside a process.


* jk/delete-modechange-conflict (2015-10-26) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-10-29 at 59ce69d)
 + merge: detect delete/modechange conflict
 + t6031: generalize for recursive and resolve strategies
 + t6031: move triple-rename test to t3030

 Merging a branch that removes a path and another that changes the
 mode bits on the same path should have conflicted at the path, but
 it didn't and silently favoured the removal.


* jk/merge-file-exit-code (2015-10-29) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-10-29 at 6ae613f)
 + merge-file: clamp exit code to maximum 127

 "git merge-file" tried to signal how many conflicts it found, which
 obviously would not work well when there are too many of them.


* jk/war-on-sprintf (2015-10-23) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-10-23 at 3a94851)
 + compat/mingw.c: remove printf format warning
 + read_branches_file: plug a FILE* leak


* js/imap-send-curl-compilation-fix (2015-10-26) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-10-29 at 9c4f3eb)
 + imap-send: only use CURLOPT_LOGIN_OPTIONS if it is actually available

 "git imap-send" did not compile well with older version of cURL library.


* js/misc-fixes (2015-10-26) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-10-29 at 8990f29)
 + Correct fscanf formatting string for I64u values
 + Silence GCC's "cast of pointer to integer of a different size" warning
 + Squelch warning about an integer overflow

 Various compilation fixes and squelching of warnings.


* mk/blame-error-message (2015-10-26) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-10-29 at 82a1b18)
 + blame: fix option name in error message

 The error message from "git blame --contents --reverse" incorrectly
 talked about "--contents --children".


* rp/link-curl-before-ssl (2015-10-21) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-10-22 at dad4fc6)
 + configure.ac: detect ssl need with libcurl
 + Makefile: make curl-config path configurable
 + Makefile: link libcurl before zlib

 The linkage order of libraries was wrong in places around libcurl.


* rs/pop-commit (2015-10-26) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-10-29 at f24d8ed)
 + use pop_commit() for consuming the first entry of a struct commit_list

 Code simplification.


* tk/sigchain-unnecessary-post-tempfile (2015-10-22) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-10-22 at b049f0a)
 + shallow: remove unused #include "sigchain.h"
 + read-cache: remove unused #include "sigchain.h"
 + diff: remove unused #include "sigchain.h"
 + credential-cache--daemon: remove unused #include "sigchain.h"

 Remove no-longer used #include.


* xf/user-manual-ff (2015-10-26) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-10-29 at 488c4f8)
 + user-manual: fix the description of fast-forward


* xf/user-manual-markup (2015-10-22) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-10-22 at cd33c83)
 + Documentation: match undefline with the text in old release notes
 + Documentation: match underline with the text
 + Documentation: fix header markup

 AsciiDoc markup fixes.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* sb/submodule-parallel-update (2015-10-29) 9 commits
 - clone: allow an explicit argument for parallel submodule clones
 - submodule update: expose parallelism to the user
 - git submodule update: have a dedicated helper for cloning
 - fetching submodules: respect `submodule.jobs` config option
 - submodule config: update parse_config()
 - submodule config: remove name_and_item_from_var
 - submodule config: keep update strategy around
 - run_processes_parallel: add output to tracing messages
 - Merge branch 'sb/submodule-parallel-fetch' into sb/submodule-parallel-update
 (this branch uses sb/submodule-parallel-fetch.)

 Builds on top of the "fetch --recurse-submodules" work to introduce
 parallel downloading into multiple submodules for "submodule update".

 Waiting for reviews.


* jc/strbuf-gets (2015-10-28) 17 commits
 - test-sha1-array: read command stream with strbuf_gets()
 - grep: read -f file with strbuf_gets()
 - send-pack: read list of refs with strbuf_gets()

 - update-index: read --index-info with strbuf_gets()
 - check-attr, check-ignore, checkout-index: read paths with strbuf_gets()
 - strbuf: add strbuf_gets()

 Teach codepaths that communicate with users by reading text files
 to be more lenient to editors that write CRLF-terminated lines.
 Note that this is only about communication with Git, like feeding
 list of object names from the standard input instead of from the
 command line, and does not involve files in the working tree.

 Waiting for reviews.


* eg/p4-submit-catch-failure (2015-10-30) 1 commit
 - git-p4: clean up after p4 submit failure

 Just like the working tree is cleaned up when the user cancelled
 submission in P4Submit.applyCommit(), clean up the mess if "p4
 submit" fails.

 Needs an update to test.


* jk/initialization-fix-to-add-submodule-odb (2015-10-28) 1 commit
 - add_submodule_odb: initialize alt_odb list earlier

 We peek objects from submodule's object store by linking it to the
 list of alternate object databases, but the code to do so forgot to
 correctly initialize the list.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ep/ident-with-getaddrinfo (2015-10-30) 1 commit
 - (NEEDSWORK $gmane/280507) ident.c: add support for IPv6

 A build without NO_IPv6 used to use gethostbyname() when guessing
 user's hostname, instead of getaddrinfo() that is used in other
 codepaths in such a build.
 
 Waiting for a reroll.
 ($gmane/280507)


* js/git-gdb (2015-10-30) 1 commit
 - test: facilitate debugging Git executables in tests with gdb

 Allow easier debugging of a single "git" invocation in our test
 scripts.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* kn/for-each-branch (2015-10-30) 1 commit
 - ref-filter: fallback on alphabetical comparison

 Using the timestamp based criteria in "git branch --sort" did not
 tiebreak branches that point at commits with the same timestamp (or
 the same commit), making the resulting output unstable.

 Will merge to 'next' and then quickly to 'master'.


* ea/checkout-progress (2015-10-30) 2 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - checkout: add --progress option

 "git checkout" did not follow the usual "--[no-]progress"
 convention and implemented only "--quiet" that is essentially
 "--no-progress".

 Waiting for a reroll.


* jc/test-must-fail-with-sigpipe (2015-10-30) 1 commit
 - test: accept death by SIGPIPE as a valid failure mode

  Waiting for reviews.

[Stalled]

* dk/gc-idx-wo-pack (2015-08-17) 3 commits
 - DONTMERGE: log message, grace-period and tests $gmane/276058
 - gc: remove stale .idx files without corresponding .pack file
 - prepare_packed_git(): refactor garbage reporting in pack directory

 Having a leftover .idx file without corresponding .pack file in
 the repository hurts performance; "git gc" learned to prune them.

 Waiting for a reroll.


* nd/ita-cleanup (2015-09-06) 6 commits
 - grep: make it clear i-t-a entries are ignored
 - checkout(-index): do not checkout i-t-a entries
 - apply: make sure check_preimage() does not leave empty file on error
 - apply: fix adding new files on i-t-a entries
 - add and use a convenience macro ce_intent_to_add()
 - blame: remove obsolete comment

 Paths that have been told the index about with "add -N" are not yet
 in the index, but various commands behaved as if they already are.

 Some commits need better explanation.

 Waiting for a reroll.


* ld/p4-detached-head (2015-09-09) 2 commits
 - git-p4: work with a detached head
 - git-p4: add failing test for submit from detached head

 Will be rerolled.
 ($gmane/277574)


* mg/httpd-tests-update-for-apache-2.4 (2015-04-08) 2 commits

 - t/lib-httpd: load mod_unixd

 This is the first two commits in a three-patch series $gmane/266962

* wp/sha1-name-negative-match (2015-06-08) 2 commits
 - sha1_name.c: introduce '^{/!-<negative pattern>}' notation
 - test for '!' handling in rev-parse's named commits

 Introduce "branch^{/!-<pattern>}" notation to name a commit
 reachable from branch that does not match the given pattern.

* ak/format-patch-odir-config (2015-06-19) 1 commit
 - format-patch: introduce format.outputDirectory configuration

 Reroll exists but didn't pick it up as it seemed to be still
 collecting review comments.

 Becoming tired of waiting for a reroll.
 ($gmane/272180).


* jc/diff-b-m (2015-02-23) 5 commits
 . WIPWIP
 . WIP: diff-b-m
 - diffcore-rename: allow easier debugging
 - diffcore-rename.c: add locate_rename_src()
 - diffcore-break: allow debugging

 "git diff -B -M" produced incorrect patch when the postimage of a
 completely rewritten file is similar to the preimage of a removed
 file; such a resulting file must not be expressed as a rename from
 other place.

 The fix in this patch is broken, unfortunately.

* pt/http-socks-proxy (2015-10-26) 1 commit
 - remote-http(s): support SOCKS proxies

 Add support for talking http/https over socks proxy.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* da/difftool (2015-10-29) 1 commit
 - difftool: ignore symbolic links in use_wt_file

 The code to prepare the working tree side of temporary directory
 for the "dir-diff" feature forgot that symbolic links need not be
 copied (or symlinked) to the temporary area, as the code already
 special cases and overwrites them.  Besides, it was wrong to try
 computing the object name of the target of symbolic link, which may
 not even exist or may be a directory.

 Waiting for response.


* mh/notes-allow-reading-treeish (2015-10-08) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-10-23 at 8a697f0)
 + notes: allow treeish expressions as notes ref
 + Merge branch 'jk/notes-dwim-doc' into next
 + Merge branch 'jc/merge-drop-old-syntax' into next
 (this branch uses jc/merge-drop-old-syntax.)

 Some "git notes" operations, e.g. "git log --notes=<note>", should
 be able to read notes from any tree-ish that is shaped like a notes
 tree, but the notes infrastructure required that the argument must
 be a ref under refs/notes/.  Loosen it to require a valid ref only
 when the operation would update the notes (in which case we must
 have a place to store the updated notes tree, iow, a ref).

 Will cook in 'next'.


* dt/refs-backend-pre-vtable (2015-10-15) 26 commits
 - refs: break out ref conflict checks
 - refs: make files_log_ref_write functions public
 - initdb: move safe_create_dir into common code

 - refs.c: move delete_pseudoref and delete_ref to the common code
 - refs.c: move update_ref to refs.c
 - refs.c: add a new refs.c file to hold all common refs code
 - refs-be-files.c: rename refs to refs-be-files
 - refs: make repack_without_refs and is_branch public
 - refs.c: create a public version of verify_refname_available
 - Merge branch 'jk/war-on-sprintf' into HEAD

 The early part of the pluggable ref backend series, which sifts the
 ref API functions into two bins: the filesystem backend specific
 ones and the generic API functions.  The next step will start
 introducing the framework to dispatch generic calls to specific
 backend implementation(s) and then finally plug a new backend that
 is different from the file backend.

 Reroll exists, but haven't picked up yet.


* jc/mailinfo (2015-10-21) 1 commit
 - mailinfo: ignore in-body header that we do not care about

 Some people write arbitrary garbage at the beginning of a piece of
 e-mail (or after -- >8 -- scissors -- >8 -- line) in the commit log
 message and expect them to be discarded, even though "From:" and
 "Subject:" are the only documented in-body headers that you are
 supposed to have there.  Allow some garbage (specifically, what may
 look like RFC2822 headers like "MIME-Version: ...") to be there and
 ignore them.

 I have a feeling that that this is a step in a wrong direction.
 Comments?


* js/am-3-merge-recursive-direct (2015-10-12) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-10-23 at dc631e5)
 + am: make a direct call to merge_recursive
 + merge_recursive_options: introduce the "gently" flag

 The merge_recursive_generic() function has been made a bit safer to
 call from inside a process.  "git am -3" was taught to make a direct
 call to the function when falling back to three-way merge.

 Will keep in 'next' during the 2.7 cycle.


* sg/pretty-more-date-mode-format (2015-10-07) 1 commit
 - pretty: add format specifiers for short and raw date formats

 Introduce "%as" and "%aR" placeholders for "log --format" to show
 the author date in the short and raw formats.

 I have a feeling that that this is a step in a wrong direction.
 Comments?


* kn/for-each-branch-remainder (2015-10-02) 9 commits
 - branch: implement '--format' option
 - branch: use ref-filter printing APIs
 - ref-filter: make %(upstream:track) prints "[gone]" for invalid upstreams
 - ref-filter: introduce format_ref_array_item()
 - ref-filter: adopt get_head_description() from branch.c
 - ref-filter: modify "%(objectname:short)" to take length
 - ref-filter: add support for %(path) atom
 - ref-filter: implement %(if:equals=<string>) and %(if:notequals=<string>)
 - ref-filter: implement %(if), %(then), and %(else) atoms

 More unification among "branch -l", "tag -l" and "for-each-ref --format".

 Expecting a reroll.

* jk/graph-format-padding (2015-09-14) 1 commit
 - pretty: pass graph width to pretty formatting for use in '%>|(N)'

 Redefine the way '%>|(N)' padding and the "--graph" option
 interacts.  It has been that the available columns to display the
 log message was measured from the edge of the area the graph ended,
 but with this it becomes the beginning of the entire output.

 I have a suspicion that 50% of the users would appreciate this
 change, and the remainder see this break their expectation.  If
 that is the case, we might need to introduce a similar but
 different alignment operator so that this new behaviour is
 available to those who want to use it, without negatively affecting
 existing uses.

 Undecided.

* sb/submodule-parallel-fetch (2015-10-21) 14 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-10-23 at 8f04bbd)
 + run-command: fix missing output from late callbacks
 + test-run-command: increase test coverage
 + test-run-command: test for gracefully aborting
 + run-command: initialize the shutdown flag
 + run-command: clear leftover state from child_process structure

 + submodules: allow parallel fetching, add tests and documentation
 + fetch_populated_submodules: use new parallel job processing
 + run-command: add an asynchronous parallel child processor
 + sigchain: add command to pop all common signals
 + strbuf: add strbuf_read_once to read without blocking
 + xread_nonblock: add functionality to read from fds without blocking
 + xread: poll on non blocking fds
 + submodule.c: write "Fetching submodule <foo>" to stderr
 (this branch is used by sb/submodule-parallel-update.)

 Add a framework to spawn a group of processes in parallel, and use
 it to run "git fetch --recurse-submodules" in parallel.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* ad/cygwin-wants-rename (2015-08-07) 1 commit
 - config.mak.uname: Cygwin needs OBJECT_CREATION_USES_RENAMES

 Will hold.
 ($gmane/275680).


* jc/rerere-multi (2015-09-14) 7 commits
 - rerere: do use multiple variants
 - t4200: rerere a merge with two identical conflicts
 - rerere: allow multiple variants to exist
 - rerere: delay the recording of preimage
 - rerere: handle leftover rr-cache/$ID directory and postimage files
 - rerere: scan $GIT_DIR/rr-cache/$ID when instantiating a rerere_id
 - rerere: split conflict ID further

 "git rerere" can encounter two or more files with the same conflict
 signature that have to be resolved in different ways, but there was
 no way to record these separate resolutions.


* jc/merge-drop-old-syntax (2015-04-29) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-10-07 at 50fed71)
 + merge: drop 'git merge <message> HEAD <commit>' syntax
 (this branch is used by mh/notes-allow-reading-treeish.)

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2015-05-28

 Stop supporting "git merge <message> HEAD <commit>" syntax that has
 been deprecated since October 2007.  It has been reported that
 git-gui still uses the deprecated syntax, which needs to be fixed
 before this final step can proceed.

 Will keep in 'next' during the 2.7 cycle.
