What's cooking in git.git (May 2010, #05; Tue, 25)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones
marked with '.' do not appear in any of the integration branches, but I am
still holding onto them.

Many topics that have been cooking since 1.7.1 pre-release freeze period
are now in master; maybe it is a good time to start freezing feature
branches for 1.7.2---I think I said I'll keep this cycle shorter, no?

Btw, fwiw, I recently took a position with Google.  The primary
development machine has been unpacked but I still haven't managed to get
back to speed yet.

* jc/rev-list-ancestry-path (2010-04-20) 1 commit

Just an illustration patch.  merge simplification logic used when
pathspecs are in effect interacts with this rather badly.

* js/rebase-origin-x (2010-02-05) 1 commit

* jp/hold-string-list-sanity (2010-04-06) 9 commits
 . string_list: Fix argument order for string_list_append
 . Merge branch 'sr/remote-helper-export' into HEAD
 . Merge branch 'js/grep-open' into HEAD
 . Merge branch 'sb/fmt-merge-msg' into HEAD
 . string_list: Fix argument order for string_list_lookup

 (this branch uses js/grep-open.)

Building this on top of slushy codebase is not a very promising endeavor.
Good thing to do, but it came at a bad time.
