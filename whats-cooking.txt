Subject: What's cooking in git.git (Aug 2019, #05; Wed, 21)
X-master-at: 5fa0f5238b0cd46cfe7f6fa76c3f526ea98148d9

What's cooking in git.git (Aug 2019, #05; Wed, 21)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

The first batch of topics post 2.23 will be merged to 'master' and
'next' will be rewound to become empty, soon.  After that, 'next'
will grow merging only smaller fixes and cleanup topics first.
Bigger stuff will then follow after the dust settles.  All of the
above hopefully will happen before the end of the month.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* cb/curl-use-xmalloc (2019-08-15) 1 commit
 - http: use xmalloc with cURL
 (this branch uses jk/drop-release-pack-memory.)

 Tell cURL library to use the same malloc() implementation, with the
 xmalloc() wrapper, as the rest of the system, for consistency.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sg/diff-indent-heuristic-non-experimental (2019-08-15) 1 commit
 - diff: 'diff.indentHeuristic' is no longer experimental

 We promoted the "indent heuristics" that decides where to split
 diff hunks from experimental to the default a few years ago, but
 some stale documentation still marked it as experimental, which has
 been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* en/checkout-mismerge-fix (2019-08-16) 1 commit
 - checkout: remove duplicate code

 Fix a mismerge that happened in 2.22 timeframe.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 - merge-recursive: provide a better label for diff3 common ancestor
 - merge-recursive: enforce opt->ancestor != NULL when calling merge_trees()
 - checkout: provide better conflict hunk description with detached HEAD
 - merge-recursive: be consistent with assert

 The merge-recursive machiery is one of the most complex parts of
 the system that accumulated cruft over time.  This large series
 cleans up the implementation quite a bit.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 superproject, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* mp/for-each-ref-missing-name-or-email (2019-08-19) 1 commit
 - ref-filter: initialize empty name or email fields

 "for-each-ref" and friends that shows refs did not protect themselves
 against ancient tags that did not record tagger names when asked to
 show "%(taggername)", which have been corrected.

 May want a test or two.

[Stalled]

* js/trace2-json-schema (2019-07-25) 3 commits
 . ci: run trace2 schema validation in the CI suite
 . trace2: add a schema validator for trace2 events
 . trace2: add a JSON schema for trace2 events

 The JSON output produced by "trace2" subsystem now has JSON schema
 defined on it, to allow us validate the output and catch deviation.

 The CI integration may be a bit too heavy-handed.


* jn/unknown-index-extensions (2018-11-21) 2 commits
 - index: offer advice for unknown index extensions
 - index: do not warn about unrecognized extensions

 A bit too alarming warning given when unknown index extensions
 exist is getting revamped.

 Expecting a reroll.


* jc/format-patch-delay-message-id (2019-04-05) 1 commit
 - format-patch: move message-id and related headers to the end

 The location "git format-patch --thread" adds the Message-Id:
 header in the series of header fields has been moved down, which
 may help working around a suspected bug in GMail MSA, reported at
 <CAHk-=whP1stFZNAaJiMi5eZ9rj0MRt20Y_yHVczZPH+O01d+sA@mail.gmail.com>

 Waiting for feedback to see if it truly helps.

 WIP for allowing a response to "git fetch" to instruct the bulk of
 the pack contents to be instead taken from elsewhere (aka CDN).


* js/protocol-advertise-multi (2018-12-28) 1 commit
 - protocol: advertise multiple supported versions

 The transport layer has been updated so that the protocol version
 used can be negotiated between the parties, by the initiator
 listing the protocol versions it is willing to talk, and the other
 side choosing from one of them.

 Expecting a reroll.

* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2018-10-15) 1 commit
 - zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".


* dl/remote-save-to-push (2018-12-11) 1 commit
 - remote: add --save-to-push option to git remote set-url

 "git remote set-url" learned a new option that moves existing value
 of the URL field to pushURL field of the remote before replacing
 the URL field with a new value.

 Anybody who wants to champion this topic?
 I am personally not yet quite convinced if this is worth pursuing.

  (merged to 'next' on 2019-08-14 at 3010a7d19f)
 + t/perf: rename duplicate-numbered test script

 Test & perf scripts must use unique numeric prefix, but a pair
 shared the same number, which is fixed here.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 The "git am" based backend of "git rebase" ignored the result of
 updating ".gitattributes" done in one step when replaying
 subsequent steps.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/drop-release-pack-memory (2019-08-13) 1 commit
 - packfile: drop release_pack_memory()
 (this branch is used by cb/curl-use-xmalloc.)

 xmalloc() used to have a mechanism to ditch memory and address
 space resources as the last resort upon seeing an allocation
 failure from the underlying malloc(), which made the code complex
 and thread-unsafe with dubious benefit, as major memory resource
 users already do limit their uses with various other mechanisms.
 It has been simplified away.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 . fetch: make --jobs control submodules and remotes
 . fetch: add the --submodule-fetch-jobs option
 . fetch: add the fetch.jobs config key
 . fetch: add the "--fetch-jobs" option
 . fetch: rename max_children to max_children_for_submodules

 "git fetch --jobs" is getting taught to also run fetch jobs in
 parallel when fetching from multiple remote repositories.


* cb/fetch-set-upstream (2019-08-19) 1 commit
 - pull, fetch: add --set-upstream option

 "git fetch" learned "--set-upstream" option to help those who first
 clone from their private fork they intend to push to, add the true
 upstream via "git remote add" and then "git fetch" from it.


* sg/commit-graph-validate (2019-08-05) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-08-09 at 87f61abb73)
 + commit-graph: error out on invalid commit oids in 'write --stdin-commits'
 + commit-graph: turn a group of write-related macro flags into an enum
 + t5318-commit-graph: use 'test_expect_code'

 The code to write commit-graph over given commit object names has
 been made a bit more robust.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* sg/show-failed-test-names (2019-08-05) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-08-09 at c49ece8a0d)
 + tests: show the test name and number at the start of verbose output
 + t0000-basic: use realistic test script names in the verbose tests

 The first line of verbose output from each test piece now carries
 the test name and number to help scanning with eyeballs.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* js/pre-merge-commit-hook (2019-08-07) 4 commits
 - merge: --no-verify to bypass pre-merge-commit hook
 - git-merge: honor pre-merge-commit hook

* jk/eoo (2019-08-06) 3 commits
 - gitcli: document --end-of-options
 - parse-options: allow --end-of-options as a synonym for "--"
 - revision: allow --end-of-options to end option parsing

 The command line parser learned "--end-of-options" notation; the
 standard convention for scripters to have hardcoded set of options
 first on the command line, and force the command to treat end-user
 input as non-options, has been to use "--" as the delimiter, but
 that would not work for commands that use "--" as a delimiter
 between revs and pathspec.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/repo-init-cleanup (2019-08-06) 3 commits
 - config: stop checking whether the_repository is NULL
 - common-main: delay trace2 initialization

  (merged to 'next' on 2019-08-09 at 6bd6c85fbb)
 + pack-refs: always refresh after taking the lock file

 "git pack-refs" can lose refs that are created while running, which
 is getting corrected.

* vn/restore-empty-ita-corner-case-fix (2019-08-02) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-08-09 at ad2d7630d1)
 + restore: add test for deleted ita files
 + checkout.c: unstage empty deleted ita files

 "git checkout" and "git restore" to re-populate the index from a
 tree-ish (typically HEAD) did not work correctly for a path that
 was removed and then added again with the intent-to-add bit, when
 the corresponding working tree file was empty.  This has been
 corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ds/feature-macros (2019-08-13) 6 commits
 - repo-settings: create feature.experimental setting

  (merged to 'next' on 2019-08-02 at e1a46a195f)
 + grep: fix worktree case in submodules

 "git grep --recurse-submodules" that looks at the working tree
 files looked at the contents in the index in submodules, instead of
 files in the working tree.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/tree-walk-overflow (2019-08-01) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-08-02 at 116467c77a)

 Test fix.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* vn/reset-deleted-ita (2019-07-26) 1 commit
 - reset: unstage empty deleted ita files

 "git reset HEAD [<pathspec>]" did not reset an empty file that was

 - sequencer: rename amend_author to author_to_rename
 - rebase -i: support --committer-date-is-author-date
 - sequencer: add NULL checks under read_author_script
 - rebase -i: add --ignore-whitespace flag

 "git rebase -i" learned a few options that are known by "git
 rebase" proper.

 Looking good.

 - .gitignore: there is no longer a built-in `git-rebase--interactive`
 - t3400: stop referring to the scripted rebase
 - Drop unused git-rebase--am.sh

 "git rebase --rebase-merges" learned to drive different merge
 strategies and pass strategy specific options to them.

 Will merge to 'next'.

* ab/pcre-jit-fixes (2019-08-19) 8 commits
 - grep: under --debug, show whether PCRE JIT is enabled
 - grep: do not enter PCRE2_UTF mode on fixed matching
 - grep: stess test PCRE v2 on invalid UTF-8 data
 - grep: create a "is_fixed" member in "grep_pat"
 - grep: consistently use "p->fixed" in compile_regexp()
 - grep: stop using a custom JIT stack with PCRE v1
 - grep: stop "using" a custom JIT stack with PCRE v2
 - grep: remove overly paranoid BUG(...) code
 (this branch uses ab/no-kwset.)

 A few simplification and bugfixes to PCRE interface.


* md/list-objects-filter-combo (2019-06-28) 10 commits
 - list-objects-filter-options: make parser void
 - list-objects-filter-options: clean up use of ALLOC_GROW
 - list-objects-filter-options: allow mult. --filter
 - strbuf: give URL-encoding API a char predicate fn
 - list-objects-filter-options: make filter_spec a string_list
 - list-objects-filter-options: move error check up
 - list-objects-filter: implement composite filters
 - list-objects-filter-options: always supply *errbuf
 - list-objects-filter: put omits set in filter struct
 - list-objects-filter: encapsulate filter components

 The list-objects-filter API (used to create a sparse/lazy clone)
 learned to take a combined filter specification.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* cc/multi-promisor (2019-06-25) 15 commits
 - Move core_partial_clone_filter_default to promisor-remote.c
 - Move repository_format_partial_clone to promisor-remote.c
 - Remove fetch-object.{c,h} in favor of promisor-remote.{c,h}
 - remote: add promisor and partial clone config to the doc
 - partial-clone: add multiple remotes in the doc
 - t0410: test fetching from many promisor remotes
 - builtin/fetch: remove unique promisor remote limitation
 - promisor-remote: parse remote.*.partialclonefilter
 - Use promisor_remote_get_direct() and has_promisor_remote()
 - promisor-remote: use repository_format_partial_clone
 - promisor-remote: add promisor_remote_reinit()
 - promisor-remote: implement promisor_remote_get_direct()
 - Add initial support for many promisor remotes
 - fetch-object: make functions return an error code
 - t0410: remove pipes after git commands

 Teach the lazy clone machinery that there can be more than one
 promisor remote and consult them in order when downloading missing
 objects on demand.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jc/format-patch-noclobber (2019-02-22) 1 commit
 - format-patch: --no-clobber refrains from overwriting output files

 "git format-patch" used to overwrite an existing patch/cover-letter
 file.  A new "--no-clobber" option stops it.

 Will discard.


* dl/rebase-i-keep-base (2019-04-25) 6 commits
 - rebase: teach rebase --keep-base
 - rebase: fast-forward --fork-point in more cases
 - rebase: fast-forward --onto in more cases
 - rebase: refactor can_fast_forward into goto tower
 - t3432: test rebase fast-forward behavior
 - t3431: add rebase --fork-point tests

 "git rebase --keep-base <upstream>" tries to find the original base
 of the topic being rebased and rebase on top of that same base,
 which is useful when running the "git rebase -i" (and its limited
 variant "git rebase -x").

 The command also has learned to fast-forward in more cases where it
 can instead of replaying to recreate identical commits.

 On hold.

* ab/no-kwset (2019-07-01) 10 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-07-15 at ed0479ce3d)
 + grep: use PCRE v2 for optimized fixed-string search
 + grep: remove the kwset optimization
 + grep: drop support for \0 in --fixed-strings <pattern>
 + grep: make the behavior for NUL-byte in patterns sane
 + grep tests: move binary pattern tests into their own file
 + grep tests: move "grep binary" alongside the rest
 + grep: inline the return value of a function call used only once
 + t4210: skip more command-line encoding tests on MinGW
 + grep: don't use PCRE2?_UTF8 with "log --encoding=<non-utf8>"
 + log tests: test regex backends in "--encode=<enc>" tests
 (this branch is used by ab/pcre-jit-fixes.)

 Retire use of kwset library, which is an optimization for looking
 for fixed strings, with use of pcre2 JIT.

 Kicked out of 'next' to give the topic a chance to get rebooted.
