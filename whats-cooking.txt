What's cooking in git.git (Aug 2023, #07; Fri, 25)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and
aren't considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL
to a message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity (of course they can be resubmit when new interests
arise).

The cycle for 2.43 has started.  Hopefully we can drain the topics
that have been cooking in 'next' during the pre-release freeze
period down to 'master' by the end of next week.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

Release tarballs are available at:

 + branch: error message deleting a branch in use

 A message written in olden time prevented a branch from getting
 checked out saying it is already checked out elsewhere, but these
 days, we treat a branch that is being bisected or rebased just like
 a branch that is checked out and protect it.  Rephrase the message
 to say that the branch is in use.

 - status: fix branch shown when not only bisecting

 "git status" is taught to show both the branch being bisected and
 being rebased when both are in effect at the same time.

 Needs review.

 + commit-graph: fix small leak with invalid changedPathsVersion
  (merged to 'next' on 2023-08-03 at d99958c287)
 + commit-graph: new filter ver. that fixes murmur3
 + repo-settings: introduce commitgraph.changedPathsVersion
 + t4216: test changed path filters with high bit paths

 + bloom.h: make `load_bloom_filter_from_graph()` public
 + t/helper/test-read-graph.c: extract `dump_graph_info()`
 + gitformat-commit-graph: describe version 2 of BDAT

 The Bloom filter used for path limited history traversal was broken
 on systems whose "char" is unsigned; update the implementation and
 bump the format version to 2.

 Reverted out of 'next', superseded by the tb/path-filter-fix topic.
