What's cooking in git.git (Apr 2024, #02; Wed, 3)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and
aren't considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL
to a message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity (of course they can be resubmit when new interests
arise).

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-scm/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/

* bl/cherry-pick-empty (2024-03-25) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2024-03-28 at 22e8e4a68e)
 + cherry-pick: add `--empty` for more robust redundant commit handling
 + cherry-pick: enforce `--keep-redundant-commits` incompatibility
 + sequencer: do not require `allow_empty` for redundant commit options
 + sequencer: handle unborn branch with `--allow-empty`
 + rebase: update `--empty=ask` to `--empty=stop`
 + docs: clean up `--empty` formatting in git-rebase(1) and git-am(1)
 + docs: address inaccurate `--empty` default with `--exec`

 Allow git-cherry-pick(1) to automatically drop redundant commits via
 a new `--empty` option, similar to the `--empty` options for
 git-rebase(1) and git-am(1). Includes a soft deprecation of
 `--keep-redundant-commits` as well as some related docs changes and
 sequencer code cleanup.
