What's cooking in git.git (Jan 2023, #03; Mon, 9)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a future
release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and aren't
considered "accepted" at all.  A topic without enough support may be
discarded after a long period of no activity.

A handful of topics have graduated to 'master'.  On 'seen', there
are many topics accumulated that need reviews and review responses.
I'll be offline for a few days and will reappear later this week.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

Release tarballs are available at:

 + tests(mingw): avoid very slow `mingw_test_cmp`

 Use `git diff --no-index` as a test_cmp on Windows.

 We'd probably need to revisit "do we really want to, and have to,
 lose CRLF vs LF?" later, at which time we may be able to further
 clean this up by replacing "git diff --no-index" with "diff -u".
