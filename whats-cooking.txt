Subject: What's cooking in git.git (Jul 2014, #04; Tue, 22)

What's cooking in git.git (Jul 2014, #04; Tue, 22)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.

We would need to start slowing down to prepare for -rc0 preview at
the end of this week and then feature freeze.  Some topics that
joined 'next' late may want to stay there for the remainder of this
cycle.  Many of the accumulated fixes have been flushed to 'maint'
and Git 2.0.2 has been tagged.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* mb/local-clone-after-applying-insteadof (2014-07-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-07-21 at ebe07c2)
 + use local cloning if insteadOf makes a local URL

 Apply the "if cloning from a local disk, physically copy repository
 using hardlinks, unless otherwise told not to with --no-local"
 optimization when url.*.insteadOf mechanism rewrites a "git clone
 $URL" that refers to a repository over the network to a clone from
 a local disk.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* nd/path-max-is-better-than-hardcoded-magic-1024 (2014-07-17) 1 commit
 - abspath.c: use PATH_MAX in real_path_internal()

 Still being discussed.


* sk/mingw-uni-fix-more (2014-07-21) 14 commits
 - Win32: enable color output in Windows cmd.exe
 - Win32: patch Windows environment on startup
 - Win32: keep the environment sorted
 - Win32: use low-level memory allocation during initialization
 - Win32: reduce environment array reallocations
 - Win32: don't copy the environment twice when spawning child processes
 - Win32: factor out environment block creation

 - Win32: unify environment case-sensitivity
 - Win32: fix environment memory leaks
 - Win32: Unicode environment (incoming)
 - Win32: Unicode environment (outgoing)
 - Revert "Windows: teach getenv to do a case-sensitive search"
 - tests: do not pass iso8859-1 encoded parameter

 Most of these are battle-tested in msysgit and are needed to
 complete what has been merged to 'master' already.

 A fix has been squashed into "Unicode environ (outgoing)"; is this
 now ready to go?


* sk/mingw-tests-workaround (2014-07-21) 6 commits
 - t800[12]: work around MSys limitation
 - t9902: mingw-specific fix for gitfile link files
 - t4210: skip command-line encoding tests on mingw
 - MinGW: disable legacy encoding tests
 - t0110/MinGW: skip tests that pass arbitrary bytes on the command line
 - MinGW: Skip test redirecting to fd 4
 (this branch is used by jc/not-mingw-cygwin.)

 Make tests pass on msysgit by mostly disabling ones that are
 infeasible on that platform.

 The t0110 one has been replaced; is this now ready to go?


* ta/string-list-init (2014-07-21) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-07-21 at 63e8891)
 + replace memset with string-list initializers
 + string-list: add string_list initializer helper function
 (this branch is tangled with ta/config-set.)

 Will merge to 'master'.


* cb/mergetool-difftool (2014-07-21) 2 commits
 - difftool: don't assume that default sh is sane
 - mergetool: don't require a work tree for --tool-help


* rs/fix-unlink-unix-socket (2014-07-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-07-22 at fad8c29)
 + unix-socket: remove stale socket before calling chdir()

 The unix-domain socket used by the sample credential cache daemon
 tried to unlink an existing stale one at a wrong path, if the path
 to the socket was given as an overlong path that does not fit in
 sun_path member of the sockaddr_un structure.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* rs/strbuf-getcwd (2014-07-21) 4 commits
 - use xgetcwd() get the current directory or die
 - wrapper: add xgetcwd()
 - use strbuf_getcwd() to get the current working directory without fixed-sized buffers

 Still being discussed.


* jc/not-mingw-cygwin (2014-07-21) 2 commits
 - test prerequisites: enumerate with commas
 - test prerequisites: eradicate NOT_FOO
 (this branch uses sk/mingw-tests-workaround.)

 We have been using NOT_{MINGW,CYGWIN} test prerequisites long
 before Peff invented support for negated prerequisites e.g. !MINGW
 and we still add more uses of the former.  Convert them to the
 latter to avoid confusion.


* jk/more-push-completion (2014-07-22) 3 commits
 - completion: complete `git push --force-with-lease=`
 - completion: add some missing options to `git push`
 - completion: complete "unstuck" `git push --recurse-submodules`

 Expecting a reroll to limit the damage to test_eval_; also reported
 to be broken with older zsh that are still in the field ($gmane/251231).


* ss/userdiff-update-csharp-java (2014-06-02) 2 commits
 - userdiff: support Java try keyword
 - userdiff: support C# async methods and correct C# keywords

 Reviews sent; waiting for a response.

 A new filter to programatically edit the tail end of the commit log
 messages.

 What is the status of this one?  I think I saw reviews by Michael
 but after that I do not recall seeing any updates.

 Ejected from 'pu' to unclutter.
 Expecting a reroll.


* bg/rebase-off-of-previous-branch (2014-04-16) 1 commit
 - git-rebase: print name of rev when using shorthand

 Teach "git rebase -" to report the concrete name of the branch
 (i.e. the previous one).

 But it stops short and does not do the same for "git rebase @{-1}".
 Expecting a reroll.


* tr/merge-recursive-index-only (2014-02-05) 3 commits
 - merge-recursive: -Xindex-only to leave worktree unchanged
 - merge-recursive: internal flag to avoid touching the worktree
 - merge-recursive: remove dead conditional in update_stages()

 . log --remerge-diff: show what the conflict resolution changed
 . name-hash: allow dir hashing even when !ignore_case
 . merge-recursive: allow storing conflict hunks in index
 . revision: fold all merge diff variants into an enum merge_diff_mode
 . combine-diff: do not pass revs->dense_combined_merges redundantly
 (this branch uses tr/merge-recursive-index-only.)

 "log -p" output learns a new way to let users inspect a merge
 commit by showing the differences between the automerged result
 with conflicts the person who recorded the merge would have seen
 and the final conflict resolution that was recorded in the merge.

 Needs to be rebased, now kb/fast-hashmap topic is in.


* jk/makefile (2014-02-05) 16 commits
 . FIXUP
 . move LESS/LV pager environment to Makefile
 . Makefile: teach scripts to include make variables

 . Makefile: introduce make-var helper function
 . Makefile: fix git-instaweb dependency on gitweb
 . Makefile: drop USE_GETTEXT_SCHEME from GIT-CFLAGS

 Simplify the Makefile rules and macros that exist primarily for
 quoting purposes, and make it easier to robustly express the
 dependency rules.

 Expecting a reroll.


* po/everyday-doc (2014-01-27) 1 commit
 - Make 'git help everyday' work

 This may make the said command to emit something, but the source is
 not meant to be formatted into a manual pages to begin with, and
 also its contents are a bit stale.  It may be a good first step in
 the right direction, but needs more work to at least get the
 mark-up right before public consumption.

 Will hold.


* rb/merge-prepare-commit-msg-hook (2014-01-10) 4 commits
 - merge: drop unused arg from abort_commit method signature
 - merge: make prepare_to_commit responsible for write_merge_state
 - t7505: ensure cleanup after hook blocks merge
 - t7505: add missing &&

 Expose more merge states (e.g. $GIT_DIR/MERGE_MODE) to hooks that
 run during "git merge".  The log message stresses too much on one
 hook, prepare-commit-msg, but it would equally apply to other hooks
 like post-merge, I think.

 Waiting for a reroll.


* jc/graph-post-root-gap (2013-12-30) 3 commits
 - WIP: document what we want at the end
 - graph: remove unused code a bit
 - graph: stuff the current commit into graph->columns[]

 This was primarily a RFH ($gmane/239580).


* tg/perf-lib-test-perf-cleanup (2013-09-19) 2 commits
 - perf-lib: add test_perf_cleanup target
 - perf-lib: split starting the test from the execution

 Add test_perf_cleanup shell function to the perf suite, that allows
 the script writers to define a test with a clean-up action.

 Will hold.

 - show-branch: use commit slab to represent bitflags of arbitrary width
 - show-branch.c: remove "all_mask"
 - show-branch.c: abstract out "flags" operation

 - show-branch.c: update comment style

 Waiting for the final step to lift the hard-limit before sending it out.


* jh/submodule-tests (2014-04-17) 1 commit
 - t7410: 210 tests for various 'git submodule update' scenarios

 More or less abandoned.  Will drop.

--------------------------------------------------

 "git rebase --fork-point" did not filter out patch-identical
 commits correctly.

  (merged to 'next' on 2014-07-21 at 8277dc9)
 + lockfile: allow reopening a closed but still locked file

 Needed in the "commit -p" code path to update the cache tree in the
 index.

* jc/test-lazy-prereq (2014-06-13) 1 commit
 - tests: drop GIT_*_TIMING_TESTS environment variable support

 Test-script clean-up.

 Will hold.


* mt/patch-id-stable (2014-06-10) 1 commit
 - patch-id: change default to stable

 Teaches "git patch-id" to compute the patch ID that does not change
 when the files in a single patch is reordered. As this new algorithm
 is backward incompatible, the last bit to flip it to be the default
 is left out of 'master' for now.

 Will hold.
