What's cooking in git.git (Oct 2019, #01; Thu, 3)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

I've been offline for a week or so, and have been trying to process
the backlog, but I am sure there are still things to be picked up.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* ag/sequencer-todo-updates (2019-10-02) 5 commits
 - sequencer: directly call pick_commits() from complete_action()
 - rebase: fill `squash_onto' in get_replay_opts()
 - sequencer: move the code writing total_nr on the disk to a new function
 - sequencer: update `done_nr' when skipping commands in a todo list
 - sequencer: update `total_nr' when adding an item to a todo list

 Expecting a reroll.
 cf. <nycvar.QRO.7.76.6.1910021018360.46@tvgsbejvaqbjf.bet> to clarify log messages.
 there may be others.


* ah/cleanups (2019-10-03) 4 commits
 - git_mkstemps_mode(): replace magic numbers with computed value
 - wrapper: use a loop instead of repetitive statements
 - diffcore-break: use a goto instead of a redundant if statement
 - commit-graph: remove a duplicate assignment

 Miscellaneous code clean-ups.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* as/shallow-slab-use-fix (2019-10-02) 1 commit
 - shallow.c: don't free unallocated slabs

 Correct code that tried to reference all entries in a sparse array
 of pointers by mistake.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* js/fetch-jobs (2019-10-02) 1 commit
 - fetch: let --jobs=<n> parallelize --multiple, too

 "git fetch --jobs=<n>" allowed <n> parallel jobs when fetching
 submodules, but this did not apply to "git fetch --multiple" that
 fetches from multiple remote repositories.  It now does.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* js/mingw-spawn-with-spaces-in-path (2019-10-02) 1 commit
 - t0061: fix test for argv[0] with spaces (MINGW only)

 Test fix.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* gs/commit-graph-trace-with-cmd (2019-10-02) 1 commit
 - commit-graph: emit trace2 cmd_mode for each sub-command

 Dev support.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* js/trace2-fetch-push (2019-10-03) 2 commits
 - push: add trace2 instrumentation
 - fetch: add trace2 instrumentation

 Dev support.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* js/range-diff-noprefix (2019-10-03) 1 commit
 - range-diff: internally force `diff.noprefix=true`

 "git range-diff" segfaulted when diff.noprefix configuration was
 used, as it blindly expected the patch it internally generates to
 have the standard a/ and b/ prefixes.  The command now forces the
 internal patch to be built without any prefix, not to be affected
 by any end-user configuration.

 Will merge to 'next'.

* ar/mingw-run-external-with-non-ascii-path (2019-08-26) 1 commit

 + t3305: make hash size independent
 + t3301: abstract away SHA-1-specific constants
 + t3206: abstract away hash size constants
 + t3201: abstract away SHA-1-specific constants

 Preparation for SHA-256 upgrade continues in the test department.


* bw/rebase-autostash-keep-current-branch (2019-09-07) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-09-18 at 6d8ed846ed)
 + builtin/rebase.c: Remove pointless message
 + builtin/rebase.c: make sure the active branch isn't moved when autostashing

 "git rebase --autostash <upstream> <branch>", when <branch> is
 different from the current branch, incorrectly moved the tip of the
 current branch, which has been corrected.


* dl/compat-cleanup (2019-09-05) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-09-09 at e33c896e16)
 + compat/*.[ch]: remove extern from function declarations using spatch
 + mingw: apply array.cocci rule
 (this branch is used by dl/cocci-everywhere.)

 Code cleanup.


* dl/complete-cherry-pick-revert-skip (2019-08-27) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-09-18 at 7dd173f824)
 + status: mention --skip for revert and cherry-pick
 + completion: add --skip for cherry-pick and revert
 + completion: merge options for cherry-pick and revert

 The command line completion support (in contrib/) learned about the
 "--skip" option of "git revert" and "git cherry-pick".


* dl/format-patch-doc-test-cleanup (2019-09-05) 13 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-09-09 at b3022b4002)
 + config/format.txt: specify default value of format.coverLetter
 + Doc: add more detail for git-format-patch
 + t4014: stop losing return codes of git commands
 + t4014: remove confusing pipe in check_threading()
 + t4014: use test_line_count() where possible
 + t4014: let sed open its own files
 + t4014: drop redirections to /dev/null
 + t4014: use indentable here-docs
 + t4014: remove spaces after redirect operators
 + t4014: use sq for test case names
 + t4014: move closing sq onto its own line
 + t4014: s/expected/expect/
 + t4014: drop unnecessary blank lines from test cases
 (this branch is used by dl/format-patch-cover-letter-subject.)

 The documentation and tests for "git format-patch" have been
 cleaned up.


* dl/rebase-i-keep-base (2019-08-27) 9 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-09-18 at f94f486724)
 + rebase: teach rebase --keep-base
 + rebase tests: test linear branch topology
 + rebase: fast-forward --fork-point in more cases
 + rebase: fast-forward --onto in more cases
 + rebase: refactor can_fast_forward into goto tower
 + t3432: test for --no-ff's interaction with fast-forward
 + t3432: distinguish "noop-same" v.s. "work-same" in "same head" tests
 + t3432: test rebase fast-forward behavior
 + t3431: add rebase --fork-point tests

 "git rebase --keep-base <upstream>" tries to find the original base
 of the topic being rebased and rebase on top of that same base,
 which is useful when running the "git rebase -i" (and its limited
 variant "git rebase -x").

 The command also has learned to fast-forward in more cases where it
 can instead of replaying to recreate identical commits.


* dl/use-sq-from-test-lib (2019-09-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-09-09 at 9a6619ddab)
 + t: use common $SQ variable

 Code cleanup.


* ds/commit-graph-on-fetch (2019-09-03) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-09-18 at 10702dd989)

 A configuration variable tells "git fetch" to write the commit
 graph after finishing.


* ds/include-exclude (2019-09-05) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-09-18 at 1a3655a089)
 + unpack-trees: rename 'is_excluded_from_list()'
 + treewide: rename 'exclude' methods to 'pattern'
 + treewide: rename 'EXCL_FLAG_' to 'PATTERN_FLAG_'
 + treewide: rename 'struct exclude_list' to 'struct pattern_list'
 + treewide: rename 'struct exclude' to 'struct path_pattern'

 The internal code originally invented for ".gitignore" processing
 got reshuffled and renamed to make it less tied to "excluding" and
 stress more that it is about "matching", as it has been reused for
 things like sparse checkout specification that want to check if a
 path is "included".


* dt/remote-helper-doc-re-lock-option (2019-08-30) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-09-09 at 970488992a)

 + Recommend git-filter-repo instead of git-filter-branch
 + t6006: simplify, fix, and optimize empty message test

 Start discouraging the use of "git filter-branch".

 + trace2: trim trailing whitespace in normal format error message
 + trace2: remove dead code in maybe_add_string_va()
 + trace2: trim whitespace in region messages in perf target format
 + trace2: cleanup column alignment in perf target format

 Output from trace2 subsystem is formatted more prettily now.


* jk/fast-import-history-bugfix (2019-08-27) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-09-09 at eeef864077)

 On Windows, the root level of UNC share is now allowed to be used
 just like any other directory.


* js/visual-studio (2019-09-05) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-09-09 at 5493ee9474)

 been forbidden when the target remote repository is set to be a
 mirror.

* cb/pcre2-chartables-leakfix (2019-08-06) 3 commits
 - grep: avoid leak of chartables in PCRE2
 - grep: make PCRE2 aware of custom allocator
 - grep: make PCRE1 aware of custom allocator

 WIP (this is v3 which is rather old, where the last message in the
 discussion talks about v6 that has never been sent to the list).

* es/walken-tutorial (2019-08-07) 1 commit
 - documentation: add tutorial for revision walking

 A tutorial on object enumeration.

 Perhaps take the thing with as little tweaks as possible, retitling
 it to "my first object enumeration" or something?
 cf. <20190814183328.GA40797@google.com>


* dl/format-patch-cover-letter-subject (2019-09-05) 1 commit
 - format-patch: learn --infer-cover-subject option

 "git format-patch --cover-letter" learned to optionally use the
 first paragraph (typically a single-liner) of branch.*.description
 as the subject of the cover letter.

 Reroll with a redesign with less emphasis on "subject" coming?


* jn/unknown-index-extensions (2018-11-21) 2 commits
 - index: offer advice for unknown index extensions
 - index: do not warn about unrecognized extensions

 A bit too alarming warning given when unknown index extensions
 exist is getting revamped.

 Expecting a reroll.


* jc/format-patch-delay-message-id (2019-04-05) 1 commit
 - format-patch: move message-id and related headers to the end

 The location "git format-patch --thread" adds the Message-Id:
 header in the series of header fields has been moved down, which
 may help working around a suspected bug in GMail MSA, reported at
 <CAHk-=whP1stFZNAaJiMi5eZ9rj0MRt20Y_yHVczZPH+O01d+sA@mail.gmail.com>

 Waiting for feedback to see if it truly helps.
 Needs tests.


* jt/fetch-cdn-offload (2019-03-12) 9 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - upload-pack: send part of packfile response as uri
 - fetch-pack: support more than one pack lockfile
 - upload-pack: refactor reading of pack-objects out

 the pack contents to be instead taken from elsewhere (aka CDN).


* js/protocol-advertise-multi (2018-12-28) 1 commit
 - protocol: advertise multiple supported versions

 The transport layer has been updated so that the protocol version
 used can be negotiated between the parties, by the initiator
 listing the protocol versions it is willing to talk, and the other
 side choosing from one of them.

 Expecting a reroll.

* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2018-10-15) 1 commit
 - zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

* mt/threaded-grep-in-object-store (2019-10-02) 11 commits
 - grep: move driver pre-load out of critical section
 - grep: re-enable threads in non-worktree case
 - grep: protect packed_git [re-]initialization
 - grep: allow submodule functions to run in parallel
 - submodule-config: add skip_if_read option to repo_read_gitmodules()

 - replace-object: make replace operations thread-safe
 - grep: fix racy calls in grep_objects()
 - grep: fix race conditions at grep_submodule()
 - grep: fix race conditions on userdiff calls

 Traditionally, we avoided threaded grep while searching in objects
 (as opposed to files in the working tree) as accesses to the object
 layer is not thread-safe.  This limitation is getting lifted.

  (merged to 'next' on 2019-09-30 at a5d6788e2e)

* js/diff-rename-force-stable-sort (2019-10-02) 2 commits
 - diffcore_rename(): use a stable sort
 - Move git_sort(), a stable sort, into into libgit.a

 The rename detection logic sorts a list of rename source candidates
 by similarity to pick the best candidate, which means that a tie
 between sources with the same similarity is broken by the original
 location in the original canidate list (which is sorted by path).
 Force the sorting by similarity done with a stable sort, which is
 not promised by system supplied qsort(3), to ensure consistent
 results across platforms.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ma/user-manual-markup-update (2019-09-28) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-09-30 at 822fa2ed99)
