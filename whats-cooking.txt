What's cooking in git.git (Dec 2018, #02; Fri, 28)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

The current state is that 'next' has been rewound, a few topics have
been updated, and almost no new topics have been picked up (yet),
even though many of them seem to have been reviewed on-list and I've
also looked at some of them.

Sorry for being slow to recover from the year-end slowness; the 2.20
release being rather large-ish and needed brown-paper-bag fixes soon
after it, my temporary trans-pacific migration, or me catching cold
that I haven't shaken off, did not help X-<.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

* hn/highlight-sideband-keywords (2018-12-04) 1 commit
 - sideband: color lines with keyword only

 Lines that begin with a certain keyword that come over the wire, as
 well as lines that consist only of one of these keywords, ought to
 be painted in color for easier eyeballing, but the latter was
 broken ever since the feature was introduced in 2.19, which has
 been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* js/commit-graph-chunk-table-fix (2018-12-14) 3 commits
 - Makefile: correct example fuzz build
 - commit-graph: fix buffer read-overflow

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2018-11-29

 The http-backend CGI process did not correctly clean up the child
 processes it spawns to run upload-pack etc. when it dies itself,
 which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* tb/log-G-binary (2018-12-26) 1 commit
 - log -G: ignore binary files

 "git log -G<regex>" looked for a hunk in the "git log -p" patch
 output that contained a string that matches the given pattern.
 Optimize this code to ignore binary files, which by default will
 not show any hunk that would match any pattern (unless textconv or
 the --text option is in effect, that is).

 Will merge to 'next'.


* dl/merge-cleanup-scissors-fix (2018-11-21) 2 commits
 - merge: add scissors line on merge conflict
 - t7600: clean up 'merge --squash c3 with c7' test

 The list of conflicted paths shown in the editor while concluding a
 conflicted merge was shown above the scissors line when the
 clean-up mode is set to "scissors", even though it was commented
 out just like the list of updated paths and other information to
 help the user explain the merge better.

 Kicked out of 'next', to replace with a newer iteration.

 - pretty: allow showing specific trailers
 - pretty: single return path in %(trailers) handling
 - pretty: allow %(trailers) options with explicit value
 - doc: group pretty-format.txt placeholders descriptions

 The %(trailers) formatter in "git log --format=..."  now allows to
 optionally pick trailers selectively by keyword, show only values,
 etc.

 How's the doneness of this one?


* nd/attr-pathspec-in-tree-walk (2018-11-19) 5 commits
 - tree-walk: support :(attr) matching
 - dir.c: move, rename and export match_attrs()
 - pathspec.h: clean up "extern" in function declarations
 - tree-walk.c: make tree_entry_interesting() take an index
 - tree.c: make read_tree*() take 'struct repository *'

 The traversal over tree objects has learned to honor
 ":(attr:label)" pathspec match, which has been implemented only for
 enumerating paths on the filesystem.

 A bit too alarming warning given when unknown index extensions
 exist is getting revamped.

 Expecting a reroll.


* en/fast-export-import (2018-11-17) 11 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-12-28 at a1b09cf515)

* nd/checkout-dwim-fix (2018-11-14) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-12-28 at 3183c9305b)
 + checkout: disambiguate dwim tracking branches and local files

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2018-11-18

 "git checkout frotz" (without any double-dash) avoids ambiguity by
 making sure 'frotz' cannot be interpreted as a revision and as a
 path at the same time.  This safety has been updated to check also
 a unique remote-tracking branch 'frotz' in a remote, when dwimming
 to create a local branch 'frotz' out of a remote-tracking branch
 'frotz' from a remote.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* nd/checkout-noisy (2018-11-20) 2 commits
 - t0027: squelch checkout path run outside test_expect_* block
 - checkout: print something when checking out paths

 "git checkout [<tree-ish>] path..." learned to report the number of
 paths that have been checked out of the index or the tree-ish,
 which gives it the same degree of noisy-ness as the case in which
 the command checks out a branch.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sg/clone-initial-fetch-configuration (2018-11-16) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-12-28 at 82e104f221)
 + Documentation/clone: document ignored configuration variables
 + clone: respect additional configured fetch refspecs during initial fetch
 + clone: use a more appropriate variable name for the default refspec

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2018-11-18

 Refspecs configured with "git -c var=val clone" did not propagate
 to the resulting repository, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* en/rebase-merge-on-sequencer (2018-11-08) 2 commits
 - rebase: implement --merge via git-rebase--interactive
 - git-rebase, sequencer: extend --quiet option for the interactive machinery

 "git rebase --merge" as been reimplemented by reusing the internal
 machinery used for "git rebase -i".

 Expecting a reroll.

* fc/http-version (2018-11-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-12-28 at 56bcbb0fa9)
 + http: add support selecting http version

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2018-11-18

 The "http.version" configuration variable can be used with recent
 enough cURL library to force the version of HTTP used to talk when
 fetching and pushing.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* dl/remote-save-to-push (2018-12-11) 1 commit
 - remote: add --save-to-push option to git remote set-url

 "git remote set-url" learned a new option that moves existing value
 of the URL field to pushURL field of the remote before replacing
 the URL field with a new value.

 I am personally not yet quite convinced if this is worth pursuing.


* jk/loose-object-cache (2018-11-24) 10 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-12-28 at 5a5faf384e)
 + odb_load_loose_cache: fix strbuf leak
 + fetch-pack: drop custom loose object cache
 + sha1-file: use loose object cache for quick existence check
 + object-store: provide helpers for loose_objects_cache
 + sha1-file: use an object_directory for the main object dir
 + handle alternates paths the same as the main object dir
 + sha1_file_name(): overwrite buffer instead of appending
 + rename "alternate_object_database" to "object_directory"
 + submodule--helper: prefer strip_suffix() to ends_with()
 + fsck: do not reuse child_process structs

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2018-11-24

 Code clean-up with optimization for the codepath that checks
 (non-)existence of loose objects.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* js/protocol-advertise-multi (2018-11-17) 1 commit
 - protocol: advertise multiple supported versions

 The transport layer has been updated so that the protocol version
 used can be negotiated between the parties, by the initiator
 listing the protocol versions it is willing to talk, and the other
 side choosing from one of them.

 Expecting a reroll.
 cf. <20181218230514.GH37614@google.com>


* js/smart-http-detect-remote-error (2018-12-12) 4 commits
 - lib-httpd, t5551: check server-side HTTP errors
 - remote-curl: tighten "version 2" check for smart-http
 - remote-curl: refactor smart-http discovery

 Some errors from the other side coming over smart HTTP transport
 were not noticed, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* nb/branch-show-other-worktrees-head (2018-11-12) 2 commits
 - branch: mark and colorize a branch differently if it is checked out in a linked worktree
 - ref-filter: add worktree atom

 "git branch --list" learned to show branches that are checked out
 in other worktrees connected to the same repository prefixed with
 '+', similar to the way the currently checked out branch is shown
 with '*' in front.

 Expecting a reroll.


* nd/the-index (2018-11-12) 22 commits

* ab/push-dwim-dst (2018-11-14) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-12-28 at d9f618de10)
 + push doc: document the DWYM behavior pushing to unqualified <dst>
 + push: test that <src> doesn't DWYM if <dst> is unqualified
 + push: add an advice on unqualified <dst> push
 + push: move unqualified refname error into a function
 + push: improve the error shown on unqualified <dst> push
 + i18n: remote.c: mark error(...) messages for translation
 + remote.c: add braces in anticipation of a follow-up change

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2018-11-18

 "git push $there $src:$dst" rejects when $dst is not a fully
 qualified refname and not clear what the end user meant.  The
 codepath has been taught to give a clearer error message, and also
 guess where the push should go by taking the type of the pushed
 object into account (e.g. a tag object would want to go under
 refs/tags/).

* md/list-lazy-objects-fix (2018-12-06) 1 commit
 - list-objects.c: don't segfault for missing cmdline objects

 + stash: tolerate missing user identity

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2018-11-19

 A properly configured username/email is required under
 user.useConfigOnly in order to create commits; now "git stash"
 (even though it creates commit objects to represent stash entries)
 command is excempt from the requirement.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* bc/sha-256 (2018-11-14) 12 commits
 - hash: add an SHA-256 implementation using OpenSSL
 - sha256: add an SHA-256 implementation using libgcrypt
 - Add a base implementation of SHA-256 support
 - commit-graph: convert to using the_hash_algo
 - t/helper: add a test helper to compute hash speed
 - sha1-file: add a constant for hash block size
 - t: make the sha1 test-tool helper generic
 - t: add basic tests for our SHA-1 implementation
 - cache: make hashcmp and hasheq work with larger hashes
 - hex: introduce functions to print arbitrary hashes
 - sha1-file: provide functions to look up hash algorithms
 - sha1-file: rename algorithm to "sha1"

 Add sha-256 hash and plug it through the code to allow building Git
 with the "NewHash".


* js/vsts-ci (2018-10-16) 13 commits
 . travis: fix skipping tagged releases
 . README: add a build badge (status of the Azure Pipelines build)
 . tests: record more stderr with --write-junit-xml in case of failure
 . tests: include detailed trace logs with --write-junit-xml upon failure
 . git-p4: use `test_atexit` to kill the daemon
 . git-daemon: use `test_atexit` in the tests
 . tests: introduce `test_atexit`
 . ci: add a build definition for Azure DevOps
 . ci/lib.sh: add support for Azure Pipelines
 . tests: optionally write results as JUnit-style .xml
 . test-date: add a subcommand to measure times in shell scripts
 . ci/lib.sh: encapsulate Travis-specific things
 . ci: rename the library of common functions

 Prepare to run test suite on Azure DevOps.

 Ejected out of 'pu', as doing so seems to help other topics get
 tested at TravisCI.

 https://travis-ci.org/git/git/builds/452713184 is a sample of a
 build whose tests on 4 hang (with this series in).  Ejecting it
 gave us https://travis-ci.org/git/git/builds/452778963 which still
 shows breakages from other topics not yet in 'next', but at least
 the tests do not stall.


* du/branch-show-current (2018-10-26) 1 commit
 - branch: introduce --show-current display option

 "git branch" learned a new subcommand "--show-current".

 I am personally not yet quite convinced if this is worth pursuing.


* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2018-10-15) 1 commit
 - zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".


* ag/sequencer-reduce-rewriting-todo (2018-11-12) 16 commits
 . rebase--interactive: move transform_todo_file() to rebase--interactive.c
 . sequencer: fix a call to error() in transform_todo_file()
 . sequencer: use edit_todo_list() in complete_action()
 . rebase-interactive: rewrite edit_todo_list() to handle the initial edit
 . rebase-interactive: append_todo_help() changes
 . rebase-interactive: use todo_list_write_to_file() in edit_todo_list()
 . sequencer: refactor skip_unnecessary_picks() to work on a todo_list
 . sequencer: change complete_action() to use the refactored functions
 . sequencer: make sequencer_make_script() write its script to a strbuf
 . sequencer: refactor rearrange_squash() to work on a todo_list
 . sequencer: refactor sequencer_add_exec_commands() to work on a todo_list
 . sequencer: refactor check_todo_list() to work on a todo_list
 . sequencer: introduce todo_list_write_to_file()
 . sequencer: refactor transform_todos() to work on a todo_list
 . sequencer: make the todo_list structure public
 . sequencer: changes in parse_insn_buffer()

 The scripted version of "git rebase -i" wrote and rewrote the todo
 list many times during a single step of its operation, and the
 recent C-rewrite made a faithful conversion of the logic to C.  The
 implementation has been updated to carry necessary information
 around in-core to avoid rewriting the same file over and over
 unnecessarily.

 With too many topics in-flight that touch sequencer and rebaser,
 this need to wait giving precedence to other topics that fix bugs.


* sb/submodule-recursive-fetch-gets-the-tip (2018-12-09) 9 commits
 - fetch: ensure submodule objects fetched
 - submodule.c: fetch in submodules git directory instead of in worktree
 - submodule: migrate get_next_submodule to use repository structs
 - repository: repo_submodule_init to take a submodule struct
 - submodule: store OIDs in changed_submodule_names
 - submodule.c: tighten scope of changed_submodule_names struct
 - submodule.c: sort changed_submodule_names before searching it
 - submodule.c: fix indentation
 - sha1-array: provide oid_array_filter

 "git fetch --recurse-submodules" may not fetch the necessary commit
 that is bound to the superproject, which is getting corrected.

 Ready?


* js/add-i-coalesce-after-editing-hunk (2018-08-28) 1 commit
 - add -p: coalesce hunks before testing applicability

 Applicability check after a patch is edited in a "git add -i/p"
 session has been improved.

 Will hold.

 "git stash" rewritten in C.

 Expecting a reroll, probably on top of the sd/stash-wo-user-name
 topic after it stabilizes, with an escape hatch like the one in
 "rebase in C".


* pw/add-p-select (2018-07-26) 4 commits
 - add -p: optimize line selection for short hunks
 - add -p: allow line selection to be inverted
 - add -p: select modified lines correctly
 - add -p: select individual hunk lines

 "git add -p" interactive interface learned to let users choose
 individual added/removed lines to be used in the operation, instead
 of accepting or rejecting a whole hunk.

 Will discard.
 No further feedbacks on the topic for quite some time.

 cf. <d622a95b-7302-43d4-4ec9-b2cf3388c653@talktalk.net>
 I found the feature to be hard to explain, and may result in more
 end-user complaints, but let's see.

--------------------------------------------------
[Discarded]

* ab/reject-alias-loop (2018-10-19) 1 commit
 . alias: detect loops in mixed execution mode

 Two (or more) aliases that mutually refer to each other can form an
 infinite loop; we now attempt to notice and stop.

 Discarded.
 Reverted out of 'next'.

 . bundle: rollback lock file while refusing to create an empty bundle

* js/remote-archive-v2 (2018-09-28) 4 commits
 . archive: allow archive over HTTP(S) with proto v2
 . archive: implement protocol v2 archive command
 . archive: use packet_reader for communications
 . archive: follow test standards around assertions

 The original implementation of "git archive --remote" more or less
 bypassed the transport layer and did not work over http(s).  The
 version 2 of the protocol is defined to allow going over http(s) as
 well as Git native transport.

 Retracted; reverted out of next.

* ab/format-patch-rangediff-not-stat (2018-11-24) 1 commit
 . format-patch: don't include --stat with --range-diff output

 The "--rangediff" option recently added to "format-patch"
 interspersed a bogus and useless "--stat" information by mistake,
 which is being corrected.

 Reverted out of 'next'.


* jc/postpone-rebase-in-c (2018-11-26) 1 commit
 . rebase: mark the C reimplementation as an experimental opt-in feature

 People seem to be still finding latent bugs in the "rebase in C"
 reimplementation.  For the upcoming release, use the scripted
 version by default and adjust the documentation accordingly.

 Reverted out of 'next'.
