What's cooking in git.git (Apr 2017, #03; Tue, 18)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* df/dir-iter-remove-subtree (2017-04-17) 5 commits
 - remove_subtree(): reimplement using iterators
 - dir_iterator: refactor state machine model
 - dir_iterator: add helpers to dir_iterator_advance
 - remove_subtree(): test removing nested directories
 - dir_iterator: add tests for dir_iterator API

 Update the dir-iterator API and use it to reimplement
 remove_subtree().

 Waiting for response to review.

* jk/ls-files-recurse-submodules-fix (2017-04-18) 2 commits
 - ls-files: fix path used when recursing into submodules
 - ls-files: fix recurse-submodules with nested submodules

 "ls-files --recurse-submodules" did not quite work well in a
 project with nested submodules.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jt/fetch-pack-error-reporting (2017-04-17) 1 commit
 - fetch-pack: show clearer error message upon ERR

 "git fetch-pack" was not prepared to accept ERR packet that the
 upload-pack can send with a human-readable error message.  It
 showed the packet contents with ERR prefix, so there was no data
 loss, but it was redundant to say "ERR" in an error message.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* nd/conditional-config-in-early-config (2017-04-17) 3 commits
 - config: correct file reading order in read_early_config()
 - config: handle conditional include when $GIT_DIR is not set up
 - config: prepare to pass more info in git_config_with_options()

 The recently introduced conditional inclusion of configuration did
 not work well when early-config mechanism was involved.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 subsequent fetches.


* ab/completion-push-delete-ref (2017-04-18) 1 commit
 - completion: expand "push --delete <remote> <ref>" for refs on that <remote>

 The completion script (in contrib/) learned to complete "git push
 --delete b<TAB>" to complete branch name to be deleted.

* sh/grep-tree-obj-tweak-output (2017-01-20) 2 commits
 - grep: use '/' delimiter for paths
 - grep: only add delimiter if there isn't one already

 "git grep", when fed a tree-ish as an input, shows each hit
 prefixed with "<tree-ish>:<path>:<lineno>:".  As <tree-ish> is
 almost always either a commit or a tag that points at a commit, the
 early part of the output "<tree-ish>:<path>" can be used as the
 name of the blob and given to "git show".  When <tree-ish> is a
 tree given in the extended SHA-1 syntax (e.g. "<commit>:", or
 "<commit>:<dir>"), however, this results in a string that does not
 name a blob (e.g. "<commit>::<path>" or "<commit>:<dir>:<path>").
 "git grep" has been taught to be a bit more intelligent about these
 cases and omit a colon (in the former case) or use slash (in the
 latter case) to produce "<commit>:<path>" and
 "<commit>:<dir>/<path>" that can be used as the name of a blob.

 Expecting a reroll?  Is this good enough with known limitations?


* jc/diff-b-m (2015-02-23) 5 commits
 . WIPWIP
 . WIP: diff-b-m
 - diffcore-rename: allow easier debugging
 - diffcore-rename.c: add locate_rename_src()
 - diffcore-break: allow debugging

 "git diff -B -M" produced incorrect patch when the postimage of a
 completely rewritten file is similar to the preimage of a removed
 file; such a resulting file must not be expressed as a rename from
 other place.

 The fix in this patch is broken, unfortunately.

 Will discard.

* ah/diff-files-ours-theirs-doc (2017-04-13) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-04-18 at a4f80f0c3f)
 + diff-files: document --ours etc.

 The diff options "--ours", "--theirs" exist for quite some time.
 But so far they were not documented. Now they are.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* dt/xgethostname-nul-termination (2017-04-18) 2 commits
 - xgethostname: handle long hostnames
 - use HOST_NAME_MAX to size buffers for gethostname(2)

 gethostname(2) may not NUL terminate the buffer if hostname does
 not fit; unfortunately there is no easy way to see if our buffer
 was too small, but at least this will make sure we will not end up
 using garbage past the end of the buffer.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jh/string-list-micro-optim (2017-04-15) 1 commit
 - string-list: use ALLOC_GROW macro when reallocing string_list

 The string-list API used a custom reallocation strategy that was
 very inefficient, instead of using the usual ALLOC_GROW() macro,
 which has been fixed.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jh/unpack-trees-micro-optim (2017-04-15) 1 commit
 - unpack-trees: avoid duplicate ODB lookups during checkout

 In a 2- and 3-way merge of trees, more than one source trees often
 end up sharing an identical subtree; optimize by not reading the
 same tree multiple times in such a case.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jh/verify-index-checksum-only-in-fsck (2017-04-15) 1 commit
 - read-cache: force_verify_index_checksum

 The index file has a trailing SHA-1 checksum to detect file
 corruption, and historically we checked it every time the index
 file is used.  Omit the validation during normal use, and instead
 verify only in "git fsck".

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/no-looking-at-dotgit-outside-repo (2017-04-16) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-04-18 at 68260787ad)
 + test-read-cache: setup git dir
 + has_sha1_file: don't bother if we are not in a repository

 Clean up fallouts from recent tightening of the set-up sequence,
 where Git barfs when repository information is accessed without
 first ensuring that it was started in a repository.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ls/travis-doc-asciidoctor (2017-04-16) 3 commits
 - travis-ci: unset compiler for jobs that do not need one

 AsciiDoctor.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* mg/status-in-progress-info (2017-04-14) 1 commit
 - status: show in-progress info for short status

 "git status" learns an option to report various operations
 (e.g. "merging") that the user is in the middle of.


* nd/conditional-config-include (2017-04-14) 2 commits
 - config: resolve symlinks in conditional include's patterns
 - path.c: and an option to call real_path() in expand_user_path()

 $GIT_DIR may in some cases be normalized with all symlinks resolved
 while "gitdir" path expansion in the pattern does not receive the
 same treatment, leading to incorrect mismatch.  This has been fixed.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* nd/worktree-add-lock (2017-04-16) 2 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - worktree add: add --lock option

 Allow to lock a worktree immediately after it's created. This helps
 prevent a race between "git worktree add; git worktree lock" and
 "git worktree prune".

 Waiting for a response to SQUASH???


* ps/pathspec-empty-prefix-origin (2017-04-14) 1 commit

 "git checkout" that handles a lot of paths has been optimized by
 reducing the number of unnecessary checks of paths in the
 has_dir_name() function.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 + git-p4: don't use name-rev to get current branch
 + git-p4: add read_pipe_text() internal function

* pc/t2027-git-to-pipe-cleanup (2017-04-14) 1 commit
 - t2027: avoid using pipes

 Having a git command on the upstream side of a pipe in a test
 script will hide the exit status from the command, which may cause
 us to fail to notice a breakage; rewrite tests in a script to avoid
 this issue.


* lt/mailinfo-in-body-header-continuation (2017-04-11) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-04-16 at b2f51f0780)
 + mailinfo: fix in-body header continuations

 If a patch e-mail had its first paragraph after an in-body header
 indented (even after a blank line after the in-body header line),
 the indented line was mistook as a continuation of the in-body
 header.  This has been fixed.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* bp/sub-process-convert-filter (2017-03-30) 8 commits
 - convert: update subprocess_read_status to not die on EOF

 - convert: separate generic structures and variables from the filter specific ones
 - convert: split start_multi_file_filter() into two separate functions
 - convert: move packet_write_list() into pkt-line.c as packet_writel()
 - pkt-line: add packet_read_line_gently()

 Code from "conversion using external process" codepath has been
 extracted to a separate sub-process.[ch] module.

 Reroll exists but needs more work.

* cc/split-index-config (2017-03-30) 1 commit
 - read-cache: avoid using git_path() in freshen_shared_index()

 The split-index code configuration code used an unsafe git_path()
 function without copying its result out.

 Needs to be explained better.
 The code looked OK, though.


* mg/name-rev-debug (2017-03-31) 4 commits
 - describe: pass --debug down to name-rev
 - name-rev: provide debug output
 - name-rev: favor describing with tags and use committer date to tiebreak
 - name-rev: refactor logic to see if a new candidate is a better name

 "git describe --debug --contains" did not add any meaningful
 information, even though without "--contains" it did.

 Expecting a reroll of the tip two.

* sb/submodule-short-status (2017-03-29) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-04-16 at 24e18f4a4a)
 + submodule.c: correctly handle nested submodules in is_submodule_modified
 + short status: improve reporting for submodule changes
 + submodule.c: stricter checking for submodules in is_submodule_modified
 + submodule.c: port is_submodule_modified to use porcelain 2
 + submodule.c: convert is_submodule_modified to use strbuf_getwholeline
 + submodule.c: factor out early loop termination in is_submodule_modified
 + submodule.c: use argv_array in is_submodule_modified

 The output from "git status --short" has been extended to show
 various kinds of dirtyness in submodules differently; instead of to
 "M" for modified, 'm' and '?' can be shown to signal changes only
 to the working tree of the submodule but not the commit that is
 checked out.

 - get_loose_ref_dir(): function renamed from get_loose_refs()
 - do_for_each_entry_in_dir(): eliminate `offset` argument
 - refs: handle "refs/bisect/" in `loose_fill_ref_dir()`
 - ref-cache: use a callback function to fill the cache
 - refs: record the ref_store in ref_cache, not ref_dir
 - ref-cache: introduce a new type, ref_cache
 - refs: split `ref_cache` code into separate files
 - ref-cache: rename `remove_entry()` to `remove_entry_from_dir()`
 - ref-cache: rename `find_ref()` to `find_ref_entry()`
 - ref-cache: rename `add_ref()` to `add_ref_entry()`
 - refs_verify_refname_available(): use function in more places
 - refs_verify_refname_available(): implement once for all backends
 - refs_ref_iterator_begin(): new function
 - refs_read_raw_ref(): new function
 - get_ref_dir(): don't call read_loose_refs() for "refs/bisect"
 (this branch uses nd/files-backend-git-dir; is tangled with nd/prune-in-worktree and nd/worktree-kill-parse-ref.)

 The internals of the refs API around the cached refs has been
 streamlined.

 Waiting for nd/files-backend-git-dir to settle.


* ja/doc-l10n (2017-03-20) 3 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - l10n: add git-add.txt to localized man pages
 - l10n: introduce framework for localizing man pages

 A proposal to use po4a to localize our manual pages.


* nd/prune-in-worktree (2017-04-16) 12 commits
 - rev-list: expose and document --single-worktree
 - revision.c: --reflog add HEAD reflog from all worktrees
 - files-backend: make reflog iterator go through per-worktree reflog
 - revision.c: --all adds HEAD from all worktrees
 - refs: remove dead for_each_*_submodule()
 - revision.c: use refs_for_each*() instead of for_each_*_submodule()
 - refs: add refs_head_ref()
 - refs: move submodule slash stripping code to get_submodule_ref_store
 - refs.c: refactor get_submodule_ref_store(), share common free block
 - revision.c: --indexed-objects add objects from all worktrees
 - revision.c: refactor add_index_objects_to_pending()
 - revision.h: new flag in struct rev_info wrt. worktree-related refs
 (this branch uses nd/files-backend-git-dir and nd/worktree-kill-parse-ref; is tangled with mh/separate-ref-cache.)

 "git gc" and friends when multiple worktrees are used off of a
 single repository did not consider the index and per-worktree refs
 of other worktrees as the root for reachability traversal, making
 objects that are in use only in other worktrees to be subject to
 garbage collection.

 Waiting for nd/files-backend-git-dir to settle.


* nd/worktree-kill-parse-ref (2017-04-16) 5 commits
 - refs: kill set_worktree_head_symref()
 - worktree.c: kill parse_ref() in favor of refs_resolve_ref_unsafe()
 - refs: introduce get_worktree_ref_store()
 - refs.c: make submodule ref store hashmap generic
 - environment.c: fix potential segfault by get_git_common_dir()
 (this branch is used by nd/prune-in-worktree; uses nd/files-backend-git-dir; is tangled with mh/separate-ref-cache.)

 (hopefully) a beginning of safer "git worktree" that is resistant
 to "gc".

 Waiting for nd/files-backend-git-dir to settle.

 (this branch is used by mh/separate-ref-cache, nd/prune-in-worktree and nd/worktree-kill-parse-ref.)

 The "submodule" specific field in the ref_store structure is
 replaced with a more generic "gitdir" that can later be used also
 when dealing with ref_store that represents the set of refs visible
 from the other worktrees.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/bundle (2016-03-03) 6 commits
 - index-pack: --clone-bundle option
 - Merge branch 'jc/index-pack' into jc/bundle
 - bundle v3: the beginning
 - bundle: keep a copy of bundle file name in the in-core bundle header
 - bundle: plug resource leak
 - bundle doc: 'verify' is not about verifying the bundle

 The beginning of "split bundle", which could be one of the
 ingredients to allow "git clone" traffic off of the core server
 network to CDN.

* jc/name-rev (2017-03-16) 2 commits
 . name-rev: favor describing with tags and use committer date to tiebreak
 . name-rev: refactor logic to see if a new candidate is a better name

 "git name-rev" penalized lightweight tags too much, making them
 almost useless especially when the command is run with "--tags".
 Give the same precedence to lightweight tags as annotated tags as
 the base for naming a commit.

 Now part of mg/name-rev-debug topic.


* jc/p4-current-branch-fix (2017-03-27) 2 commits
 . DONTMERGE git-p4: "name-rev HEAD" is not a way to find the current branch
 . git-p4: add failing test for name-rev rather than symbolic-ref

 "git p4" used "name-rev HEAD" when it wants to learn what branch is
 checked out; it should use "symbolic-ref HEAD".

 Superseded by the ld/p4-current-branch-fix topic.
