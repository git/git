What's cooking in git.git (Aug 2021, #02; Tue, 3)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen',
which means nothing more than that I have found them of interest for
some reason (like "it may have hard-to-resolve conflicts with
another topic already in flight" or "this may turn out to be
useful").  Do not read too much into a topic being in (or not in)
'seen'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of the
integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

A preview release Git 2.33-rc0 has been tagged.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/

 "git p4" in Python-2 days used to accept a lot more kinds of data

 which broke traditional use cases.

  (merged to 'next' on 2021-08-03 at a027d43cca)
 + mingw: align symlinks-related rmdir() behavior with Linux

 Windows rmdir() equivalent behaves differently from POSIX ones in
 that when used on a symbolic link that points at a directory, the
 target directory gets removed, which has been corrected.

 + bisect: simplify return code from bisect_checkout()
 + bisect: do not run show-branch just to show the current commit

 "git bisect" spawned "git show-branch" only to pretty-print the
 title of the commit after checking out the next version to be
 tested; this has been rewritten in C.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* jc/trivial-threeway-binary-merge (2021-07-28) 1 commit
 - ll-merge: teach ll_binary_merge() a trivial three-way merge

 The built-in merge driver for binary files learned to resolve
 trivial three-way merges (e.g. apply change, which turns A into B,
 to content A) by itself, which would help "git apply --3way" used
 when there is no need to use "--3way".

 Will discard.
 Replace with a trivial-merge logic in apply.c::try_treeway() or
 apply.c::three_way_merge().


* ab/http-drop-old-curl (2021-07-30) 5 commits

 The code to show progress indicator in a few codepaths did not
 cover between 0-100%, which has been corrected.

 Waiting for a clarification.
 cf. <xmqqbl6slmer.fsf@gitster.g>

 but went ahead and rebased when the history on other side is not a
 descendant of our history.  The series tries to fix them up.

* ab/doc-retire-alice-bob (2021-06-16) 6 commits
 . pack-protocol doc: use "www-data" in place of "alice"
 . doc: replace "alice" and "bob" with "jdoe" and "msmith"
 . fast-import doc: change "bob" in an example to "file.txt"

 . gitcvs-migration doc: replace "alice" and "bob" with "you" and "www-data"

 Documentation update to avoid Alice and Bob in contexts where Eve
 does not appear in.

 Will discard.
 Let's shelve this one for now, as it does not seem to solve any
 real problems (other than ceasing to use Alice and Bob in contexts
 that do not call for Eve).

* os/bisect-runs-show-branch-without-pager (2021-07-27) 1 commit
 - bisect: disable pager while invoking show-branch

 When "git bisect" spawns "git show-branch" to pretty-print the
 title of the commit to be tested, it could have invoked user's
 pager if user configured to run pager while running show-branch.
 The invocation of show-branch has been changed to disable pager,
 even if one is configured.

 Will discard.
 This probably is unnecessary with the rewrite to get rid of the
 show-branch invocation altogether.
