What's cooking in git.git (Jan 2024, #04; Thu, 11)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and
aren't considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL
to a message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity (of course they can be resubmit when new interests
arise).

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/

 - refs: prepare `refs_init_db()` for initializing worktree refs
 - Merge branch 'ps/refstorage-extension' into ps/worktree-refdb-initialization
 (this branch uses ps/refstorage-extension.)

 Instead of manually creating refs/ hierarchy on disk upon a

 "git apply" on a filesystem without filemode support have learned
 to take a hint from what is in the index for the path, even when
 not working with the "--index" or "--cached" option, when checking
 the executable bit match what is required by the preimage in the
 patch.
