What's cooking in git.git (Mar 2011, #06; Thu, 31)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.

It's been two months since v1.7.4 and -rc0 was way overdue.  I'll do a -rc1
sometime next week, hoping that we can finish this cycle by mid April.

Which means that from now on, we wouldn't be interested in topics that are
mostly internal clean-ups, new features that is not already in 'master',
nor fixes for nontrivial bugs that are not regressions.  A bug that
existed since v1.7.0 is something we have lived with long enough that it
is not worth the risk of introducing other new bugs by trying to fix it
before 1.7.5 final).

What we would want to see are regression fixes.  There are quite a few new
topics that have already graduated in 'master', or have been cooking and
should be in 'master' shortly.  If they introduce new bugs that didn't
exist in v1.7.4, they need to be squashed before anything else.

The criteria is a bit looser for documentation updates.  Simple grammar
and spelling fixes are usually safe; changes in the structure and markups
are riskier.

In any case, please use your best judgement and help polishing v1.7.5
release.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* jh/notes-add-ui (2011-03-30) 1 commit
 - Make "git notes add" more user-friendly when there are existing notes

* jk/maint-remote-mirror-safer (2011-03-30) 3 commits
 - remote: deprecate --mirror
 - remote: separate the concept of push and fetch mirrors
 - remote: disallow some nonsensical option combinations

* jk/notes-ui-updates (2011-03-30) 7 commits
 - log/pretty-options: Document --[no-]notes and deprecate old notes options
 - revision.c: make --no-notes reset --notes list
 - revision.c: support --notes command-line option
 - notes: refactor display notes default handling
 - notes: refactor display notes extra refs field
 - revision.c: refactor notes ref expansion
 - notes: make expand_notes_ref globally accessible

* jr/grep-en-config (2011-03-30) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-03-31 at 2a73028)
 + grep: allow -E and -n to be turned on by default via configuration

This is low impact, isolated, and has no risk of breaking the system as a
whole. May merge by rc1.

* nd/maint-setup (2011-03-26) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-03-31 at 2c36f6a)
 + Kill off get_relative_cwd()
 + setup: return correct prefix if worktree is '/'

This benefits only the minority who use /.git at the root level of the
filesystem, but the changed code is used from many codepaths; will not
merge before 1.7.5.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* jc/diff-irreversible-delete (2011-02-28) 1 commit
 - git diff -D: omit the preimage of deletes

"diff -B -D" should omit the deleting half of a broken pair from the
output.  This is low impact, isolated, and has no risk of breaking the
system as a whole, but the topic needs documentation and tests.

* gr/cvsimport-alternative-cvspass-location (2011-02-18) 1 commit
 - Look for password in both CVS and CVSNT password files.

It seems that we need separate parsers for these two formats in order not
to regress the users of the original cvs.

* jc/index-pack (2011-02-25) 5 commits
 - index-pack --verify: read anomalous offsets from v2 idx file
 - write_idx_file: need_large_offset() helper function
 - index-pack: --verify
 - write_idx_file: introduce a struct to hold idx customization options
 - index-pack: group the delta-base array entries also by type

Still a WIP, and will not be ready for 1.7.5. Need to put histogram output
into index-pack --verify to really kill verify-pack.

* jk/tag-contains (2010-07-05) 4 commits
 - Why is "git tag --contains" so slow?
 - default core.clockskew variable to one day
 - limit "contains" traversals based on commit timestamp
 - tag: speed up --contains calculation

The idea of the bottom one is probably Ok, except that the use of object
flags needs to be rethought, or at least the helper needs to be moved to
builtin/tag.c to make it clear that it should not be used outside the
current usage context.

* jk/edit-notes-in-commit-log (2011-03-07) 2 commits
 - [wip] commit: allow editing notes in commit message editor
 - notes: make expand_notes_ref globally accessible

* mg/grep-full-tree (2011-03-01) 2 commits
 - grep: make --full-tree work with pathspecs
 - grep: --full-tree

Do not merge; it would be preferable to use ":/" or whatever magic
pathspec that is relative to the root of the working tree.

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* mz/rebase (2011-02-28) 34 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-03-31 at 3b1343c)
 + rebase: define options in OPTIONS_SPEC
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-02-25 at 52caa7a)
 + Makefile: do not install sourced rebase scripts
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-02-22 at 3219155)
 + rebase: use @{upstream} if no upstream specified
 + rebase -i: remove unnecessary state rebase-root
 + rebase -i: don't read unused variable preserve_merges
 + git-rebase--am: remove unnecessary --3way option
 + rebase -m: don't print exit code 2 when merge fails
 + rebase -m: remember allow_rerere_autoupdate option
 + rebase: remember strategy and strategy options
 + rebase: remember verbose option
 + rebase: extract code for writing basic state
 + rebase: factor out sub command handling
 + rebase: make -v a tiny bit more verbose
 + rebase -i: align variable names
 + rebase: show consistent conflict resolution hint
 + rebase: extract am code to new source file
 + rebase: extract merge code to new source file
 + rebase: remove $branch as synonym for $orig_head
 + rebase -i: support --stat
 + rebase: factor out call to pre-rebase hook
 + rebase: factor out clean work tree check
 + rebase: factor out reference parsing
 + rebase: reorder validation steps
 + rebase -i: remove now unnecessary directory checks
 + rebase: factor out command line option processing
 + rebase: align variable content
 + rebase: align variable names
 + rebase: stricter check of standalone sub command
 + rebase: act on command line outside parsing loop
 + rebase: improve detection of rebase in progress
 + rebase: remove unused rebase state 'prev_head'
 + rebase: read state outside loop
 + rebase: refactor reading of state
 + rebase: clearer names for directory variables

I wanted to wait for an independent Ack or two for the tip one, which was
a response to regression concerns raised by J6t, but ended up merging it
after giving another look.  Will not merge before 1.7.5, as there is no
user visible improvements up to this point.

* jc/merge-sans-branch (2011-03-23) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-03-31 at 754a6af)
 + merge: merge with the default upstream branch without argument
 + merge: match the help text with the documentation

Allow running "git merge" without telling it what to merge.  It will merge
with the "upstream" of the current branch if configured.  This is low
impact, isolated, and has no risk of major regression.  May merge before
rc1, but it is Ok to wait.

* jh/gitweb-localtime (2011-03-23) 1 commit
 - gitweb: javascript ability to adjust time based on timezone

* jk/maint-merge-rename-create (2011-03-25) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-03-31 at b9bc9f1)
 + merge: turn on rewrite detection
 + merge: handle renames with replacement content
 + t3030: fix accidental success in symlink rename

May merge before rc1, but it is Ok to wait.

* jk/pull-into-empty (2011-03-25) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-03-31 at d4dd598)
 + pull: do not clobber untracked files on initial pull
 + merge: merge unborn index before setting ref

This is low impact, isolated, and has no risk of major regression. Will
merge before rc1.

* mz/maint-rename-unmerged (2011-03-23) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-03-31 at c7b3d9a)
 + diffcore-rename: don't consider unmerged path as source

Will cook until 1.7.5 final.

* nd/struct-pathspec (2011-03-25) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-03-31 at 66cbb7d)
 + Improve tree_entry_interesting() handling code
 + Convert read_tree{,_recursive} to support struct pathspec
 + Reimplement read_tree_recursive() using tree_entry_interesting()
 + Merge branch 'en/object-list-with-pathspec' into 'nd/struct-pathspec'

Will cook until 1.7.5 final.

* jc/add-u-migration (2011-03-22) 3 commits
 - add: make "add -u/-A" update full tree without pathspec (step 3)
 - add: make "add -u/-A" update full tree without pathspec (step 2)
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-03-31 at 962e058)
 + add: make "add -u/-A" update full tree without pathspec

The bottom one is a necessary first step toward the UI clean-up planned
for 1.8.0 which we discussed in length in the earlier part of the cycle;
the change is low impact, isolated, and has no risk of breaking the system
as a whole, but I would wait until the ":/" magic pathspec materializes,
as the advice message would have to become different, and the way to get
more stable semantics will become more direct.

* jk/progress-with-pager (2011-03-24) 4 commits
 - diff: turn on rename detection progress reporting
 - show: turn on rename detection progress reporting
 - progress: use pager's original_stderr if available
 - pager: save the original stderr when redirecting to pager

Will cook until 1.7.5 final.

* sb/sparse-more (2011-03-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-03-23 at 4bec1d1)
 + Makefile: Cover more files with make check

Will merge.

* jc/rename-degrade-cc-to-c (2011-01-06) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-03-31 at 8d685d7)
 + diffcore-rename: fall back to -C when -C -C busts the rename limit
 + diffcore-rename: record filepair for rename src
 + diffcore-rename: refactor "too many candidates" logic
 + builtin/diff.c: remove duplicated call to diff_result_code()

Will hold.

* cn/system-path-tweak (2011-03-17) 1 commit
 - system_path: use a static buffer

* en/merge-recursive (2011-03-17) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-03-18 at a32016b)
 + merge-recursive: tweak magic band-aid
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-03-09 at 3762932)
 + merge-recursive: When we detect we can skip an update, actually skip it
 + t6022: New test checking for unnecessary updates of files in D/F conflicts
 + t6022: New test checking for unnecessary updates of renamed+modified files

I am not happy with these magic band aids.  Will hold.

* nd/init-gitdir (2011-03-19) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-03-31 at 3b8fb40)
 + init, clone: support --separate-git-dir for .git file
 + git-init.txt: move description section up

Will merge.

* jl/submodule-fetch-on-demand (2011-03-06) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-03-20 at a5e452d)
 + fetch/pull: Describe --recurse-submodule restrictions in the BUGS section
 + submodule update: Don't fetch when the submodule commit is already present
 + fetch/pull: Don't recurse into a submodule when commits are already present
 + Submodules: Add 'on-demand' value for the 'fetchRecurseSubmodule' option
 + config: teach the fetch.recurseSubmodules option the 'on-demand' value
 + fetch/pull: Add the 'on-demand' value to the --recurse-submodules option
 + fetch/pull: recurse into submodules when necessary

Will merge.

[Discarded]

* jc/diff-dotdot (2011-03-23) 2 commits
 . warn use of "git diff A..B"
 . diff: remove dead code that flips arguments order

This was 1/4 tongue-in-cheek. Now we seem to have a handful of volunteer
cluebat bearers, and I wouldn't have to worry about this topic very much.

* jh/merge-sans-branch (2011-02-10) 4 commits
 . merge: add support for merging from upstream by default
 . merge: introduce per-branch-configuration helper function
 . merge: introduce setup_merge_commit helper function
 . merge: update the usage information to be more modern

I've been wanting to move this forward for quite some time but 
ended up redoing it myself (see jc/merge-sans-branch)
