What's cooking in git.git (Sep 2018, #04; Thu, 20)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

The tip of 'next' hasn't been rewound yet.  The three GSoC "rewrite
in C" topics are still unclassified in this "What's cooking" report,
but I am hoping that we can have them in 'next' sooner rather than
later.  I got an impression that Dscho wanted a chance for the final
clean-up on some of them, so I am not doing anything hasty yet at
this moment, though.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

* ab/fetch-tags-noclobber (2018-08-31) 11 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-09-20 at 3e950afa0f)
 + fetch doc: correct grammar in --force docs
 + push doc: add spacing between two words
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-09-14 at 0384a7a8b4)
 + fetch: stop clobbering existing tags without --force
 + fetch: document local ref updates with/without --force
 + push doc: correct lies about how push refspecs work
 + push doc: move mention of "tag <tag>" later in the prose
 + push doc: remove confusing mention of remote merger
 + fetch tests: add a test for clobbering tag behavior
 + push tests: use spaces in interpolated string
 + push tests: make use of unused $1 in test description
 + fetch: change "branch" to "reference" in --force -h output

 The rules used by "git push" and "git fetch" to determine if a ref
 can or cannot be updated were inconsistent; specifically, fetching
 to update existing tags were allowed even though tags are supposed
 to be unmoving anchoring points.  "git fetch" was taught to forbid
 updates to existing tags without the "--force" option.
 This is a backward incompatible change but in a good way; it may
 still need to be treated carefully.


* bp/checkout-new-branch-optim (2018-08-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-09-20 at 329edd4960)
 + config doc: add missing list separator for checkout.optimizeNewBranch
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-08-27 at e69bfd115f)
 + checkout: optimize "git checkout -b <new_branch>"

 "git checkout -b newbranch [HEAD]" should not have to do as much as
 checking out a commit different from HEAD.  An attempt is made to
 optimize this special case.


* cc/delta-islands (2018-08-16) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-08-27 at cf3d7bd93f)
 + pack-objects: move 'layer' into 'struct packing_data'
 + pack-objects: move tree_depth into 'struct packing_data'
 + t5320: tests for delta islands
 + repack: add delta-islands support
 + pack-objects: add delta-islands support
 + pack-objects: refactor code into compute_layer_order()
 + Add delta-islands.{c,h}

 Lift code from GitHub to restrict delta computation so that an
 object that exists in one fork is not made into a delta against
 another object that does not appear in the same forked repository.


* ds/commit-graph-tests (2018-08-29) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-09-14 at d072a0ee3e)
 + commit-graph: define GIT_TEST_COMMIT_GRAPH

 We can now optionally run tests with commit-graph enabled.


* ds/multi-pack-index (2018-08-20) 33 commits

 + midx: mark bad packed objects
 + multi-pack-index: store local property
 + multi-pack-index: provide more helpful usage info
 + Sync 'ds/multi-pack-index' to v2.19.0-rc0
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-08-08 at 1a56c52967)
 + midx: clear midx on repack
 + packfile: skip loading index if in multi-pack-index
 + midx: prevent duplicate packfile loads

 + midx: write header information to lockfile
 + multi-pack-index: add 'write' verb
 + multi-pack-index: add builtin
 + multi-pack-index: add format details
 + multi-pack-index: add design document
 (this branch is used by ds/multi-pack-verify.)

 When there are too many packfiles in a repository (which is not
 recommended), looking up an object in these would require
 consulting many pack .idx files; a new mechanism to have a single
 file that consolidates all of these .idx files is introduced.


* ds/reachable (2018-08-28) 19 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-08-28 at b1634b371d)
 + commit-reach: correct accidental #include of C file
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-08-22 at 17f3275afb)

 The code for computing history reachability has been shuffled,
 obtained a bunch of new tests to cover them, and then being
 improved.


* es/format-patch-interdiff (2018-07-23) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-08-31 at 63927e0227)
 + format-patch: allow --interdiff to apply to a lone-patch

 + interdiff: teach show_interdiff() to indent interdiff
 + format-patch: teach --interdiff to respect -v/--reroll-count
 + format-patch: add --interdiff option to embed diff in cover letter
 + format-patch: allow additional generated content in make_cover_letter()
 (this branch is used by ds/format-patch-range-diff-test and es/format-patch-rangediff.)

 "git format-patch" learned a new "--interdiff" option to explain
 the difference between this version and the previous atttempt in
 the cover letter (or after the tree-dashes as a comment).


* es/format-patch-rangediff (2018-08-14) 10 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-08-31 at 65627afece)
 + format-patch: allow --range-diff to apply to a lone-patch

 + Merge branch 'es/format-patch-interdiff' into es/format-patch-rangediff
 + Merge branch 'js/range-diff' into es/format-patch-rangediff
 (this branch is used by ds/format-patch-range-diff-test; uses es/format-patch-interdiff.)

 "git format-patch" learned a new "--range-diff" option to explain
 the difference between this version and the previous attempt in
 the cover letter (or after the tree-dashes as a comment).


* es/worktree-forced-ops-fix (2018-09-05) 10 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-09-14 at 1a0cc3204d)
 + doc-diff: force worktree add
 + worktree: delete .git/worktrees if empty after 'remove'
 + worktree: teach 'remove' to override lock when --force given twice
 + worktree: teach 'move' to override lock when --force given twice
 + worktree: teach 'add' to respect --force for registered but missing path
 + worktree: disallow adding same path multiple times
 + worktree: prepare for more checks of whether path can become worktree
 + worktree: generalize delete_git_dir() to reduce code duplication
 + worktree: move delete_git_dir() earlier in file for upcoming new callers
 + worktree: don't die() in library function find_worktree()

 Fix a bug in which the same path could be registered under multiple
 worktree entries if the path was missing (for instance, was removed
 manually).  Also, as a convenience, expand the number of cases in
 which --force is applicable.


* jk/branch-l-1-repurpose (2018-08-30) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-08-31 at cfa73bbfcb)
 + doc/git-branch: remove obsolete "-l" references
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-08-08 at d2a08dd08e)
 + branch: make "-l" a synonym for "--list"

 Updated plan to repurpose the "-l" option to "git branch".


* jk/cocci (2018-08-29) 9 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-08-31 at 914b4f17ce)
 + show_dirstat: simplify same-content check
 + read-cache: use oideq() in ce_compare functions
 + convert hashmap comparison functions to oideq()
 + convert "hashcmp() != 0" to "!hasheq()"
 + convert "oidcmp() != 0" to "!oideq()"
 + convert "hashcmp() == 0" to hasheq()
 + convert "oidcmp() == 0" to oideq()
 + introduce hasheq() and oideq()
 + coccinelle: use <...> for function exclusion

 spatch transformation to replace boolean uses of !hashcmp() to
 newly introduced oideq() is added, and applied, to regain
 performance lost due to support of multiple hash algorithms.


* jk/diff-rendered-docs (2018-08-31) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-09-14 at 9b43d5a568)
 + doc/Makefile: drop doc-diff worktree and temporary files on "make clean"
 + doc-diff: add --clean mode to remove temporary working gunk
 + doc-diff: fix non-portable 'man' invocation
 + doc-diff: always use oids inside worktree
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-08-22 at dd7a2b71cd)
 + SubmittingPatches: mention doc-diff

 Dev doc update.


* jk/pack-delta-reuse-with-bitmap (2018-08-21) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-08-22 at fc50b59dab)
 + pack-objects: reuse on-disk deltas for thin "have" objects
 + pack-bitmap: save "have" bitmap from walk
 + t/perf: add perf tests for fetches from a bitmapped server
 + t/perf: add infrastructure for measuring sizes
 + t/perf: factor out percent calculations
 + t/perf: factor boilerplate out of test_perf
 (this branch is used by jk/pack-objects-with-bitmap-fix.)

 When creating a thin pack, which allows objects to be made into a
 delta against another object that is not in the resulting pack but
 is known to be present on the receiving end, the code learned to
 take advantage of the reachability bitmap; this allows the server
 to send a delta against a base beyond the "boundary" commit.


* jk/pack-objects-with-bitmap-fix (2018-09-04) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-09-14 at 392eb2abb1)
 + pack-bitmap: drop "loaded" flag
 + traverse_bitmap_commit_list(): don't free result
 + t5310: test delta reuse with bitmaps
 + bitmap_has_sha1_in_uninteresting(): drop BUG check
 (this branch uses jk/pack-delta-reuse-with-bitmap.)

 Hotfix of the base topic.


* jk/patch-corrupted-delta-fix (2018-08-30) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-09-14 at 7517309cb0)
 + t5303: use printf to generate delta bases
 + patch-delta: handle truncated copy parameters
 + patch-delta: consistently report corruption
 + patch-delta: fix oob read
 + t5303: test some corrupt deltas
 + test-delta: read input into a heap buffer

 Malformed or crafted data in packstream can make our code attempt
 to read or write past the allocated buffer and abort, instead of
 reporting an error, which has been fixed.


* jk/rev-list-stdin-noop-is-ok (2018-08-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-08-27 at d5916f7bc1)
 + rev-list: make empty --stdin not an error

 "git rev-list --stdin </dev/null" used to be an error; it now shows
 no output without an error.  "git rev-list --stdin --default HEAD"
 still falls back to the given default when nothing is given on the
 standard input.


* jk/trailer-fixes (2018-08-23) 8 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-08-27 at 93b671b8c6)
 + append_signoff: use size_t for string offsets
 + sequencer: ignore "---" divider when parsing trailers
 + pretty, ref-filter: format %(trailers) with no_divider option
 + interpret-trailers: allow suppressing "---" divider
 + interpret-trailers: tighten check for "---" patch boundary
 + trailer: pass process_trailer_opts to trailer_info_get()
 + trailer: use size_t for iterating trailer list
 + trailer: use size_t for string offsets

 "git interpret-trailers" and its underlying machinery had a buggy
 code that attempted to ignore patch text after commit log message,
 which triggered in various codepaths that will always get the log
 message alone and never get such an input.


* mk/http-backend-content-length (2018-09-11) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-09-11 at e8095fc635)
 + http-backend test: make empty CONTENT_LENGTH test more realistic

 Test update.


* nd/bisect-show-list-fix (2018-09-04) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-09-14 at 18242da7ef)
 + bisect.c: make show_list() build again

 Debugging aid update.


* nd/clone-case-smashing-warning (2018-08-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-08-22 at eedae40a8d)
 + clone: report duplicate entries on case-insensitive filesystems

 Running "git clone" against a project that contain two files with
 pathnames that differ only in cases on a case insensitive
 filesystem would result in one of the files lost because the
 underlying filesystem is incapable of holding both at the same
 time.  An attempt is made to detect such a case and warn.


* nd/unpack-trees-with-cache-tree (2018-08-27) 8 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-08-27 at b1d841d034)
 + Document update for nd/unpack-trees-with-cache-tree
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-08-22 at 138b902673)
 + cache-tree: verify valid cache-tree in the test suite
 + unpack-trees: add missing cache invalidation
 + unpack-trees: reuse (still valid) cache-tree from src_index
 + unpack-trees: reduce malloc in cache-tree walk
 + unpack-trees: optimize walking same trees with cache-tree
 + unpack-trees: add performance tracing
 + trace.h: support nested performance tracing

 The unpack_trees() API used in checking out a branch and merging
 walks one or more trees along with the index.  When the cache-tree
 in the index tells us that we are walking a tree whose flattened
 contents is known (i.e. matches a span in the index), as linearly
 scanning a span in the index is much more efficient than having to
 open tree objects recursively and listing their entries, the walk
 can be optimized, which is done in this topic.


* rs/mailinfo-format-flowed (2018-08-29) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-08-31 at 9e8b92176c)
 + mailinfo: support format=flowed

 "git mailinfo" used in "git am" learned to make a best-effort
 recovery of a patch corrupted by MUA that sends text/plain with
 format=flawed option.


* sb/range-diff-colors (2018-08-20) 11 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-08-22 at eb7ed4fca3)
 + range-diff: indent special lines as context
 + range-diff: make use of different output indicators
 + diff.c: add --output-indicator-{new, old, context}
 + diff.c: rewrite emit_line_0 more understandably
 + diff.c: omit check for line prefix in emit_line_0
 + diff: use emit_line_0 once per line
 + diff.c: add set_sign to emit_line_0
 + diff.c: reorder arguments for emit_line_ws_markup
 + diff.c: simplify caller of emit_line_0
 + t3206: add color test for range-diff --dual-color
 + test_decode_color: understand FAINT and ITALIC

 The color output support for recently introduced "range-diff"
 command got tweaked a bit.


* sb/submodule-update-in-c (2018-08-14) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-08-17 at 23c81e5ff7)
 + submodule--helper: introduce new update-module-mode helper
 + submodule--helper: replace connect-gitdir-workingtree by ensure-core-worktree
 + builtin/submodule--helper: factor out method to update a single submodule
 + builtin/submodule--helper: store update_clone information in a struct
 + builtin/submodule--helper: factor out submodule updating
 + git-submodule.sh: rename unused variables
 + git-submodule.sh: align error reporting for update mode to use path

 "git submodule update" is getting rewritten piece-by-piece into C.


* sg/doc-trace-appends (2018-09-04) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-09-14 at 6d82abb8bf)
 + Documentation/git.txt: clarify that GIT_TRACE=/path appends

 Docfix.


* sg/t1404-update-ref-test-timeout (2018-08-01) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-08-22 at f3cd37b5ea)
 + t1404: increase core.packedRefsTimeout to avoid occasional test failure

 An attempt to unflake a test a bit.


* tg/conflict-marker-size (2018-08-29) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-08-31 at 12099161f0)
 + .gitattributes: add conflict-marker-size for relevant files

 Developer aid.


* tg/rerere (2018-08-06) 11 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-08-17 at 919a958cdc)
 + rerere: recalculate conflict ID when unresolved conflict is committed
 + rerere: teach rerere to handle nested conflicts
 + rerere: return strbuf from handle path
 + rerere: factor out handle_conflict function

 + rerere: add documentation for conflict normalization
 + rerere: mark strings for translation
 + rerere: wrap paths in output in sq
 + rerere: lowercase error messages
 + rerere: unify error messages when read_cache fails
 (this branch is used by tg/rerere-doc-updates.)

 Fixes to "git rerere" corner cases, especially when conflict
 markers cannot be parsed in the file.


* tg/rerere-doc-updates (2018-08-29) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-08-31 at ce4fef1a97)
 + rerere: add note about files with existing conflict markers
 + rerere: mention caveat about unmatched conflict markers
 (this branch uses tg/rerere.)

 Clarify a part of technical documentation for rerere.

  (merged to 'next' on 2018-08-31 at 7527e0f8d3)
 + Documentation/Makefile: make manpage-base-url.xsl generation quieter

* bw/submodule-name-to-dir (2018-08-10) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-08-22 at c17f83be24)
 + submodule: munge paths to submodule git directories
 + submodule: create helper to build paths to submodule gitdirs

 In modern repository layout, the real body of a cloned submodule
 repository is held in .git/modules/ of the superproject, indexed by
 the submodule name.  URLencode the submodule name before computing
 the name of the directory to make sure they form a flat namespace.

 "git status --ignored" gained a shorthand "git status -i".

 Will discard, after hearing no strong support.
 What's the list opinion on this one?  It is Meh to me, but
 obviously the author cared enough to write a patch, so...

 "git commit --dry-run" gave a correct exit status even during a
 conflict resolution toward a merge, but it did not with the
 "--short" option, which has been corrected.

 Seems to break 7512, 3404 and 7060 in 'pu'.

 (this branch is used by tb/bisect-first-parent.)

 Preliminary code update to allow passing more flags down the

 before too long.

* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2017-08-10) 1 commit
 . zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

 Needs resurrecting by making sure the fix is good and still applies
 (or adjusted to today's codebase).

* pw/add-p-select (2018-07-26) 4 commits
 - add -p: optimize line selection for short hunks
 - add -p: allow line selection to be inverted
 - add -p: select modified lines correctly
 - add -p: select individual hunk lines

 "git add -p" interactive interface learned to let users choose
 individual added/removed lines to be used in the operation, instead
 of accepting or rejecting a whole hunk.

 Will hold.
 cf. <d622a95b-7302-43d4-4ec9-b2cf3388c653@talktalk.net>
 I found the feature to be hard to explain, and may result in more
 end-user complaints, but let's see.


* ds/commit-graph-with-grafts (2018-08-21) 8 commits
 - commit-graph: close_commit_graph before shallow walk
 - commit-graph: not compatible with uninitialized repo
 - commit-graph: not compatible with grafts
 - commit-graph: not compatible with replace objects
 - test-repository: properly init repo
 - commit-graph: update design document
 - refs.c: upgrade for_each_replace_ref to be a each_repo_ref_fn callback
 - refs.c: migrate internal ref iteration to pass thru repository argument

 The recently introduced commit-graph auxiliary data is incompatible
 with mechanisms such as replace & grafts that "breaks" immutable
 nature of the object reference relationship.  Disable optimizations
 based on its use (and updating existing commit-graph) when these
 incompatible features are in use in the repository.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jn/gc-auto (2018-07-17) 1 commit
 - gc: do not return error for prior errors in daemonized mode
 (this branch uses jn/gc-auto-prep.)

 "gc --auto" ended up calling exit(-1) upon error, which has been
 corrected to use exit(1).  Also the error reporting behaviour when
 daemonized has been updated to exit with zero status when stopping
 due to a previously discovered error (which implies there is no
 point running gc to improve the situation); we used to exit with
 failure in such a case.

 Rewrite of the remaining "rebase -i" machinery in C.


* lt/date-human (2018-07-09) 1 commit
 - Add 'human' date format

 A new date format "--date=human" that morphs its output depending
 on how far the time is from the current time has been introduced.
 "--date=auto" can be used to use this new format when the output is
 goint to the pager or to the terminal and otherwise the default
 format.

* am/sequencer-author-script-fix (2018-07-18) 1 commit
 . sequencer.c: terminate the last line of author-script properly

 The author-script that records the author information created by
 the sequencer machinery lacked the closing single quote on the last
 entry.

 Superseded by another topic.

 . t0410: test fetching from many promisor remotes
 . Use odb.origin.partialclonefilter instead of core.partialclonefilter
 . Use remote_odb_get_direct() and has_remote_odb()
 . remote-odb: add remote_odb_reinit()
 . remote-odb: implement remote_odb_get_many_direct()
 . remote-odb: implement remote_odb_get_direct()
 . Add initial remote odb support
 . fetch-object: make functions return an error code

 Implement lazy fetches of missing objects to complement the
 experimental partial clone feature.

 Ejected; seems to break existing repositories that use partialclone
 repository extension.

 I haven't seen much interest in this topic on list.  What's the
 doneness of this thing?

 I do not particularly mind adding code to support a niche feature
 as long as it is cleanly made and it is clear that the feature
 won't negatively affect those who do not use it, so a review from
 that point of view may also be appropriate.

 Also there were backward incompatible API changes brought by other
 topics in flight; having to keep up with those disruptive changes
 is not worth the maintenance effort for a stale topic.

 has been optimized.

 Absorbed in bp/read-cache-parallel topic.
