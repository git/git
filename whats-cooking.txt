What's cooking in git.git (Dec 2024, #06; Mon, 16)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and
aren't considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL
to a message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity (of course they can be resubmit when new interests
arise).

An early preview release Git 2.48-rc0 has been tagged.  The rate of
arrival of new topics unfortunately exceeds the rate of reviews and
iterations, which means that many topics are left out of 'next',
waiting to be reviewed.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-scm/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

Release tarballs are available at:

 remotes.

 Needs review.

 "git refs migrate" learned to also migrate the reflog data across
 backends.

* jc/set-head-symref-fix (2024-12-07) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2024-12-13 at 478444359e)
 + fetch: do not ask for HEAD unnecessarily
 + Merge branch 'bf/set-head-symref' into js/set-head-symref-fix
 (this branch uses bf/set-head-symref.)

 "git fetch" from a configured remote learned to update a missing
 remote-tracking HEAD but it asked the remote about their HEAD even
 when it did not need to, which has been corrected.  Incidentally,
 this also corrects "git fetch --tags $URL" which was broken by the
 new feature in an unspecified way.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 - git-submodule.sh: get rid of isnumber
 - git-submodule.sh: improve parsing of short options
 - git-submodule.sh: improve parsing of some long options

 "git submodule" learned various ways to spell the same option,
 e.g. "--branch=B" can be spelled "--branch B" or "-bB".

  (merged to 'next' on 2024-12-04 at 69bfc59fb5)
 + fetch: add configuration for set_head behaviour
 + Merge branch 'bf/set-head-symref' into bf/fetch-set-head-config
 (this branch uses bf/set-head-symref.)

 "git fetch" honors "remote.<remote>.followRemoteHEAD" settings to
 tweak the remote-tracking HEAD in "refs/remotes/<remote>/HEAD".

 Will merge to 'master' after bf/set-head-symref and its fix-up.

 - transport: don't ignore git-receive-pack(1) exit code on atomic push
 - t5504: modernize test by moving heredocs into test bodies

 "git push --atomic --porcelain" used to ignore failures from the
 other side, losing the error status from the child process, which
 has been corrected.
