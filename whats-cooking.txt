What's cooking in git.git (Aug 2017, #07; Sat, 26)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

As I am preparing to go offline next week for about a week, a
handful of topics have been merged to 'master' and 'next' is getting
thinner.  There are a few topics of importance that are still only
on the mailing list archive and not in my tree that I'd like to
review them and help them get into a reasonable shape, but that
hasn't happened yet.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

[Graduated to "master"]

* bc/vcs-svn-cleanup (2017-08-20) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-22 at d8494b5d5b)
 + vcs-svn: rename repo functions to "svn_repo"
 + vcs-svn: remove unused prototypes
 (this branch is used by bc/hash-algo and jn/vcs-svn-cleanup.)

 Code clean-up.


* bw/submodule-config-cleanup (2017-08-03) 17 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-24 at e35d58c4c6)
 + submodule: remove gitmodules_config
 + unpack-trees: improve loading of .gitmodules
 + submodule-config: lazy-load a repository's .gitmodules file
 + submodule-config: move submodule-config functions to submodule-config.c
 + submodule-config: remove support for overlaying repository config
 + diff: stop allowing diff to have submodules configured in .git/config
 + submodule: remove submodule_config callback routine
 + unpack-trees: don't respect submodule.update
 + submodule: don't rely on overlayed config when setting diffopts
 + fetch: don't overlay config with submodule-config
 + submodule--helper: don't overlay config in update-clone
 + submodule--helper: don't overlay config in remote_submodule_branch
 + add, reset: ensure submodules can be added or reset
 + submodule: don't use submodule_from_name
 + t7411: check configuration parsing errors
 + Merge branch 'bc/object-id' into bw/submodule-config-cleanup
 + Merge branch 'bw/grep-recurse-submodules' into bw/submodule-config-cleanup

 Code clean-up to avoid mixing values read from the .gitmodules file
 and values read from the .git/config file.
 So, after the recent discussion around submodule.<name>.update (and
 its resolution "use submodule.<name>.active; "reset --hard" must
 ignore the .update thing"), this is now good to go, I presume?
 Please yell at me that I am clueless if that is not the case ;-)


* jc/cutoff-config (2017-08-22) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-24 at 2dcbf9ae04)
 + rerere: allow approxidate in gc.rerereResolved/gc.rerereUnresolved
 + rerere: represent time duration in timestamp_t internally
 + t4200: parameterize "rerere gc" custom expiry test
 + t4200: gather "rerere gc" together
 + t4200: make "rerere gc" test more robust
 + t4200: give us a clean slate after "rerere gc" tests

 "[gc] rerereResolved = 5.days" used to be invalid, as the variable
 is defined to take an integer counting the number of days.  It now
 is allowed.


* jk/trailers-parse (2017-08-20) 9 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-22 at 2d4d937141)
 + doc/interpret-trailers: fix "the this" typo
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-19 at faa63f8196)
 + pretty: support normalization options for %(trailers)
 + t4205: refactor %(trailers) tests
 + pretty: move trailer formatting to trailer.c
 + interpret-trailers: add --parse convenience option
 + interpret-trailers: add an option to unfold values
 + interpret-trailers: add an option to show only existing trailers
 + interpret-trailers: add an option to show only the trailers
 + trailer: put process_trailers() options into a struct

 "git interpret-trailers" has been taught a "--parse" and a few
 other options to make it easier for scripts to grab existing
 trailer lines from a commit log message.
 Possible leftover bits are mentioned in
 cf. <20170820094009.z23wclpku35txflg@sigill.intra.peff.net>


* jn/vcs-svn-cleanup (2017-08-23) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-24 at c184f08f5f)
 + vcs-svn: move remaining repo_tree functions to fast_export.h
 + vcs-svn: remove repo_delete wrapper function
 + vcs-svn: remove custom mode constants
 + vcs-svn: remove more unused prototypes and declarations
 (this branch uses bc/vcs-svn-cleanup; is tangled with bc/hash-algo.)

 Code clean-up.


* js/gitweb-raw-blob-link-in-history (2017-08-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-23 at 16258266e2)
 + gitweb: add 'raw' blob_plain link in history overview

 "gitweb" shows a link to visit the 'raw' contents of blbos in the
 history overview page.


* jt/diff-color-move-fix (2017-08-16) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-19 at 6ae3831c8c)
 + diff: define block by number of alphanumeric chars
 + diff: respect MIN_BLOCK_LENGTH for last block
 + diff: avoid redundantly clearing a flag
 (this branch uses sb/diff-color-move.)

 A handful of bugfixes and an improvement to "diff --color-moved".


* jt/doc-pack-objects-fix (2017-08-23) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-24 at 7e4c3c0c9f)
 + Doc: clarify that pack-objects makes packs, plural

 Doc updates.


* jt/packmigrate (2017-08-23) 23 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-24 at 34a628ae6c)
 + pack: move for_each_packed_object()

 + pack: move open_pack_index(), parse_pack_index()
 + pack: move pack_report()
 + pack: move static state variables
 + pack: move pack name-related functions

 Code movement to make it easier to hack later.


* jt/stash-tests (2017-08-19) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-22 at 0b022697aa)
 + stash: add a test for stashing in a detached state
 + stash: add a test for when apply fails during stash branch
 + stash: add a test for stash create with no files

 Test update to improve coverage for "git stash" operations.


* kw/write-index-reduce-alloc (2017-08-21) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-24 at 29f7daad85)
 + read-cache: avoid allocating every ondisk entry when writing
 + read-cache: fix memory leak in do_write_index
 + perf: add test for writing the index

 We used to spend more than necessary cycles allocating and freeing
 piece of memory while writing each index entry out.  This has been
 optimized.


* mg/killed-merge (2017-08-23) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-24 at 5db37fc192)
 + merge: save merge state earlier
 + merge: split write_merge_state in two
 + merge: clarify call chain
 + Documentation/git-merge: explain --continue

 Killing "git merge --edit" before the editor returns control left
 the repository in a state with MERGE_MSG but without MERGE_HEAD,
 which incorrectly tells the subsequent "git commit" that there was
 a squash merge in progress.  This has been fixed.


* mh/ref-lock-entry (2017-08-23) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-24 at 67760267f4)
 + refs: retry acquiring reference locks for 100ms

 The code to acquire a lock on a reference (e.g. while accepting a
 push from a client) used to immediately fail when the reference is
 already locked---now it waits for a very short while and retries,
 which can make it succeed if the lock holder was holding it during
 a read-only operation.


* pb/trailers-from-command-line (2017-08-14) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-19 at b12342e49e)
 + interpret-trailers: fix documentation typo
 + interpret-trailers: add options for actions
 + trailers: introduce struct new_trailer_item
 + trailers: export action enums and corresponding lookup functions

 "git interpret-trailers" learned to take the trailer specifications
 from the command line that overrides the configured values.


* po/object-id (2017-08-20) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-23 at 0faff383a8)
 + sha1_file: convert index_stream to struct object_id
 + sha1_file: convert hash_sha1_file_literally to struct object_id
 + sha1_file: convert index_fd to struct object_id
 + sha1_file: convert index_path to struct object_id
 + read-cache: convert to struct object_id
 + builtin/hash-object: convert to struct object_id

 Conversion from uchar[20] to struct object_id continues.


* sb/diff-color-move (2017-06-30) 26 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-19 at a239d031bc)
 + diff: document the new --color-moved setting
 + diff.c: add dimming to moved line detection
 + diff.c: color moved lines differently, plain mode
 + diff.c: color moved lines differently
 + diff.c: buffer all output if asked to
 + diff.c: emit_diff_symbol learns about DIFF_SYMBOL_SUMMARY
 + diff.c: emit_diff_symbol learns about DIFF_SYMBOL_STAT_SEP
 + diff.c: convert word diffing to use emit_diff_symbol
 + diff.c: convert show_stats to use emit_diff_symbol
 + diff.c: convert emit_binary_diff_body to use emit_diff_symbol
 + submodule.c: migrate diff output to use emit_diff_symbol
 + diff.c: emit_diff_symbol learns DIFF_SYMBOL_REWRITE_DIFF
 + diff.c: emit_diff_symbol learns about DIFF_SYMBOL_BINARY_FILES
 + diff.c: emit_diff_symbol learns DIFF_SYMBOL_HEADER
 + diff.c: emit_diff_symbol learns DIFF_SYMBOL_FILEPAIR_{PLUS, MINUS}
 + diff.c: emit_diff_symbol learns DIFF_SYMBOL_CONTEXT_INCOMPLETE
 + diff.c: emit_diff_symbol learns DIFF_SYMBOL_WORDS[_PORCELAIN]
 + diff.c: migrate emit_line_checked to use emit_diff_symbol
 + diff.c: emit_diff_symbol learns DIFF_SYMBOL_NO_LF_EOF
 + diff.c: emit_diff_symbol learns DIFF_SYMBOL_CONTEXT_FRAGINFO
 + diff.c: emit_diff_symbol learns DIFF_SYMBOL_CONTEXT_MARKER
 + diff.c: introduce emit_diff_symbol
 + diff.c: factor out diff_flush_patch_all_file_pairs
 + diff.c: move line ending check into emit_hunk_header
 + diff.c: readability fix
 + Merge branch 'sb/hashmap-customize-comparison' into sb/diff-color-move
 (this branch is used by jt/diff-color-move-fix.)

 "git diff" has been taught to optionally paint new lines that are
 the same as deleted lines elsewhere differently from genuinely new
 lines.


* tb/apply-with-crlf (2017-08-19) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-22 at f92bf67061)
 + apply: file commited with CRLF should roundtrip diff and apply
 + convert: add SAFE_CRLF_KEEP_CRLF
 (this branch is tangled with jc/apply-with-crlf.)

 "git apply" that is used as a better "patch -p1" failed to apply a
 taken from a file with CRLF line endings to a file with CRLF line
 endings.  The root cause was because it misused convert_to_git()
 that tried to do "safe-crlf" processing by looking at the index
 entry at the same path, which is a nonsense---in that mode, "apply"
 is not working on the data in (or derived from) the index at all.
 This has been fixed.

[New Topics]

* jk/drop-sha1-entry-pos (2017-08-25) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-25 at 7ef03bb281)
 + sha1-lookup: remove sha1_entry_pos() from header file

 Code clean-up.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ls/convert-filter-progress (2017-08-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-25 at ce0bb30e8f)
 + convert: display progress for filtered objects that have been delayed

 The codepath to call external process filter for smudge/clean
 operation learned to show the progress meter.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* mm/send-email-cc-cruft (2017-08-24) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-25 at 65933523ab)
 + send-email: don't use Mail::Address, even if available
 + send-email: fix garbage removal after address

 In addition to "cc: <a@dd.re.ss> # cruft", "cc: a@dd.re.ss # cruft"
 was taught to "git send-email" as a valid way to tell it that it
 needs to also send a carbon copy to <a@dd.re.ss> in the trailer
 section.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* nd/worktree-kill-parse-ref (2017-08-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-25 at a5da82b2ea)
 + branch: fix branch renaming not updating HEADs correctly

 "git branch -M a b" while on a branch that is completely unrelated
 to either branch a or branch b misbehaved when multiple worktree
 was in use.  This has been fixed.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* pc/submodule-helper (2017-08-25) 4 commits
 - submodule: port submodule subcommand 'status' from shell to C
 - submodule: port set_name_rev() from shell to C
 - submodule--helper: introduce for_each_listed_submodule()
 - submodule--helper: introduce get_submodule_displaypath()

 GSoC.


* sb/parse-options-blank-line-before-option-list (2017-08-25) 1 commit
 - usage_with_options: omit double new line on empty option list

 "git worktree" with no option and no subcommand showed too many
 blank lines in its help text, which has been reduced.


* rs/apply-epoch (2017-08-25) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-26 at c2bf5ceca3)
 + apply: remove epoch date from regex

* mg/status-in-progress-info (2017-05-10) 2 commits
 - status --short --inprogress: spell it as --in-progress
 - status: show in-progress info for short status

 "git status" learns an option to report various operations
 (e.g. "merging") that the user is in the middle of.

 - worktree.c: add update_worktree_location()
 - worktree.c: add validate_worktree()

 "git worktree" learned move and remove subcommands.

* sg/clone-refspec-from-command-line-config (2017-06-16) 2 commits
 - Documentation/clone: document ignored configuration variables
 - clone: respect additional configured fetch refspecs during initial fetch
 (this branch is used by sg/remote-no-string-refspecs.)

 "git clone -c var=val" is a way to set configuration variables in
 the resulting repository, but it is more useful to also make these
 variables take effect while the initial clone is happening,
 e.g. these configuration variables could be fetch refspecs.

 Waiting for a response.

 - refs.c: reindent get_submodule_ref_store()
 - refs.c: remove fallback-to-main-store code get_submodule_ref_store()
 - rev-list: expose and document --single-worktree
 - revision.c: --reflog add HEAD reflog from all worktrees

 - revision.c: refactor add_index_objects_to_pending()
 - refs.c: use is_dir_sep() in resolve_gitlink_ref()
 - revision.h: new flag in struct rev_info wrt. worktree-related refs

 "git gc" and friends when multiple worktrees are used off of a
 single repository did not consider the index and per-worktree refs
 of other worktrees as the root for reachability traversal, making
 objects that are in use only in other worktrees to be subject to
 garbage collection.

 "git archive" did not work well with pathspecs and the

 + commit: allocate array using object_id size
 + commit: replace the raw buffer with strbuf in read_graft_line
 + sha1_file: fix definition of null_sha1

 Conversion from uchar[20] to struct object_id continues; this is to
 ensure that we do not assume sizeof(struct object_id) is the same
 as the length of SHA-1 hash (or length of longest hash we support).

 Will merge to 'master'.


* mk/diff-delta-uint-may-be-shorter-than-ulong (2017-08-10) 1 commit
 . diff-delta: fix encoding size that would not fit in "unsigned int"

 The machinery to create xdelta used in pack files received the
 sizes of the data in size_t, but lost the higher bits of them by
 storing them in "unsigned int" during the computation, which is
 fixed.

 Dropped, as it was rerolled for review as part of a larger series.
 cf. <1502914591-26215-1-git-send-email-martin@mail.zuhause>


* jk/drop-ancient-curl (2017-08-09) 5 commits

 - curl: remove ifdef'd code never used with curl >=7.19.4
 - http: drop support for curl < 7.19.4
 - http: drop support for curl < 7.16.0
 - http: drop support for curl < 7.11.1

 Some code in http.c that has bitrot is being removed.

 Will be rerolled after tc/curl-with-backports stabilizes.


* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2017-08-10) 1 commit
 . zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

 Dropped, as it was rerolled for review as part of a larger series.

* mk/diff-delta-avoid-large-offset (2017-08-11) 1 commit
 . diff-delta: do not allow delta offset truncation

 The delta format used in the packfile cannot reference data at
 offset larger than what can be expressed in 4-byte, but the
 generator for the data failed to make sure the offset does not
 overflow.  This has been corrected.

 "make style" runs git-clang-format to help developers by pointing
 out coding style issues.


* sb/submodule-recursive-checkout-detach-head (2017-07-28) 2 commits
 - Documentation/checkout: clarify submodule HEADs to be detached
 - recursive submodules: detach HEAD from new state

 "git checkout --recursive" may overwrite and rewind the history of
 the branch that happens to be checked out in submodule
 repositories, which might not be desirable.  Detach the HEAD but
 still allow the recursive checkout to succeed in such a case.

 Undecided.
 This needs justification in a larger picture; it is unclear why
 this is better than rejecting recursive checkout, for example.

 + sha1dc: allow building with the external sha1dc library
 + sha1dc: build git plumbing code more explicitly

 Platforms that ship with a separate sha1 with collision detection
 library can link to it instead of using the copy we ship as part of
 our source tree.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 - push: disable lazy --force-with-lease by default

 Because "git push --force-with-lease[=<ref>]" that relies on the
 stability of remote-tracking branches is unsafe when something
 fetches into the repository behind user's back, it is now disabled
 by default.  A new configuration variable can be used to enable it
 by users who know what they are doing.  This would pave the way to
 possibly turn `--force` into `--force-with-lease`.

 Will discard.
 Independent from disabling the feature by default, this stirred up
 a discussion to replace the DWIM heuristics with a better one, which
 deserves to be its own topic.

 + pathspec: die on empty strings as pathspec
 + t0027: do not use an empty string as a pathspec element

 The final step to make an empty string as a pathspec element
 illegal.  We started this by first deprecating and warning a
 pathspec that has such an element in 2.11 (Nov 2016).

 Hopefully we can merge this down to the 'master' by the end of the
 year?  A deprecation warning period that is about 1 year does not
 sound too bad.

 Will cook in 'next'.
 As the draft RelNotes says, let's merge this to 'master' after
 this release cycle.

 - branch: add a --copy (-c) option to go with --move (-m)
 - branch: add test for -m renaming multiple config sections
 - config: create a function to format section headers

 "git branch" learned "-c/-C" to create and switch to a new branch
 by copying an existing one.

 I personally do not think "branch --copy master backup" while on
 "master" that switches to "backup" is a good UI, and I *will* say
 "I told you so" when users complain after we merge this down to
 'master'.
