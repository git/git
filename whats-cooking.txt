What's cooking in git.git (Sep 2014, #02; Tue, 9)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.

The second batch of topics have graduated to 'master'.  There are
too many topics waiting to be in 'next' but without comments and
reviews on the list, which is somewhat disturbing.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

[Graduated to "master"]

* bc/imap-send-doc (2014-08-05) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-08-29 at 2ea514b)
 + imap-send doc: omit confusing "to use imap-send" modifier


* jc/apply-ws-prefix (2014-08-07) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-08-29 at 67967d3)
 + apply: omit ws check for excluded paths
 + apply: hoist use_patch() helper for path exclusion up
 + apply: use the right attribute for paths in non-Git patches

 Applying a patch not generated by Git in a subdirectory used to
 check the whitespace breakage using the attributes for incorrect
 paths. Also whitespace checks were performed even for paths
 excluded via "git apply --exclude=<path>" mechanism.


* jc/config-mak-document-darwin-vs-macosx (2014-08-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-08-29 at 55e28af)
 + config.mak.uname: add hint on uname_R for MacOS X
 (this branch uses km/no-apple-common-crypto-on-darwin-8-and-below.)


* jc/not-mingw-cygwin (2014-07-21) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-08-29 at 0d00bb7)
 + test prerequisites: enumerate with commas
 + test prerequisites: eradicate NOT_FOO

 We have been using NOT_{MINGW,CYGWIN} test prerequisites long
 before Peff invented support for negated prerequisites e.g. !MINGW
 and we still add more uses of the former.  Convert them to the
 latter to avoid confusion.


* jk/command-line-config-empty-string (2014-08-05) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-08-29 at 74f04af)
 + config: teach "git -c" to recognize an empty string

 "git -c section.var command" and "git -c section.var= command"
 should pass the configuration differently (the former should be
 a boolean true, the latter should be an empty string).


* jk/prompt-stash-could-be-packed (2014-08-25) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-08-29 at 526e3bd)
 + git-prompt: do not look for refs/stash in $GIT_DIR

 The prompt script checked $GIT_DIR/ref/stash file to see if there
 is a stash, which was a no-no.


* jk/stash-list-p (2014-08-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-08-29 at db94527)
 + stash: default listing to working-tree diff

 Teach "git stash list -p" to show the difference between the base
 commit version and the working tree version, which is in line with
 what "git show" gives.


* km/no-apple-common-crypto-on-darwin-8-and-below (2014-08-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-08-29 at 8abb416)

* lf/bundle-exclusion (2014-08-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-08-29 at d84b102)
 + bundle: fix exclusion of annotated tags

 "git bundle create" with date-range specification were meant to
 exclude tags outside the range, but it didn't.


* mm/log-branch-desc-plug-leak (2014-08-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-08-29 at 3580add)

* rs/refresh-beyond-symlink (2014-08-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-08-29 at 90a4a8b)
 + read-cache: check for leading symlinks when refreshing index

 "git add x" where x that used to be a directory has become a
 symbolic link to a directory misbehaved.

  (merged to 'next' on 2014-08-29 at fb82508)
 + prepare_revision_walk(): check for return value in all places


* so/rebase-doc (2014-08-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-08-29 at 77cfce1)
 + Documentation/git-rebase.txt: -f forces a rebase that would otherwise be a no-op

 May need further updates to the description to explain what makes
 various modes of operation to decide that the request can become a
 "no-op".

  (merged to 'next' on 2014-08-29 at 8390945)
 + imap-send: create target mailbox if it is missing
 + imap-send: clarify CRAM-MD5 vs LOGIN documentation

 - userdiff: support Java try keyword
 - userdiff: support C# async methods and correct C# keywords

 Reviews sent; waiting for a response.


* bg/rebase-off-of-previous-branch (2014-04-16) 1 commit
 - git-rebase: print name of rev when using shorthand

 Teach "git rebase -" to report the concrete name of the branch
 (i.e. the previous one).

 But it stops short and does not do the same for "git rebase @{-1}".
 Expecting a reroll.


* jk/makefile (2014-02-05) 16 commits
 . FIXUP
 . move LESS/LV pager environment to Makefile

 Expecting a reroll.


* po/everyday-doc (2014-01-27) 1 commit
 - Make 'git help everyday' work

 This may make the said command to emit something, but the source is
 not meant to be formatted into a manual pages to begin with, and
 also its contents are a bit stale.  It may be a good first step in
 the right direction, but needs more work to at least get the
 mark-up right before public consumption.

 Waiting for a reroll (thread ending at $gmane/254746)


* rb/merge-prepare-commit-msg-hook (2014-01-10) 4 commits
 - merge: drop unused arg from abort_commit method signature
 - merge: make prepare_to_commit responsible for write_merge_state
 - t7505: ensure cleanup after hook blocks merge
 - t7505: add missing &&

 Expose more merge states (e.g. $GIT_DIR/MERGE_MODE) to hooks that
 run during "git merge".  The log message stresses too much on one
 hook, prepare-commit-msg, but it would equally apply to other hooks
 like post-merge, I think.

 Waiting for a reroll.


* jc/graph-post-root-gap (2013-12-30) 3 commits
 - WIP: document what we want at the end
 - graph: remove unused code a bit
 - graph: stuff the current commit into graph->columns[]

 - perf-lib: add test_perf_cleanup target
 - perf-lib: split starting the test from the execution

 Add test_perf_cleanup shell function to the perf suite, that allows
 the script writers to define a test with a clean-up action.

 Will hold.


* jc/show-branch (2014-03-24) 5 commits
 - show-branch: use commit slab to represent bitflags of arbitrary width
 - show-branch.c: remove "all_mask"
 - show-branch.c: abstract out "flags" operation
 - show-branch.c: lift all_mask/all_revs to a global static
 - show-branch.c: update comment style

 Waiting for the final step to lift the hard-limit before sending it out.

 - name-hash: allow dir hashing even when !ignore_case
 - merge-recursive: allow storing conflict hunks in index

 - merge-recursive: -Xindex-only to leave worktree unchanged
 - merge-recursive: internal flag to avoid touching the worktree
 - merge-recursive: remove dead conditional in update_stages()

 "log -p" output learns a new way to let users inspect a merge
 commit by showing the differences between the automerged result
 with conflicts the person who recorded the merge would have seen
 and the final conflict resolution that was recorded in the merge.

 Review comments sent.

* bb/date-iso-strict (2014-08-29) 1 commit
 - pretty: provide a strict ISO 8601 date format

 "log --date=iso" uses a slight variant of ISO 8601 format that is
 made more human readable.  A new "--date=iso-strict" option gives
 datetime output that is more strictly conformant.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/commit-author-parsing (2014-08-29) 6 commits
 - determine_author_info(): copy getenv output
 - determine_author_info(): reuse parsing functions

 + subtree: make "all" default target of Makefile

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/fast-export-anonymize (2014-08-28) 2 commits
 - docs/fast-export: explain --anonymize more completely
 - teach fast-export an --anonymize option

 Sometimes users want to report a bug they experience on their
 repository, but they are not at liberty to share the contents of
 the repository.  "fast-export" was taught an "--anonymize" option
 to replace blob contents, names of people and paths and log
 messages with bland and simple strings to help them.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/index-pack-threading-races (2014-08-29) 1 commit
 - index-pack: fix race condition with duplicate bases

 When receiving an invalid pack stream that records the same object
 twice, multiple threads got confused due to a race.  We should
 reject or correct such a stream upon receiving, but that will be a
 larger change.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/send-pack-many-refspecs (2014-08-26) 1 commit
 - send-pack: take refspecs over stdin

 The number of refs that can be pushed at once over smart HTTP was
 limited by the command line length.  The limitation has been lifted
 by passing these refs from the standard input of send-pack.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jp/index-with-corrupt-stages (2014-08-29) 2 commits
 - read_index_unmerged(): remove unnecessary loop index adjustment
 - read_index_from(): catch out of order entries when reading an index file

 A broken reimplementation of Git could write an invalid index that
 records both stage #0 and higher stage entries for the same path.
 Notice and reject such an index, as there is no sensible fallback
 (we do not know if the broken tool wanted to resolve and forgot to
 remove higher stage entries, or if it wanted to unresolve and
 forgot to remove the stage#0 entry).

 Will merge to 'next'.


* mb/build-contrib-svn-fe (2014-08-28) 1 commit
 - contrib/svn-fe: fix Makefile

 Will merge to 'next'.


* mb/fast-import-delete-root (2014-08-29) 2 commits
 - fast-import: fix segfault in store_tree()
 - t9300: test filedelete command

 An attempt to remove the entire tree in the "git fast-import" input
 stream caused it to misbehave.

 Will merge to 'next'.

  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-03 at 5be5957)
 + upload-pack: keep poll(2)'s timeout to -1

 We used to pass -1000 to poll(2), expecting it to also mean "no
 timeout", which should be spelled as -1.

* jk/make-simplify-dependencies (2014-08-26) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-03 at 820a600)
 + Makefile: drop CHECK_HEADER_DEPENDENCIES code
 + Makefile: use `find` to determine static header dependencies
 + i18n: treat "make pot" as an explicitly-invoked target

 Admit that keeping LIB_H up-to-date, only for those that do not use
 the automatically generated dependencies, is a losing battle, and
 make it conservative by making everything depend on anything.

* jk/prune-top-level-refs-after-packing (2014-08-25) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-04 at bfe3873)

 After "pack-refs --prune" packed refs at the top-level, it failed
 to prune them.

* jk/fast-import-fixes (2014-08-25) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-04 at 74838e5)
 + fast-import: fix buffer overflow in dump_tags
 + fast-import: clean up pack_data pointer in end_packfile

 With sufficiently long refnames, fast-import could have overflown
 an on-stack buffer.

 + log-tree: use FLEX_ARRAY in name_decoration
 + log-tree: make name_decoration hash static
 + log-tree: make add_name_decoration a public function

 The API to allocate the structure to keep track of commit
 decoration was cumbersome to use, inviting lazy code to
 overallocate memory.

 + checkout -m: attempt merge when deletion of path was staged
 + unpack-trees: use 'cuddled' style for if-else cascade
 + unpack-trees: simplify 'all other failures' case

 "git checkout -m" did not switch to another branch while carrying
 the local changes forward when a path was deleted from the index.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 + diff.c: allow to pass more flags to diff_populate_filespec
 + sha1_file.c: do not die failing to malloc in unpack_compressed_entry

 Teach a few codepaths to punt (instead of dying) when large blobs
 that would not fit in core are involved in the operation.

 tips of branches at a public repository really point the commits
 the pusher wanted to, without having to "trust" the server.

 Hopefully a final reroll.  Comments & reviews?

* mt/patch-id-stable (2014-06-10) 1 commit
 - patch-id: change default to stable

 Teaches "git patch-id" to compute the patch ID that does not change
 when the files in a single patch is reordered. As this new algorithm
 is backward incompatible, the last bit to flip it to be the default
 is left out of 'master' for now.

 Nobody seems to be jumping up & down requesting this last step.
 Perhaps will drop.
