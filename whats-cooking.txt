What's cooking in git.git (Nov 2023, #07; Fri, 17)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and
aren't considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL
to a message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity (of course they can be resubmit when new interests
arise).

Git 2.43-rc2 has been tagged.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

[New Topics]

* jw/builtin-objectmode-attr (2023-11-16) 2 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - attr: add builtin objectmode values support

 The builtin_objectmode attribute is populated for each path
 without adding anything in .gitattributes files, which would be
 useful in magic pathspec, e.g., ":(attr:builtin_objectmode=100755)"
 to limit to executables.

 - refs: deduplicate code to delete references
 - refs/files: use transactions to delete references
 - t5510: ensure that the packed-refs file needs locking

 Simplify API implementation to delete references by eliminating
 duplication.

 + perl: bump the required Perl version to 5.8.1 from 5.8.0

 Newer versions of Getopt::Long started giving warnings against our
 (ab)use of it in "git send-email".  Bump the minimum version
 requirement for Perl to 5.8.1 (from September 2002) to allow
 simplifying our implementation.

* pw/rebase-sigint (2023-09-07) 1 commit
 - rebase -i: ignore signals when forking subprocesses

 If the commit log editor or other external programs (spawned via
 "exec" insn in the todo list) receive internactive signal during
 "git rebase -i", it caused not just the spawned program but the
 "Git" process that spawned them, which is often not what the end
 user intended.  "git" learned to ignore SIGINT and SIGQUIT while
 waiting for these subprocesses.

 Expecting a reroll.

 clobbering local modification, but "git cherry-pick A..B" did not,
 which has been corrected.
