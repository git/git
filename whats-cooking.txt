What's cooking in git.git (Mar 2013, #08; Fri, 29)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.

A handful of topics that have been stalled for quite a while have
been discarded; for those that are not superseded by something else,
interested parties can still resubmit a reroll, but without any
advances, we do not get any benefit from carrying them in my tree.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* ap/combine-diff-ignore-whitespace (2013-03-14) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-19 at dfb2c98)
 + Allow combined diff to ignore white-spaces
 (this branch is used by ap/combine-diff-coalesce-lost.)

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-03-18

 Teach "diff --cc" output to honor options to ignore various forms
 of whitespace changes.


* jc/remove-treesame-parent-in-simplify-merges (2013-01-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-26 at 7999dbe)
 + simplify-merges: drop merge from irrelevant side branch

 The --simplify-merges logic did not cull irrelevant parents from a
 merge that is otherwise not interesting with respect to the paths
 we are following.

 This touches a fairly core part of the revision traversal
 infrastructure; even though I think this change is correct, please
 report immediately if you find any unintended side effect.


* jk/checkout-attribute-lookup (2013-03-20) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-20 at 43a89e8)
 + t2003: work around path mangling issue on Windows
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-19 at b063a55)
 + entry: fix filter lookup
 + t2003: modernize style

 Codepath to stream blob object contents directly from the object
 store to filesystem did not use the correct path to find conversion
 filters when writing to temporary files.


* jk/difftool-dir-diff-edit-fix (2013-03-14) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-19 at e68014a)
 + difftool --dir-diff: symlink all files matching the working tree
 + difftool: avoid double slashes in symlink targets
 + git-difftool(1): fix formatting of --symlink description

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-03-15

 "git difftool --dir-diff" made symlinks to working tree files when
 preparing a temporary directory structure, so that accidental edits
 of these files in the difftool are reflected back to the working
 tree, but the logic to decide when to do so was not quite right.


* kk/revwalk-slop-too-many-commit-within-a-second (2013-03-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-26 at ea90e75)
 + Fix revision walk for commits with the same dates

 Allow the revision "slop" code to look deeper while commits with
 exactly the same timestamps come next to each other (which can
 often happen after a large "am" and "rebase" session).


* rr/tests-dedup-test-config (2013-03-19) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-26 at d314299)
 + t4018,7810,7811: remove test_config() redefinition


* rs/archive-zip-raw-compression (2013-03-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-19 at 8cc1cb3)
 + archive-zip: use deflateInit2() to ask for raw compressed data

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-03-18


* yd/doc-is-in-asciidoc (2013-03-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-26 at a980af2)
 + CodingGuidelines: our documents are in AsciiDoc


* yd/doc-merge-annotated-tag (2013-03-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-26 at a11162f)
 + Documentation: merging a tag is a special case

 Document the 1.7.9 feature to merge a signed tag and keep that in
 the mergetag header in the resulting commit better.


* yd/use-test-config-unconfig (2013-03-25) 12 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-26 at 55b69a9)
 + t7600: use test_config to set/unset git config variables
 + t7502: remove clear_config
 + t7502: use test_config to set/unset git config variables
 + t9500: use test_config to set/unset git config variables
 + t7508: use test_config to set/unset git config variables
 + t7500: use test_config to set/unset git config variables
 + t5541: use test_config to set/unset git config variables
 + t5520: use test_config to set/unset git config variables
 + t4202: use test_config/test_unconfig to set/unset git config variables
 + t4034: use test_config/test_unconfig to set/unset git config variables
 + t4304: use test_config to set/unset git config variables
 + t3400: use test_config to set/unset git config variables

 Bulk-update of the test suite.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* js/log-gpg (2013-03-27) 1 commit
 - log: read gpg settings for signed commit verification

 Teach "show/log" honor gpg.program configuration just like other
 parts of the code that use GnuPG.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jc/t5516-pushInsteadOf-vs-pushURL (2013-03-28) 1 commit
 - t5516: test interaction between pushURL and pushInsteadOf correctly

 Update a test to match the documented interaction between pushURL
 and pushInsteadOf.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/merge-tree-added-identically (2013-03-27) 1 commit
 - merge-tree: fix "same file added in subdir"

 We would most likely want to change things the other way around.


* rr/triangle (2013-03-28) 6 commits
 - remote.c: introduce branch.<name>.pushremote
 - remote.c: introduce remote.pushdefault
 - remote.c: introduce a way to have different remotes for fetch/push
 - t5516 (fetch-push): drop implicit arguments from helper functions
 - t5516 (fetch-push): update test description
 - remote.c: simplify a bit of code using git_config_string()

 Support "pull from one place, push to another place" workflow
 better by introducing remote.pushdefault (overrides the "origin"
 thing) and branch.*.pushremote (overrides the branch.*.remote).


* sg/gpg-sig (2013-03-29) 5 commits
 - pretty printing: extend %G? to include 'N' and 'U'
 - merge/pull Check for untrusted good GPG signatures
 - merge/pull: verify GPG signatures of commits being merged
 - commit.c: also look at the first GPG status line
 - Move commit GPG signature verification to commit.c

 Teach "merge/pull" to optionally verify and reject commits that are
 not signed properly.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* tr/log-tree-optim (2013-03-28) 1 commit
 - Avoid loading commits twice in log with diffs

 Optimize "log" that shows the difference between the parent and the
 child.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/config-with-empty-section (2013-03-29) 1 commit
 - t1300: document some aesthetic failures of the config editor

 Document that "git config --unset" does not remove an empty section
 head after removing the last variable in a section, and adding a
 new variable does not try to reuse a leftover empty section head.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/difftool-no-overwrite-on-copyback (2013-03-29) 5 commits
 - t7800: run --dir-diff tests with and without symlinks
 - t7800: fix tests when difftool uses --no-symlinks
 - t7800: don't hide grep output
 - difftool: don't overwrite modified files
 - t7800: move '--symlinks' specific test to the end

 Try to be careful when difftool backend allows the user to write
 into the temporary files being shown *and* the user makes changes
 to the working tree at the same time. One of the changes has to be
 lost in such a case, but at least tell the user what he did.



--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* jc/format-patch (2013-02-21) 2 commits
 - format-patch: --inline-single
 - format-patch: rename "no_inline" field

 A new option to send a single patch to the standard output to be
 appended at the bottom of a message.  I personally have no need for
 this, but it was easy enough to cobble together.  Tests, docs and
 stripping out more MIMEy stuff are left as exercises to interested
 parties.

 Not ready for inclusion.

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* jc/apply-ws-fix-tab-in-indent (2013-03-29) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-29 at 26eb6e9)
 + test: resurrect q_to_tab
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-26 at 46c6bda)
 + apply --whitespace=fix: avoid running over the postimage buffer

 "git apply --whitespace=fix" was not prepared to see a line getting
 longer after fixing whitespaces (e.g. tab-in-indent aka Python).

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/no-more-self-assignment (2013-03-25) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-26 at 31ec9ac)
 + match-trees: simplify score_trees() using tree_entry()
 + submodule: clarify logic in show_submodule_summary

 This started as a topic to reduce "type var = var" self assignment
 tricks that were used to squelch "variable used uninitialized perhaps?"
 warning from some compilers, but resulted in rewriting logic with
 a version that is simpler and easier to understand for humans.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ap/combine-diff-coalesce-lost (2013-03-25) 1 commit
 - combine-diff: coalesce lost lines optimally

 Attempts to minimize "diff -c/--cc" output by coalescing the same
 lines removed from the parents better, but with an O(n^2)
 complexity.

 Will merge to 'next' to see if people with real-world usage scream.


* bk/document-commit-tree-S (2013-03-25) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-26 at 8ee205f)
 + commit-tree: document -S option consistently

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/check-corrupt-objects-carefully (2013-03-27) 10 commits
 - clone: leave repo in place after checkout errors
 - clone: run check_everything_connected
 - clone: die on errors from unpack_trees
 - add tests for cloning corrupted repositories
 - streaming_write_entry: propagate streaming errors
 - add test for streaming corrupt blobs
 - avoid infinite loop in read_istream_loose
 - read_istream_filtered: propagate read error from upstream
 - check_sha1_signature: check return value from read_istream
 - stream_blob_to_fd: detect errors reading from stream

 Have the streaming interface and other codepaths more carefully
 examine for corrupt objects.

 The message in the last one may want to be updated.
 $gmane/219229


* js/iterm-is-on-osx (2013-03-25) 1 commit
 - git-web--browse: recognize iTerm as a GUI terminal on OS X

 Add more logic to detect graphic environment of OS X.

 We may want to simplify it down to just "is there TERM_PROGRAM?",
 but I am not an OS X user.


* tb/cygwin-shared-repository (2013-03-25) 1 commit
 - Make core.sharedRepository work under cygwin 1.7

 Cygwin port has a faster-but-lying lstat(2) emulation whose
 incorrectness does not matter in practice except for a few
 codepaths, and setting permission bits to directories is a codepath
 that needs to use a more correct one.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jc/directory-attrs-regression-fix (2013-03-28) 6 commits
 - t: check that a pattern without trailing slash matches a directory
 - dir.c::match_pathname(): pay attention to the length of string parameters
 - dir.c::match_pathname(): adjust patternlen when shifting pattern
 - dir.c::match_basename(): pay attention to the length of string parameters
 - attr.c::path_matches(): special case paths that end with a slash
 - attr.c::path_matches(): the basename is part of the pathname

 Fix 1.8.1.x regression that stopped matching "dir" (without
 trailing slash) to a directory "dir".

 Will merge to 'next'.


* nd/checkout-paths-reduce-match-pathspec-calls (2013-03-27) 1 commit
 - checkout: avoid unnecessary match_pathspec calls

 Consolidate repeated pathspec matches on the same paths, while
 fixing a bug in "git checkout dir/" code started from an unmerged
 index.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jc/merge-tag-object (2013-03-19) 1 commit
 - merge: a random object may not necssarily be a commit

 "git merge $(git rev-parse v1.8.2)" behaved quite differently from
 "git merge v1.8.2" as if v1.8.2 were written as v1.8.2^0 and did
 not pay much attention to the annotated tag payload.

 This makes the code notice the type of the tag object, in addition
 to the dwim_ref() based classification the current code uses
 (i.e. the name appears in refs/tags/) to decide when to special
 case merging of tags.

 We may actually want to call the current behaviour a feature,
 though.  After all, the user went to great length to feed something
 different from the normal "v1.8.2" to the command.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/index-pack-correct-depth-fix (2013-03-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-26 at c56e839)
 + index-pack: always zero-initialize object_entry list

 "index-pack --fix-thin" used uninitialize value to compute delta
 depths of objects it appends to the resulting pack.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jn/push-tests (2013-03-19) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-26 at da891db)
 + push test: rely on &&-chaining instead of 'if bad; then echo Oops; fi'
 + push test: simplify check of push result
 + push test: use test_config when appropriate

 Update t5516 with style fixes.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* nd/index-pack-threaded-fixes (2013-03-19) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-26 at e508c77)
 + index-pack: guard nr_resolved_deltas reads by lock
 + index-pack: protect deepest_delta in multithread code

 "index-pack --verify-stat" used a few counters outside protection
 of mutex, possibly showing incorrect numbers.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* kb/status-ignored-optim (2013-03-19) 8 commits
 - dir.c: git-status: avoid is_excluded checks for tracked files
 - dir.c: replace is_path_excluded with now equivalent is_excluded API
 - dir.c: unify is_excluded and is_path_excluded APIs
 - dir.c: move prep_exclude and factor out parts of last_exclude_matching
 - dir.c: git-status --ignored: don't list empty directories as ignored
 - dir.c: git-status --ignored: don't list empty ignored directories
 - dir.c: git-status --ignored: don't list files in ignored directories
 - dir.c: git-status --ignored: don't drop ignored directories

 "git status --ignored" had many corner case bugs.  Also the command
 has been optimized by taking advantage of the fact that paths that
 are already known to the index do not have to be checked against
 the .gitignore mechanism most of the time.

 Expecting a review from others; this codepath is used not only by
 status but also in add and clean, so a bug in it can result in lost
 data.


* jn/add-2.0-u-A-sans-pathspec (2013-03-20) 5 commits
 - git add: -u/-A now affects the entire working tree
 - add -A: only show pathless 'add -A' warning when changes exist outside cwd
 - add -u: only show pathless 'add -u' warning when changes exist outside cwd
 - add: make warn_pathless_add() a no-op after first call
 - add: make pathless 'add [-u|-A]' warning a file-global function

 Replaces jc/add-2.0-u-A-sans-pathspec topic by not warning against
 "add -u/-A" that is ran without pathspec when there is no change
 outside the current directory.

 Expecting a reroll and then merge the bottom bits to 'next'.

* rr/test-3200-style (2013-03-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-26 at 1214287)
 + t3200 (branch): modernize style

 Churns.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* tr/packed-object-info-wo-recursion (2013-03-27) 3 commits
 - sha1_file: remove recursion in unpack_entry
 - Refactor parts of in_delta_base_cache/cache_or_unpack_entry
 - sha1_file: remove recursion in packed_object_info

 Attempts to reduce the stack footprint of sha1_object_info()
 and unpack_entry() codepaths.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sr/am-show-final-message-in-applying-indicator (2013-03-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-26 at 9ecb143)
 + git-am: show the final log message on "Applying:" indicator

 In addition to the case where the user edits the log message with
 the "e)dit" option of "am -i", replace the "Applying: this patch"
 message with the final log message contents after applymsg hook
 munges it.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 Will merge to 'next' after all the dust settles.


* sw/safe-create-leading-dir-race (2013-03-26) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-26 at 744bb50)
 + safe_create_leading_directories: fix race that could give a false negative

 Will merge to 'master'.


* nd/branch-show-rebase-bisect-state (2013-03-23) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-26 at cd666f6)
 + status, branch: fix the misleading "bisecting" message

* jc/add-2.0-delete-default (2013-03-08) 3 commits
 - git add <pathspec>... defaults to "-A"
 - git add: start preparing for "git add <pathspec>..." to default to "-A"
 - builtin/add.c: simplify boolean variables

 "git add dir/" updated modified files and added new files, but does
 not notice removed files, which may be "Huh?" to some users.  They
 can of course use "git add -A dir/", but why should they?

 There seemed to be some interest in this topic, so resurrected and
 rebased on top of recent documentation updates to propose a
 possible transition plan.

 Will cook in 'next' until Git 2.0.


* jc/nobody-sets-src-peer-ref (2013-03-04) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-26 at 9d13c02)
 + match_push_refs(): nobody sets src->peer_ref anymore

 Dead code removal.

 Even though I think this change is correct, please report
 immediately if you find any unintended side effect.

 Will merge to 'master' in the 4th batch (Risky).


* kb/name-hash (2013-02-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-26 at 750490a)
 + name-hash.c: fix endless loop with core.ignorecase=true

 The code to keep track of what directory names are known to Git on
 platforms with case insensitive filesystems can get confused upon
 a hash collision between these pathnames and looped forever.

 Even though I think this change is correct, please report
 immediately if you find any unintended side effect.

 Will merge to 'master' in the 4th batch (Risky).


* tr/line-log (2013-03-28) 5 commits
 - Speed up log -L... -M
 - log -L: :pattern:file syntax to find by funcname
 - Implement line-history search (git log -L)
 - Export rewrite_parents() for 'log -L'
 - Refactor parse_loc

 Rerolled.

 Will merge to 'next'.

  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-26 at 8b7bb16)
 + Makefile: make mandir, htmldir and infodir absolute

 Make the three variables safer to be exported to submakes by
 ensuring that they are full paths so that they can be used as
 installation location.

 Even though I think this change is correct, please report
 immediately if you find any unintended side effect.

 Will merge to 'master' in the 4th batch (Risky).


* jk/pkt-line-cleanup (2013-03-21) 20 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-26 at 2bb3b75)

 Cleans up pkt-line API, implementation and its callers to make them
 more robust.  Even though I think this change is correct, please
 report immediately if you find any unintended side effect.

 Will merge to 'master' in the 3rd batch (Risky).


* jc/remove-export-from-config-mak-in (2013-03-05) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-26 at a789220)
 + Fix `make install` when configured with autoconf
 + Makefile: do not export mandir/htmldir/infodir
 + config.mak.in: remove unused definitions

 config.mak.in template had an "export" line to cause a few
 common makefile variables to be exported; if they need to be
 expoted for autoconf/configure users, they should also be exported
 for people who write config.mak the same way.  Move the "export" to
 the main Makefile.  Also, stop exporting mandir that used to be
 exported (only) when config.mak.autogen was used.  It would have
 broken installation of manpages (but not other documentation
 formats).

 Even though I think this change is correct, please report
 immediately if you find any unintended side effect.

 Will merge to 'master' in the 4th batch (Risky).


* jc/push-2.0-default-to-simple (2013-03-18) 15 commits

 Consolidates codepaths that inspect log-message-to-be and decide to
 add a new Signed-off-by line in various commands.  I think there is
 no negative behaviour change in this series, but please report any
 iffy behaviour change immediately if you notice one.

 Will merge to 'master' in the 3rd batch (Risky).

* nd/read-directory-recursive-optim (2013-02-17) 1 commit
 . read_directory: avoid invoking exclude machinery on tracked files

 "git status" has been optimized by taking advantage of the fact
 that paths that are already known to the index do not have to be
 checked against the .gitignore mechanism under some conditions.
 Even though I think this change is correct, please report
 immediately if you find any unintended side effect.

 kb/status-ignored-optim supersedes this.


* jc/add-2.0-u-A-sans-pathspec (2013-03-14) 1 commit
 . git add: -u/-A now affects the entire working tree

 "git add -u/-A" without pathspec has traditonally limited its
 operation to the current directory and its subdirectories, but in
 Git 1.8.2 we started encouraging users to be more explicit to
 specify "." when they mean it (and use ":/" to make it affect the
 entire working tree).  With this, we finally change the behaviour
 and make it affect the entire working tree in Git 2.0.

 jn/add-2.0-u-A-sans-pathspec supersedes this.


* ja/directory-attrs (2013-03-20) 1 commit
 . trailing slash required in .gitattributes

 Now part of jc/directory-attrs-regression-fix.


* hv/config-from-strbuf (2013-03-10) 4 commits
 . teach config parsing to read from strbuf
 . config: make parsing stack struct independent from actual data source
 . config: drop file pointer validity check in get_next_char()
 . config: factor out config file stack management

* mb/remote-default-nn-origin (2012-07-11) 6 commits
 . Teach get_default_remote to respect remote.default.
 . Test that plain "git fetch" uses remote.default when on a detached HEAD.
 . Teach clone to set remote.default.
 . Teach "git remote" about remote.default.
 . Teach remote.c about the remote.default configuration setting.
 . Rename remote.c's default_remote_name static variables.

 When the user does not specify what remote to interact with, we
 often attempt to use 'origin'.  This can now be customized via a
 configuration variable.

 Was expecting a reroll.

 "The first remote becomes the default" bit is better done as a
 separate step.


* mg/qnx6 (2013-02-25) 1 commit
