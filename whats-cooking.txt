What's cooking in git.git (Aug 2011, #06; Tue, 23)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.

I was very tempted to cut 1.7.7-rc0 today, but we have quite a few topics
that deserve to be in the upcoming release and are still in 'next'.  I'll
probably merge most if not all of what are in 'next' as of today sometime
later this week, tag a 1.7.7-rc0 release and declare feature freeze for
this cycle.

  (merged to 'next' on 2011-08-11 at 8ff9a56)
 + add--interactive: add option to autosplit hunks
 + add--interactive: allow negatation of hunk filters
 + add--interactive: allow hunk filtering on command line
 + add--interactive: factor out regex error handling

Needs documentation updates.

* jc/merge-reword (2011-05-25) 2 commits
 - merge: mark the final "Merge made by..." message for l10n
 - merge: reword the final message

Probably the topmost commit should be dropped.

* nk/branch-v-abbrev (2011-07-01) 1 commit
 - branch -v: honor core.abbrev

Perhaps needs an updated commit log message?

* jh/receive-count-limit (2011-05-23) 10 commits
 - receive-pack: Allow server to refuse pushes with too many objects
 - pack-objects: Estimate pack size; abort early if pack size limit is exceeded
 - send-pack/receive-pack: Allow server to refuse pushing too large packs
 - pack-objects: Allow --max-pack-size to be used together with --stdout
 - send-pack/receive-pack: Allow server to refuse pushes with too many commits
 - pack-objects: Teach new option --max-commit-count, limiting #commits in pack

 - Tighten rules for matching server capabilities in server_supports()
 - send-pack: Attempt to retrieve remote status even if pack-objects fails
 - Update technical docs to reflect side-band-64k capability in receive-pack

Would need another round to separate per-pack and per-session limits.

* jm/mergetool-pathspec (2011-06-22) 2 commits

 - add metadata-cache infrastructure
 - decorate: allow storing values instead of pointers
 - Merge branch 'jk/tag-contains-ab' (early part) into HEAD

The initial "tag --contains" de-pessimization without need for generation
numbers is already in; backburnered.

 - t5800: point out that deleting branches does not work
 - t5800: document inability to push new branch with old content
