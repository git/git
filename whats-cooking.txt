What's cooking in git.git (Aug 2017, #03; Mon, 14)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

The top part of the draft release notes for the next cycle, which I
tentatively called Git 2.15, declares that "git add ''" will still
be supported up to this release but will become illegal after that.
Given that a typical release cycle is 8-12 weeks, that will happen
sometime early next year.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

[Graduated to "master"]

* ah/doc-wserrorhighlight (2017-07-25) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-27 at cd1bb28d95)
 + doc: add missing values "none" and "default" for diff.wsErrorHighlight

 Doc update.


* bc/object-id (2017-07-17) 12 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-18 at fd161056e4)
 + sha1_name: convert uses of 40 to GIT_SHA1_HEXSZ
 + sha1_name: convert GET_SHA1* flags to GET_OID*
 + sha1_name: convert get_sha1* to get_oid*
 + Convert remaining callers of get_sha1 to get_oid.
 + builtin/unpack-file: convert to struct object_id
 + bisect: convert bisect_checkout to struct object_id
 + builtin/update_ref: convert to struct object_id
 + sequencer: convert to struct object_id
 + remote: convert struct push_cas to struct object_id
 + submodule: convert submodule config lookup to use object_id
 + builtin/merge-tree: convert remaining caller of get_sha1 to object_id
 + builtin/fsck: convert remaining caller of get_sha1 to object_id
 (this branch is used by bw/submodule-config-cleanup; uses sb/object-id.)

 Conversion from uchar[20] to struct object_id continues.


* bw/object-id (2017-07-17) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-18 at 90d27c0e7c)
 + receive-pack: don't access hash of NULL object_id pointer
 + notes: don't access hash of NULL object_id pointer
 + tree-diff: don't access hash of NULL object_id pointer

 Conversion from uchar[20] to struct object_id continues.


* cc/ref-is-hidden-microcleanup (2017-07-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-27 at 37af544e1c)
 + refs: use skip_prefix() in ref_is_hidden()

 Code cleanup.


* dc/fmt-merge-msg-microcleanup (2017-07-25) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-27 at 6df06eb788)
 + fmt-merge-msg: fix coding style

 Code cleanup.


* dl/credential-cache-socket-in-xdg-cache (2017-07-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-01 at 87687ae1d4)
 + credential-cache: interpret an ECONNRESET as an EOF

 A recently added test for the "credential-cache" helper revealed
 that EOF detection done around the time the connection to the cache
 daemon is torn down were flaky.  This was fixed by reacting to
 ECONNRESET and behaving as if we got an EOF.


* eb/contacts-reported-by (2017-07-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-01 at cca9972d6b)
 + git-contacts: also recognise "Reported-by:"

 "git contacts" (in contrib/) now lists the address on the
 "Reported-by:" trailer to its output, in addition to those on
 S-o-b: and other trailers, to make it easier to notify (and thank)
 the original bug reporter.


* hb/gitweb-project-list (2017-07-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-27 at c25d65ca25)
 + gitweb: skip unreadable subdirectories

 When a directory is not readable, "gitweb" fails to build the
 project list.  Work this around by skipping such a directory.

 It might end up hiding a problem under the rug and a better
 solution might be to loudly complain to the administrator pointing
 out the problematic directory, but this will at least make it
 "work".


* jb/t8008-cleanup (2017-07-26) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-01 at f979c9340d)
 + t8008: rely on rev-parse'd HEAD instead of sha1 value

 Code clean-up.


* jc/http-sslkey-and-ssl-cert-are-paths (2017-07-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-20 at 5489304b99)
 + http.c: http.sslcert and http.sslkey are both pathnames

 The http.{sslkey,sslCert} configuration variables are to be
 interpreted as a pathname that honors "~[username]/" prefix, but
 weren't, which has been fixed.


* jk/c99 (2017-07-18) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-18 at 1cfc30f7c1)
 + clean.c: use designated initializer
 + strbuf: use designated initializers in STRBUF_INIT

 Start using selected c99 constructs in small, stable and
 essentialpart of the system to catch people who care about
 older compilers that do not grok them.


* jk/ref-filter-colors (2017-07-13) 15 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-18 at 75d4eb7ecf)
 + ref-filter: consult want_color() before emitting colors
 + pretty: respect color settings for %C placeholders
 + rev-list: pass diffopt->use_colors through to pretty-print
 + for-each-ref: load config earlier
 + color: check color.ui in git_default_config()
 + ref-filter: pass ref_format struct to atom parsers
 + ref-filter: factor out the parsing of sorting atoms
 + ref-filter: make parse_ref_filter_atom a private function
 + ref-filter: provide a function for parsing sort options
 + ref-filter: move need_color_reset_at_eol into ref_format
 + ref-filter: abstract ref format into its own struct
 + ref-filter: simplify automatic color reset
 + t: use test_decode_color rather than literal ANSI codes
 + docs/for-each-ref: update pointer to color syntax
 + check return value of verify_ref_format()

 "%C(color name)" in the pretty print format always produced ANSI
 color escape codes, which was an early design mistake.  They now
 honor the configuration (e.g. "color.ui = never") and also tty-ness
 of the output medium.


* jk/reflog-walk (2017-07-09) 9 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-09 at 7449e964c6)
 + reflog-walk: apply --since/--until to reflog dates
 + reflog-walk: stop using fake parents
 + rev-list: check reflog_info before showing usage
 + get_revision_1(): replace do-while with an early return
 + log: do not free parents when walking reflog
 + log: clarify comment about reflog cycles
 + revision: disallow reflog walking with revs->limited
 + t1414: document some reflog-walk oddities
 + Merge branch 'jk/reflog-walk-maint' into jk/reflog-walk

 Numerous bugs in walking of reflogs via "log -g" and friends have
 been fixed.


* jk/rev-list-empty-input (2017-08-02) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-04 at cb4f9b84e0)
 + revision: do not fallback to default when rev_input_given is set
 + rev-list: don't show usage when we see empty ref patterns
 + revision: add rev_input_given flag
 + t6018: flesh out empty input/output rev-list tests

 "git log --tag=no-such-tag" showed log starting from HEAD, which
 has been fixed---it now shows nothing.


* js/git-gui-msgfmt-on-windows (2017-07-25) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-01 at 219577a73e)
 + Merge branch 'js/msgfmt-on-windows' of ../git-gui into js/git-gui-msgfmt-on-windows
 + git-gui (MinGW): make use of MSys2's msgfmt
 + Merge remote-tracking branch 'philoakley/dup-gui'
 + git gui: allow for a long recentrepo list
 + git gui: de-dup selected repo from recentrepo history
 + git gui: cope with duplicates in _get_recentrepo
 + git-gui: remove duplicate entries from .gitconfig's gui.recentrepo

 Because recent Git for Windows do come with a real msgfmt, the
 build procedure for git-gui has been updated to use it instead of a
 hand-rolled substitute.


* js/run-process-parallel-api-fix (2017-07-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-27 at 4b54b69172)
 + run_processes_parallel: change confusing task_cb convention

 API fix.


* jt/fsck-code-cleanup (2017-07-26) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-26 at 7a17e279da)
 + fsck: cleanup unused variable
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-20 at f7045a8c47)
 + object: remove "used" field from struct object
 + fsck: remove redundant parse_tree() invocation

 Code clean-up.


* jt/subprocess-handshake (2017-07-26) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-01 at a0f78deffd)
 + sub-process: refactor handshake to common function
 + Documentation: migrate sub-process docs to header
 + Merge branch 'ls/filter-process-delayed' into jt/subprocess-handshake
 (this branch uses ls/filter-process-delayed.)

 Code cleanup.


* jt/t1450-fsck-corrupt-packfile (2017-07-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-04 at 44d09da2fc)
 + tests: ensure fsck fails on corrupt packfiles

 A test update.


* ks/commit-abort-on-empty-message-fix (2017-07-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-27 at e81ad4c1dc)
 + commit: check for empty message before the check for untouched template

 "git commit" when seeing an totally empty message said "you did not
 edit the message", which is clearly wrong.  The message has been
 corrected.


* ks/prepare-commit-msg-sample (2017-07-12) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-18 at 48d9650a30)
 + hook: add a simple first example
 + hook: add sign-off using "interpret-trailers"
 + hook: name the positional variables
 + hook: cleanup script

 Remove an example that is now obsolete from a sample hook,
 and improve an old example in it that added a sign-off manually
 to use the interpret-trailers command.


* ls/filter-process-delayed (2017-06-30) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-05 at a35e644082)
 + convert: add "status=delayed" to filter process protocol
 + convert: refactor capabilities negotiation
 + convert: move multiple file filter error handling to separate function
 + convert: put the flags field before the flag itself for consistent style
 + t0021: write "OUT <size>" only on success
 + t0021: make debug log file name configurable
 + t0021: keep filter log files on comparison
 (this branch is used by jt/subprocess-handshake.)

 The filter-process interface learned to allow a process with long
 latency give a "delayed" response.


* ma/pager-per-subcommand-action (2017-08-03) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-04 at 0f760bcf5d)
 + git.c: ignore pager.* when launching builtin as dashed external
 + tag: change default of `pager.tag` to "on"
 + tag: respect `pager.tag` in list-mode only
 + t7006: add tests for how git tag paginates
 + git.c: provide setup_auto_pager()
 + git.c: let builtins opt for handling `pager.foo` themselves
 + builtin.h: take over documentation from api-builtin.txt

 The "tag.pager" configuration variable was useless for those who
 actually create tag objects, as it interfered with the use of an
 editor.  A new mechanism has been introduced for commands to enable
 pager depending on what operation is being carried out to fix this,
 and then "git tag -l" is made to run pager by default.

 If this works out OK, I think there are low-hanging fruits in
 other commands like "git branch" that outputs long list in one mode
 while taking input in another.


* rg/rerere-train-overwrite (2017-07-26) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-01 at 7fcd42974c)
 + contrib/rerere-train: optionally overwrite existing resolutions

 The "rerere-train" script (in contrib/) learned the "--overwrite"
 option to allow overwriting existing recorded resolutions.


* rs/bswap-ubsan-fix (2017-07-17) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-20 at ce6bad07b0)
 + bswap: convert get_be16, get_be32 and put_be32 to inline functions
 + bswap: convert to unsigned before shifting in get_be32

 Code clean-up.


* rs/move-array (2017-07-17) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-20 at f3086cd20e)
 + ls-files: don't try to prune an empty index
 + apply: use COPY_ARRAY and MOVE_ARRAY in update_image()
 + use MOVE_ARRAY
 + add MOVE_ARRAY

 Code clean-up.


* rs/pack-objects-pbase-cleanup (2017-07-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-20 at a6b618559b)
 + pack-objects: remove unnecessary NULL check

 Code clean-up.


* rs/stat-data-unaligned-reads-fix (2017-07-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-20 at e7d3782823)
 + dir: support platforms that require aligned reads

 Code clean-up.


* sb/hashmap-cleanup (2017-07-05) 10 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-12 at ce31d06165)
 + t/helper/test-hashmap: use custom data instead of duplicate cmp functions
 + name-hash.c: drop hashmap_cmp_fn cast
 + submodule-config.c: drop hashmap_cmp_fn cast
 + remote.c: drop hashmap_cmp_fn cast
 + patch-ids.c: drop hashmap_cmp_fn cast
 + convert/sub-process: drop cast to hashmap_cmp_fn
 + config.c: drop hashmap_cmp_fn cast
 + builtin/describe: drop hashmap_cmp_fn cast
 + builtin/difftool.c: drop hashmap_cmp_fn cast
 + attr.c: drop hashmap_cmp_fn cast

 Many uses of comparision callback function the hashmap API uses
 cast the callback function type when registering it to
 hashmap_init(), which defeats the compile time type checking when
 the callback interface changes (e.g. gaining more parameters).
 The callback implementations have been updated to take "void *"
 pointers and cast them to the type they expect instead.


* sb/object-id (2017-07-13) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-18 at e4df0ba3b1)
 + tag: convert gpg_verify_tag to use struct object_id
 + commit: convert lookup_commit_graft to struct object_id
 (this branch is used by bc/object-id and bw/submodule-config-cleanup.)

 Conversion from uchar[20] to struct object_id continues.


* st/lib-gpg-kill-stray-agent (2017-07-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-20 at 8ea68c483f)
 + t: lib-gpg: flush gpg agent on startup

 Some versions of GnuPG fails to kill gpg-agent it auto-spawned
 and such a left-over agent can interfere with a test.  Work it
 around by attempting to kill one before starting a new test.


* wd/rebase-conflict-guide (2017-07-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-20 at c78e758b23)
 + rebase: make resolve message clearer for inexperienced users

 The advice message given when "git rebase" stops for conflicting
 changes has been improved.

 - diff-delta: fix encoding size that would not fit in "unsigned int"

 The machinery to create xdelta used in pack files received the
 sizes of the data in size_t, but lost the higher bits of them by
 storing them in "unsigned int" during the computation, which is
 fixed.

 Will merge to 'next'.

* tc/curl-with-backports (2017-08-11) 2 commits
 - http: use a feature check to enable GSSAPI delegation control
 - http: fix handling of missing CURLPROTO_*

 Updates to the HTTP layer we made recently unconditionally used
 features of libCurl without checking the existence of them, causing
 compilation errors, which has been fixed.  Also migrate the code to
 check feature macros, not version numbers, to cope better with
 libCurl that vendor ships with backported features.

 - interpret-trailers: add an option to show only the trailers
 - trailer: put process_trailers() options into a struct

 "git interpret-trailers" has been taught a "--parse" and a few
 other options to make it easier for scripts to grab existing
 trailer lines from a commit log message.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2017-08-10) 1 commit
 - zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

 Needs review.

 There were some concerns raised around s/off_t/size_t/ in this
 change.


* pw/am-signoff (2017-08-08) 1 commit
 - am: fix signoff when other trailers are present

 "git am -s" has been taught that some input may end with a trailer
 block that is not Signed-off-by: and it should refrain from adding
 an extra blank line before adding a new sign-off in such a case.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* rj/add-chmod-error-message (2017-08-09) 1 commit

* ur/svn-local-zone (2017-08-08) 1 commit
 - git svn fetch: Create correct commit timestamp when using --localtime

 "git svn" used with "--localtime" option did not compute the tz
 offset for the timestamp in question and instead always used the
 current time, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jt/sha1-file-cleanup (2017-08-11) 2 commits
 - sha1_file: remove read_packed_sha1()
 - sha1_file: set whence in storage-specific info fn

 Preparatory code clean-up.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* kw/rebase-progress (2017-08-14) 2 commits
 - rebase: turn on progress option by default for format-patch
 - format-patch: have progress option while generating patches

 "git rebase", especially when it is run by mistake and ends up
 trying to replay many changes, spent long time in silence.  The
 command has been taught to show progress report when it spends
 long time preparing these many changes to replay (which would give
 the user a chance to abort with ^C).

 Will merge to 'next'.


* mk/diff-delta-avoid-large-offset (2017-08-11) 1 commit
 - diff-delta: do not allow delta offset truncation

 The delta format used in the packfile cannot reference data at
 offset larger than what can be expressed in 4-byte, but the
 generator for the data failed to make sure the offset does not
 overflow.  This has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* nm/stash-untracked (2017-08-11) 1 commit
 - stash: clean untracked files before reset

 "git stash -u" used the contents of the committed version of the
 ".gitignore" file to decide which paths are ignored, even when the
 file has local changes.  The command has been taught to instead use
 the locally modified contents.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* rs/object-id (2017-08-14) 1 commit
 - tree-walk: convert fill_tree_descriptor() to object_id

 Conversion from uchar[20] to struct object_id continues.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ah/doc-empty-string-is-false (2017-08-14) 1 commit
 - doc: clarify "config --bool" behaviour with empty string

 Doc update.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jt/diff-color-move-fix (2017-08-14) 3 commits
 - diff: check MIN_BLOCK_LENGTH at start of new block
 - diff: respect MIN_BLOCK_LENGTH for last block
 - diff: avoid redundantly clearing a flag
 (this branch uses sb/diff-color-move.)

 A handful of bugfixes to "diff --color-moved".


* kd/stash-with-bash-4.4 (2017-08-14) 1 commit
 - stash: prevent warning about null bytes in input

 bash 4.4 or newer gave a warning on NUL byte in command
 substitution done in "git stash"; this has been squelched.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* kw/commit-keep-index-when-pre-commit-is-not-run (2017-08-14) 1 commit
 - commit: skip discarding the index if there is no pre-commit hook

 "git commit" used to discard the index and re-read from the filesystem
 just in case the pre-commit hook has updated it in the middle; this
 has been optimized out when we know we do not run the pre-commit hook.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* bw/git-clang-format (2017-08-14) 2 commits
 - Makefile: add style build rule
 - clang-format: outline the git project's coding style

 "make style" runs git-clang-format to help developers by pointing
 out coding style issues.

* mg/status-in-progress-info (2017-05-10) 2 commits
 - status --short --inprogress: spell it as --in-progress
 - status: show in-progress info for short status

 "git status" learns an option to report various operations
 (e.g. "merging") that the user is in the middle of.

 - worktree.c: add update_worktree_location()
 - worktree.c: add validate_worktree()

 "git worktree" learned move and remove subcommands.

 - Documentation/clone: document ignored configuration variables
 - clone: respect additional configured fetch refspecs during initial fetch
 (this branch is used by sg/remote-no-string-refspecs.)

 "git clone -c var=val" is a way to set configuration variables in
 the resulting repository, but it is more useful to also make these
 variables take effect while the initial clone is happening,
 e.g. these configuration variables could be fetch refspecs.

 Waiting for a response.

* pw/sequence-rerere-autoupdate (2017-08-02) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-14 at 010cbb0cbe)
 + cherry-pick/revert: reject --rerere-autoupdate when continuing
 + cherry-pick/revert: remember --rerere-autoupdate
 + t3504: use test_commit
 + rebase -i: honor --rerere-autoupdate
 + rebase: honor --rerere-autoupdate
 + am: remember --rerere-autoupdate setting

 Commands like "git rebase" accepted the --rerere-autoupdate option
 from the command line, but did not always use it.  This has been
 fixed.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* bw/clone-recursive-quiet (2017-08-04) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-14 at fbd4473ce4)
 + clone: teach recursive clones to respect -q

 "git clone --recurse-submodules --quiet" did not pass the quiet
 option down to submodules.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* lg/merge-signoff (2017-07-25) 1 commit
 - merge: add a --signoff flag

 "git merge" learned a "--signoff" option to add the Signed-off-by:
 trailer with the committer's name.


* pb/trailers-from-command-line (2017-08-14) 4 commits
 - interpret-trailers: fix documentation typo
 - interpret-trailers: add options for actions
 - trailers: introduce struct new_trailer_item
 - trailers: export action enums and corresponding lookup functions

 "git interpret-trailers" learned to take the trailer specifications
 from the command line that overrides the configured values.


* sb/submodule-recursive-checkout-detach-head (2017-07-28) 2 commits
 - Documentation/checkout: clarify submodule HEADs to be detached
 - recursive submodules: detach HEAD from new state

 "git checkout --recursive" may overwrite and rewind the history of
 the branch that happens to be checked out in submodule
 repositories, which might not be desirable.  Detach the HEAD but
 still allow the recursive checkout to succeed in such a case.

 Undecided.
 This needs justification in a larger picture; it is unclear why
 this is better than rejecting recursive checkout, for example.


* ti/external-sha1dc (2017-07-25) 1 commit
 - hash: allow building with the external sha1dc library

 Platforms that ship with a separate sha1 with collision detection
 library can link to it instead of using the copy we ship as part of
 our source tree.

 - submodule: remove submodule_config callback routine
 - unpack-trees: don't respect submodule.update
 - submodule: don't rely on overlayed config when setting diffopts
 - fetch: don't overlay config with submodule-config

 - Merge branch 'bc/object-id' into bw/submodule-config-cleanup
 - Merge branch 'bw/grep-recurse-submodules' into bw/submodule-config-cleanup
 (this branch uses bw/grep-recurse-submodules.)

 Code clean-up to avoid mixing values read from the .gitmodules file
 and values read from the .git/config file.

  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-14 at 421dc09fd0)
 + submodule--helper: teach push-check to handle HEAD

 "git push --recurse-submodules $there HEAD:$target" was not
 propagated down to the submodules, but now it is.

 (this branch is used by bw/submodule-config-cleanup.)

 "git grep --recurse-submodules" has been reworked to give a more
 consistent output across submodule boundary (and do its thing
 without having to fork a separate process).

 Will merge to 'master'.


* rs/sha1-file-micro-optim (2017-07-09) 2 commits

* jc/allow-lazy-cas (2017-07-06) 1 commit
 - push: disable lazy --force-with-lease by default

 Because "git push --force-with-lease[=<ref>]" that relies on the
 stability of remote-tracking branches is unsafe when something
 fetches into the repository behind user's back, it is now disabled
 by default.  A new configuration variable can be used to enable it
 by users who know what they are doing.  This would pave the way to
 possibly turn `--force` into `--force-with-lease`.

 Undecided.
 Independent from disabling the feature by default, this stirred up
 a discussion to replace the DWIM heuristics with a better one, which
 deserves to be its own topic.

  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-14 at 24db08a6e8)
 + pathspec: die on empty strings as pathspec
 + t0027: do not use an empty string as a pathspec element

 The final step to make an empty string as a pathspec element
 illegal.  We started this by first deprecating and warning a
 pathspec that has such an element in 2.11 (Nov 2016).

 Hopefully we can merge this down to the 'master' by the end of the
 year?  A deprecation warning period that is about 1 year does not
 sound too bad.

 Will cook in 'next'.

* sd/branch-copy (2017-06-18) 3 commits
 - branch: add a --copy (-c) option to go with --move (-m)
 - branch: add test for -m renaming multiple config sections
 - config: create a function to format section headers

 "git branch" learned "-c/-C" to create and switch to a new branch
 by copying an existing one.

 I personally do not think "branch --copy master backup" while on
 "master" that switches to "backup" is a good UI, and I *will* say
 "I told you so" when users complain after we merge this down to
 'master'.


* sb/diff-color-move (2017-06-30) 26 commits
 - diff: document the new --color-moved setting
 - diff.c: add dimming to moved line detection

 "git diff" has been taught to optionally paint new lines that are
 the same as deleted lines elsewhere differently from genuinely new
 lines.

 "git gc" and friends when multiple worktrees are used off of a

 of other worktrees as the root for reachability traversal, making
 objects that are in use only in other worktrees to be subject to
 garbage collection.
