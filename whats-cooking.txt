What's cooking in git.git (Feb 2018, #02; Tue, 13)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

* gs/retire-mru (2018-01-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-07 at 4b2e893911)
 + mru: Replace mru.[ch] with list.h implementation
 (this branch uses ot/mru-on-list.)

 Retire mru API as it does not give enough abstraction over
 underlying list API to be worth it.


* jc/mailinfo-cleanup-fix (2018-01-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-07 at 65d41f993b)

* jh/fsck-promisors (2017-12-08) 10 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-01-23 at ca59f5c18e)
 + gc: do not repack promisor packfiles
 + rev-list: support termination at promisor objects
 + sha1_file: support lazily fetching missing objects
 + introduce fetch-object: fetch one promisor object
 + index-pack: refactor writing of .keep files
 + fsck: support promisor objects as CLI argument
 + fsck: support referenced promisor objects
 + fsck: support refs pointing to promisor objects
 + fsck: introduce partialclone extension
 + extension.partialclone: introduce partial clone extension
 (this branch is used by jh/partial-clone.)

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2018-01-17

 In preparation for implementing narrow/partial clone, the machinery
 for checking object connectivity used by gc and fsck has been
 taught that a missing object is OK when it is referenced by a
 packfile specially marked as coming from trusted repository that
 promises to make them available on-demand and lazily.


* jh/partial-clone (2017-12-08) 13 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-01-23 at de0f0111ea)
 + t5616: test bulk prefetch after partial fetch
 + fetch: inherit filter-spec from partial clone
 + t5616: end-to-end tests for partial clone
 + fetch-pack: restore save_commit_buffer after use
 + unpack-trees: batch fetching of missing blobs
 + clone: partial clone
 + partial-clone: define partial clone settings in config
 + fetch: support filters
 + fetch: refactor calculation of remote list
 + fetch-pack: test support excluding large blobs
 + fetch-pack: add --no-filter
 + fetch-pack, index-pack, transport: partial clone
 + upload-pack: add object filtering for partial clone
 (this branch uses jh/fsck-promisors.)

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2018-01-17

 The machinery to clone & fetch, which in turn involves packing and
 unpacking objects, have been told how to omit certain objects using
 the filtering mechanism introduced by the jh/object-filtering
 topic, and also mark the resulting pack as a promisor pack to
 tolerate missing objects, taking advantage of the mechanism
 introduced by the jh/fsck-promisors topic.


* jk/daemon-fixes (2018-01-25) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-07 at 0e4fe8f8cc)

 Crash fix for a corner case where an error codepath tried to unlock
 what it did not acquire lock on.


* nd/diff-flush-before-warning (2018-01-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-07 at 9c67f58ae0)

  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-07 at a75d04a675)
 + completion: fix completing merge strategies on non-C locales

 Completion of "git merge -s<strategy>" (in contrib/) did not work
 well in non-C locale.


* nd/shared-index-fix (2018-01-24) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-07 at c5d6e68c91)

 + read-cache.c: move tempfile creation/cleanup out of write_shared_index
 + read-cache.c: change type of "temp" in write_shared_index()

 Code clean-up.


* nd/trace-with-env (2018-01-19) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-07 at 68399411d9)
 + run-command.c: print new cwd in trace_run_command()

  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-07 at ee1ee4ac79)
 + mru: use double-linked list from list.h
 (this branch is used by gs/retire-mru.)

 The first step to getting rid of mru API and using the
 doubly-linked list API directly instead.


* pc/submodule-helper (2018-01-16) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-07 at 53b4524eca)
 + submodule: port submodule subcommand 'deinit' from shell to C
 + submodule: port submodule subcommand 'sync' from shell to C

 Rewrite two more "git submodule" subcommands in C.


* po/clang-format-functype-weight (2018-01-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-07 at 0724aaae38)
 + clang-format: adjust penalty for return type line break

 Prevent "clang-format" from breaking line after function return type.


* po/http-push-error-message (2018-01-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-07 at 3dccd32857)
 + http-push: improve error log

 Debugging aid.


* pw/sequencer-in-process-commit (2018-01-24) 14 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-07 at ab5961edd9)
 + sequencer: run 'prepare-commit-msg' hook
 + t7505: add tests for cherry-pick and rebase -i/-p
 + t7505: style fixes
 + sequencer: assign only free()able strings to gpg_sign
 + sequencer: improve config handling
 + t3512/t3513: remove KNOWN_FAILURE_CHERRY_PICK_SEES_EMPTY_COMMIT=1
 + sequencer: try to commit without forking 'git commit'
 + sequencer: load commit related config
 + sequencer: simplify adding Signed-off-by: trailer
 + commit: move print_commit_summary() to libgit
 + commit: move post-rewrite code to libgit
 + Add a function to update HEAD after creating a commit
 + commit: move empty message checks to libgit
 + t3404: check intermediate squash messages

 The sequencer infrastructure is shared across "git cherry-pick",
 "git rebase -i", etc., and has always spawned "git commit" when it
 needs to create a commit.  It has been taught to do so internally,
 when able, by reusing the codepath "git commit" itself uses, which
 gives performance boost for a few tens of percents in some sample
 scenarios.


* rb/hashmap-h-compilation-fix (2018-01-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-07 at 780bc6d06b)

 Update Coccinelle rules to catch and optimize strbuf_addf(&buf, "%s", str)


* sg/cocci-move-array (2018-01-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-07 at 6ced765979)
 + Use MOVE_ARRAY

 Code clean-up.


* sg/travis-linux32-sanity (2018-01-30) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-07 at 0349cf505c)

 + travis-ci: don't run the test suite as root in the 32 bit Linux build
 + travis-ci: don't repeat the path of the cache directory
 + travis-ci: use 'set -e' in the 32 bit Linux build job
 + travis-ci: use 'set -x' for the commands under 'su' in the 32 bit Linux build

 Travis updates.


* tb/crlf-conv-flags (2018-01-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-07 at 1981be1b46)
 + convert_to_git(): safe_crlf/checksafe becomes int conv_flags
 (this branch is used by ls/checkout-encoding.)

 Code clean-up.


* tg/split-index-fixes (2018-01-19) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-07 at 52d7a92ec5)
 + travis: run tests with GIT_TEST_SPLIT_INDEX
 + split-index: don't write cache tree with null oid entries
 + read-cache: fix reading the shared index for other repos

 The split-index mode had a few corner case bugs fixed.


* tz/doc-show-defaults-to-head (2018-01-30) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-02-07 at fa21fb2ec8)
 + doc: mention 'git show' defaults to HEAD

 Doc update.

[New Topics]

* bp/name-hash-dirname-fix (2018-02-08) 1 commit
 - name-hash: properly fold directory names in adjust_dirname_case()

 "git add" files in the same directory, but spelling the directory
 path in different cases on case insensitive filesystem, corrupted

* ma/config-page-only-in-list-mode (2018-02-12) 3 commits
 - config: change default of `pager.config` to "on"
 - config: respect `pager.config` in list/get-mode only
 - t7006: add tests for how git config paginates

 In a way similar to how "git tag" learned to honor the pager
 setting only in the list mode, "git config" learned to ignore the
 pager setting when it is used for setting values (i.e. when the
 purpose of the operation is not to "show").

 Waiting for discussion to conclude.

* dj/runtime-prefix (2017-12-05) 4 commits
 . exec_cmd: RUNTIME_PREFIX on some POSIX systems
 . Makefile: add Perl runtime prefix support
 . Makefile: add support for "perllibdir"
 . Makefile: generate Perl header from template file

 A build-time option has been added to allow Git to be told to refer
 to its associated files relative to the main binary, in the same
 way that has been possible on Windows for quite some time, for
 Linux, BSDs and Darwin.

 Tentatively kicked out of 'next' to see how well another topic
 ab/simplify-perl-makefile that heavily conflicts with this fares.


* mk/http-backend-content-length (2017-11-27) 4 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - t5560-http-backend-noserver.sh: add CONTENT_LENGTH cases
 - SQUASH???
 - http-backend: respect CONTENT_LENGTH as specified by rfc3875

 The http-backend (used for smart-http transport) used to slurp the
 whole input until EOF, without paying attention to CONTENT_LENGTH
 that is supplied in the environment and instead expecting the Web
 server to close the input stream.  This has been fixed.

 Expecting a reroll.
 Suggested fixes to be used when rerolling is queued, but I'd
 prefer _not_ squashing them myself.

 Also, it may be too complex solution for the problem.

* cc/require-tcl-tk-for-build (2017-11-29) 2 commits
 - travis-ci: avoid new tcl/tk build requirement
 - Makefile: check that tcl/tk is installed

 A first-time builder of Git may have installed neither tclsh nor
 msgfmt, in which case git-gui and gitk part will fail and break the
 build.  As a workaround, refuse to run a build when tclsh is not
 installed and NO_TCLTK is not set.

 Undecided.
 I still feel that requring tclsh to be installed, with or without
 "escape hatch" for experts, may be too heavy-handed.


* mg/merge-base-fork-point (2017-09-17) 3 commits
 - merge-base: find fork-point outside partial reflog
 - merge-base: return fork-point outside reflog
 - t6010: test actual test output

 "merge-base --fork-point $branch $commit" is used to guess on which
 commit among the commits that were once at the tip of the $branch the
 $commit was built on top of, and it learns these historical tips from
 the reflog of the $branch.  When the true fork-point is lost due to
 pruning of old reflog entries, the command does not give any output,
 because it has no way to guess correctly and does not want to mislead
 the user with a wrong guess.

 The command has been updated to give the best but not known to be
 correct guess, based on a hope that a merge-base between $commit and a
 virtual merge across all the reflog entries that still are available
 for $branch may still be a closer to the true fork-point than the
 merge-base between $commit and the current tip of the $branch.

 This may have to be offered by an additional option, to allow the
 users that are prepared to see a potentially incorrect guess to opt
 into the feature, without affecting the current callers that may not
 be prepared to accept a guess that is not known to be correct.

 What's the doneness of this one?


* jk/drop-ancient-curl (2017-08-09) 5 commits
 - http: #error on too-old curl
 - curl: remove ifdef'd code never used with curl >=7.19.4
 - http: drop support for curl < 7.19.4
 - http: drop support for curl < 7.16.0
 - http: drop support for curl < 7.11.1

 Some code in http.c that has bitrot is being removed.

 Expecting a reroll.


* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2017-08-10) 1 commit
 . zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

 Needs resurrecting by making sure the fix is good and still applies
 (or adjusted to today's codebase).


* mg/status-in-progress-info (2017-05-10) 2 commits
 - status --short --inprogress: spell it as --in-progress
 - status: show in-progress info for short status

 "git status" learns an option to report various operations
 (e.g. "merging") that the user is in the middle of.

* bp/untracked-cache-noflush (2018-02-05) 1 commit
 - dir.c: don't flag the index as dirty for changes to the untracked cache

 Writing out the index file when the only thing that changed in it
 is the untracked cache information is often wasteful, and this has
 been optimized out.

 Waiting for the discussion to finish.

 I do not mind refraining from using these keywords in a foreign
 language in our codebase too much, but at the same time, renaming
 must be done a bit more thoughtfully.  When the original uses 'new'
 together with and in contrast to 'old', renaming 'new' must be done
 while preserving the pairing (which may involve renaming 'old' as
 well), for example.

 Rename detection logic in "diff" family that is used in "merge" has
 learned to guess when all of x/a, x/b and x/c have moved to z/a,
 z/b and z/c, it is likely that x/d added in the meantime would also
 want to move to z/d by taking the hint that the entire directory
 'x' moved to 'z'.
