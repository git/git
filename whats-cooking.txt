Subject: What's cooking in git.git (Nov 2019, #02; Fri, 8)

What's cooking in git.git (Nov 2019, #02; Fri, 8)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

Git 2.24 has been tagged.  Hopefully there needs no immediate brown
paper bag fixes needed for the 'master' branch. The next cycle will
start perhaps early next week by first rewinding the 'next' branch,
after the dust settles. Topics marked as "will cook in next" can be
given a fresh start by ejecting them from 'next' and queueing a new
version (please just ask). Topics currently not in 'next' will then
start getting merged down after all that.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* am/pathspec-from-file (2019-11-07) 6 commits
 - commit: support the --pathspec-from-file option
 - doc: commit: unify <pathspec> description
 - reset: support the `--pathspec-from-file` option
 - doc: reset: unify <pathspec> description
 - pathspec: add new function to parse file
 - parse-options.h: add new options `--pathspec-from-file`, `--pathspec-file-nul`

 A few commands learned to take the pathspec from the
 standard input or a named file, instead of taking it as the command
 line arguments.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* cb/curl-use-xmalloc (2019-11-07) 1 commit
 - remote-curl: unbreak http.extraHeader with custom allocators

 HTTP transport had possible allocator/deallocator mismatch, which
 has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ds/commit-graph-delay-gen-progress (2019-11-07) 1 commit
 - commit-graph: use start_delayed_progress()

 One kind of progress messages were always given during commit-graph
 generation, instead of following the "if it takes more than two
 seconds, show progress" pattern, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ec/fetch-mark-common-refs-trace2 (2019-11-07) 1 commit
 - fetch: add trace2 instrumentation

 Trace2 annotation.

 Expecting a response to review.


* en/misc-doc-fixes (2019-11-07) 3 commits
 - name-hash.c: remove duplicate word in comment
 - hashmap: fix documentation misuses of -> versus .
 - git-filter-branch.txt: correct argument name typo

 Misc doc fixes.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* en/t6024-style (2019-11-07) 1 commit
 - t6024: modernize style

 Test updates.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ep/guard-kset-tar-headers (2019-11-07) 1 commit
 - kset.h, tar.h: add missing header guard to prevent multiple inclusion

 Code clean-up.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* js/fetch-multi-lockfix (2019-11-06) 2 commits
 - fetch: avoid locking issues between fetch.jobs/fetch.writeCommitGraph
 - fetch: add the command-line option `--write-commit-graph`

 Fetching from multiple remotes into the same repository in parallel
 had a bad interaction with the recent change to (optionally) update
 the commit-graph after a fetch job finishes, as these parallel
 fetches compete with each other.  Which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jt/fetch-remove-lazy-fetch-plugging (2019-11-06) 1 commit
 - fetch: remove fetch_if_missing=0

 "git fetch" codepath had a big "do not lazily fetch missing objects
 when I ask if something exists" switch.  This has been corrected by
 marking the "does this thing exist?" calls with "if not please do not
 lazily fetch it" flag.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* kw/fsmonitor-watchman-fix (2019-11-06) 1 commit
 - fsmonitor: fix watchman integration

 The watchman integration for fsmonitor was racy, which has been
 corrected to be more conservative.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ln/userdiff-elixir (2019-11-08) 1 commit
 - userdiff: add Elixir to supported languages

 The patterns to detect function boundary for Elixir language has
 been added.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ns/test-desc-typofix (2019-11-07) 1 commit
 - t: fix typo in test descriptions

 Typofix.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* py/shortlog-list-options-for-log (2019-11-06) 1 commit
 - git-shortlog.txt: include commit limiting options

 Documentation pages for "git shortlog" now lists commit limiting
 options explicitly.

 Expecting a reroll.  
 It excludes too much (e.g. the section for pathspec based history
 simplification) in a way that makes future shuffling of sections
 in rev-list-options.txt error prone.


* rs/trace2-dots (2019-11-06) 1 commit
 - trace2: add dots directly to strbuf in perf_fmt_prepare()

 Code cleanup.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* dd/sequencer-utf8 (2019-11-07) 8 commits

 - sequencer: reencode old merge-commit message
 - sequencer: reencode squashing commit's message
 - sequencer: reencode revert/cherry-pick's todo list
 - sequencer: reencode to utf-8 before arrange rebase's todo list
 - t3900: demonstrate git-rebase problem with multi encoding
 - configure.ac: define ICONV_OMITS_BOM if necessary
 - t0028: eliminate non-standard usage of printf

 Handling of commit objects that use non UTF-8 encoding during
 "rebase -i" has been improved.

 - t5520: replace test -{n,z} with test-lib functions
 - t5520: use test_line_count where possible
 - t5520: remove spaces after redirect operator
 - t5520: replace test -f with test-lib functions
 - t5520: let sed open its own input
 - t5520: use sq for test case names

 Test cleanup.

 Expecting a response to review.

* vn/reset-deleted-ita (2019-07-26) 1 commit
 - reset: unstage empty deleted ita files

 "git reset HEAD [<pathspec>]" did not reset an empty file that was
 added with the intent-to-add bit.

 Expecting a reroll.


* jn/unknown-index-extensions (2018-11-21) 2 commits
 - index: offer advice for unknown index extensions
 - index: do not warn about unrecognized extensions

 A bit too alarming warning given when unknown index extensions
 exist is getting revamped.

 Expecting a reroll.


* jc/format-patch-delay-message-id (2019-04-05) 1 commit
 - format-patch: move message-id and related headers to the end

 The location "git format-patch --thread" adds the Message-Id:
 header in the series of header fields has been moved down, which
 may help working around a suspected bug in GMail MSA, reported at
 <CAHk-=whP1stFZNAaJiMi5eZ9rj0MRt20Y_yHVczZPH+O01d+sA@mail.gmail.com>

 Waiting for feedback to see if it truly helps.
 Needs tests.


* js/protocol-advertise-multi (2018-12-28) 1 commit
 - protocol: advertise multiple supported versions

 The transport layer has been updated so that the protocol version
 used can be negotiated between the parties, by the initiator
 listing the protocol versions it is willing to talk, and the other
 side choosing from one of them.

 Expecting a reroll.
 cf. <CANq=j3u-zdb_FvNJGPCmygNMScseav63GhVvBX3NcVS4f7TejA@mail.gmail.com>


* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2018-10-15) 1 commit
 - zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

 "git stash save" in a working tree that is sparsely checked out
 mistakenly removed paths that are outside the area of interest.

  (merged to 'next' on 2019-10-30 at 06f719efa5)
 + pretty: add "%aL" etc. to show local-part of email addresses
 + t4203: use test-lib.sh definitions
 + t6006: use test-lib.sh definitions

 The custom format for "git log --format=<format>" learned the l/L
 placeholder that is similar to e/E that fills in the e-mail
 address, but only the local part on the left side of '@'.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* sg/commit-graph-usage-fix (2019-10-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-10-28 at 13d01506dd)

 Messages from die() etc. can be mixed up from multiple processes
 without even line buffering on Windows, which has been worked
 around.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ma/bisect-doc-sample-update (2019-10-29) 1 commit
 - Documentation/git-bisect.txt: add --no-ff to merge command

 "git merge --no-commit" needs "--no-ff" if you do not want to move
 HEAD, which has been corrected in the manual page for "git bisect".

 Will merge to 'next'.


* mr/clone-dir-exists-to-path-exists (2019-10-29) 1 commit

* pb/no-recursive-reset-hard-in-worktree-add (2019-10-30) 1 commit
 - worktree: teach "add" to ignore submodule.recurse config

 "git worktree add" internally calls "reset --hard" that should not
 descend into submodules, even when submodule.recurse configuration
 is set, but it was affected.  This has been correct.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 Crufty code and logic accumulated over time around the object
 parsing and low-level object access used in "git fsck" have been
 cleaned up.

 Will cook in 'next'.

 - Doc: Bundle file usage

 Doc update.

 Expecting a reroll.

 + commit: give correct advice for empty commit during a rebase
 + sequencer: export the function to get the path of `.git/rebase-merge/`
 + cherry-pick: add test for `--skip` advice in `git commit`

 The logic used in "git commit" to give hints and errors depending
 on what operation was in progress learned to distinguish rebase and
 cherry-pick better.

 Perhaps discard and expect a reroll.
 cf. <9d550cd9-08a2-eee5-7d7f-63678285accc@gmail.com>

 + notes: fix minimum number of parameters to "copy" subcommand
 + t3301: test diagnose messages for too few/many paramters

 "git notes copy $original" ought to copy the notes attached to the

 parameter validation made earlier disabled that feature by mistake.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 - git_path(): handle `.lock` files correctly
 - t1400: wrap setup code in test case

 + move run_commit_hook() to libgit and use it there
 + sequencer.h fix placement of #endif
 + t3404: remove uneeded calls to set_fake_editor
 + t3404: set $EDITOR in subshell
 + t3404: remove unnecessary subshell

 "rebase -i" ceased to run post-commit hook by mistake in an earlier
 update, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.

* dl/format-patch-cover-from-desc (2019-10-16) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-10-18 at 40e992b6f5)
 + format-patch: teach --cover-from-description option
 + format-patch: use enum variables
 + format-patch: replace erroneous and condition

 The branch description ("git branch --edit-description") has been

 + merge-recursive: fix merging a subdirectory into the root directory
 + merge-recursive: clean up get_renamed_dir_portion()

 When all files from some subdirectory were renamed to the root

 been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 - submodule-config: add skip_if_read option to repo_read_gitmodules()
 - grep: replace grep_read_mutex by internal obj read lock
 - object-store: allow threaded access to object reading
 - replace-object: make replace operations thread-safe
 - grep: fix racy calls in grep_objects()
 - grep: fix race conditions at grep_submodule()
 - grep: fix race conditions on userdiff calls

 Traditionally, we avoided threaded grep while searching in objects
 (as opposed to files in the working tree) as accesses to the object
 layer is not thread-safe.  This limitation is getting lifted.

 What's the current status of this one?


* jk/packfile-reuse-cleanup (2019-10-23) 9 commits
 - pack-objects: improve partial packfile reuse
 - builtin/pack-objects: introduce obj_is_packed()
 - pack-objects: introduce pack.allowPackReuse
 - csum-file: introduce hashfile_total()
 - pack-bitmap: introduce bitmap_walk_contains()
 - pack-bitmap: don't rely on bitmap_git->reuse_objects
 - ewah/bitmap: introduce bitmap_word_alloc()
 + packfile: expose get_delta_base()
 + builtin/pack-objects: report reused packfile objects

 The way "git pack-objects" reuses objects stored in existing pack
 to generate its result has been improved.

 Will merge to 'next'.
