What's cooking in git.git (Feb 2021, #02; Wed, 10)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'seen' (formerly 'pu'---proposed updates) while commits prefixed
with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

The seventh batch of topics are in 'master'.  On the 'maint' front,
bunch of fixes that have already been in 'master' were merged there
and the result has been tagged as Git 2.30.1.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

Release tarballs are available at:

 Lose the debugging aid that may have been useful in the past, but
 no longer is, in the "grep" codepaths.

* jk/p5303-sed-portability-fix (2021-01-29) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-01-31 at 5f2957e738)
 + p5303: avoid sed GNU-ism

 A perf script was made more portable.


* jk/pretty-lazy-load-commit (2021-01-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-01 at acf7353a32)
 + pretty: lazy-load commit data when expanding user-format

 Some pretty-format specifiers do not need the data in commit object
 (e.g. "%H"), but we were over-eager to load and parse it, which has
 been made even lazier.


* jk/t0000-cleanups (2021-01-28) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-01-31 at 357f8fe097)
 + t0000: consistently use single quotes for outer tests
 + t0000: run cleaning test inside sub-test
 + t0000: run prereq tests inside sub-test
 + t0000: keep clean-up tests together

 Code clean-up.


* jk/use-oid-pos (2021-01-28) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-01-31 at 10ccafb739)
 + oid_pos(): access table through const pointers
 + hash_pos(): convert to oid_pos()
 + rerere: use strmap to store rerere directories
 + rerere: tighten rr-cache dirname check
 + rerere: check dirname format while iterating rr_cache directory
 + commit_graft_pos(): take an oid instead of a bare hash

 Code clean-up to ensure our use of hashtables using object names as
 keys use the "struct object_id" objects, not the raw hash values.


* jk/weather-balloon-require-variadic-macro (2021-01-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-01-31 at 8d5207bd85)
 + git-compat-util: always enable variadic macros

 We've carried compatibility codepaths for compilers without
 variadic macros for quite some time, but the world may be ready for
 them to be removed.  Force compilation failure on exotic platforms
 where variadic macros are not available to find out who screams in
 such a way that we can easily revert if it turns out that the world
 is not yet ready.


* js/rebase-i-commit-cleanup-fix (2021-01-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-01-31 at 358f562e1f)
 + rebase -i: do leave commit message intact in fixup! chains

 When "git rebase -i" processes "fixup" insn, there is no reason to
 clean up the commit log message, but we did the usual stripspace
 processing.  This has been corrected.


* jv/pack-objects-narrower-ref-iteration (2021-01-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-01-26 at 8a0d178c01)
 + builtin/pack-objects.c: avoid iterating all refs

 The "pack-objects" command needs to iterate over all the tags when
 automatic tag following is enabled, but it actually iterated over
 all refs and then discarded everything outside "refs/tags/"
 hierarchy, which was quite wasteful.


* pb/blame-funcname-range-userdiff (2021-01-30) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-01-31 at 107d10fe4f)
 + annotate-tests: quote variable expansions containing path names

 Test fix.


* pb/ci-matrix-wo-shortcut (2021-01-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-01-31 at 2384693758)
 + ci: do not cancel all jobs of a matrix if one fails

 Our setting of GitHub CI test jobs were a bit too eager to give up
 once there is even one failure found.  Tweak the knob to allow
 other jobs keep running even when we see a failure, so that we can
 find more failures in a single run.


* ph/use-delete-refs (2021-01-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-01-26 at e03486152e)
 + use delete_refs when deleting tags or branches

 When removing many branches and tags, the code used to do so one
 ref at a time.  There is another API it can use to delete multiple
 refs, and it makes quite a lot of performance difference when the
 refs are packed.


* rs/worktree-list-verbose (2021-01-30) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-01 at b57a6ce4c6)
 + worktree: teach `list` verbose mode
 + worktree: teach `list` to annotate prunable worktree
 + worktree: teach `list --porcelain` to annotate locked worktree
 + t2402: ensure locked worktree is properly cleaned up
 + worktree: teach worktree_lock_reason() to gently handle main worktree
 + worktree: teach worktree to lazy-load "prunable" reason
 + worktree: libify should_prune_worktree()

 `git worktree list` now annotates worktrees as prunable, shows
 locked and prunable attributes in --porcelain mode, and gained
 a --verbose option.

 Test fix.


* sg/test-stress-jobs (2021-01-26) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-01 at 0b7aae84e3)
 + test-lib: prevent '--stress-jobs=X' from being ignored

 Test framework fix.


* so/log-diff-merge (2020-12-21) 32 commits

* tb/ls-refs-optim (2021-01-22) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-01-26 at 09edbf7d9a)
 + ls-refs.c: traverse prefixes of disjoint "ref-prefix" sets
 + ls-refs.c: initialize 'prefixes' before using it
 + refs: expose 'for_each_fullref_in_prefixes'

 The ls-refs protocol operation has been optimized to narrow the
 sub-hierarchy of refs/ it walks to produce response.

  (merged to 'next' on 2021-01-26 at af7522d2cf)
 + ls-files.c: add --deduplicate option
 + ls_files.c: consolidate two for loops into one
 + ls_files.c: bugfix for --deleted and --modified

 "git ls-files" can and does show multiple entries when the index is
 unmerged, which is a source for confusion unless -s/-u option is in
 use.  A new option --deduplicate has been introduced.

[New Topics]

* js/range-diff-one-side-only (2021-02-06) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-08 at 8c35ed8523)

 + range-diff: avoid leaking memory in two error code paths

 The "git range-diff" command learned "--(left|right)-only" option
 to show only one side of the compared range.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 Doc update.

 Expecting a reroll.

 "git maintenance" tool learned a new "pack-refs" maintenance task.

 Will merge to 'next' after waiting for a few more days for comments.



* jk/mailmap-only-at-root (2021-02-10) 1 commit
 - mailmap: only look for .mailmap in work tree

 The .mailmap is documented to be read only from the root level of a
 working tree, but a stray file in a bare repository also was read
 by accident, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/rev-list-disk-usage (2021-02-09) 3 commits
 - fixup! rev-list: add --disk-usage option for calculating disk usage
 - rev-list: add --disk-usage option for calculating disk usage
 - t: add --no-tag option to test_commit

* jt/trace2-BUG (2021-02-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-09 at 94911ad676)
 + usage: trace2 BUG() invocations

 Even though invocations of "die()" were logged to the trace2
 system, "BUG()"s were not, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* mt/checkout-index-corner-cases (2021-02-09) 2 commits
 - checkout-index: omit entries with no tempname from --temp output
 - write_entry(): fix misuses of `path` in error messages

 The error codepath around the "--temp/--prefix" feature of "git
 checkout-index" has been improved.

 Expecting additional tests.


* mt/grep-cached-untracked (2021-02-09) 1 commit
 - grep: error out if --untracked is used with --cached

 "git grep --untracked" is meant to be "let's ALSO find in these
 files on the filesystem" when looking for matches in the working
 tree files, and does not make any sense if the primary search is
 done against the index, or the tree objects.  The "--cached" and
 "--untracked" options have been marked as mutually incompatible.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* tb/ci-run-cocci-with-18.04 (2021-02-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-09 at c50bc53527)
 + .github/workflows/main.yml: run static-analysis on bionic

 The version of Ubuntu Linux used by default at GitHub Actions CI
 has been updated to one that lack coccinelle; until it gets fixed,
 work it around by sticking to the previous release (18.04).

 Will merge to 'master'.

 Documentation, code and test clean-up around "git stash".

 Will merge to 'next' and to 'master' soonish.
 This is an early part of a topic that added a new feature to the 
 command, but the implementation is expected to need a handful of
 iterations; I split the preparatory part up to fast-track it.


* ew/rev-parse-since-test (2021-02-10) 1 commit
 - t1500: ensure current --since= behavior remains

 Test to make sure "git rev-parse one-thing one-thing" gives
 the same thing twice (when one-thing is --since=X).

 anybody who is motivated enough to report breakage.

 Will merge to 'next'.

[Stalled]

* jk/symlinked-dotgitx-files (2020-10-23) 9 commits
 - docs: document symlink restrictions for .git* files
 - fsck: complain when .gitattributes or .gitignore is a symlink
 - verify_path(): disallow symlinks in .gitattributes and .gitignore
 - t0060: test obscured .gitattributes and .gitignore matching
 - t7450: test .gitmodules symlink matching against obscured names
 - t7450: test verify_path() handling of gitmodules
 - t7415: rename to expand scope
 - fsck_tree(): wrap some long lines
 - fsck_tree(): fix shadowed variable

 "git fsck" and the corresponding check done during the transport
 learned to ensure that in-tree files like `.gitignore` and
 `.gitattributes` are not symbolic links.

 It seems that there are real projects with .gitignore recorded as
 symlinks, which may need to loosen the fsck setting.  Do we need to
 introduce a class that is separate from symlinked .gitmodules that
 has potential consequences that is more/less grave, so that these
 projects can opt out of the new checks?

 - simple-ipc: add win32 implementation
 - simple-ipc: design documentation for new IPC mechanism
 - pkt-line: accept additional options in read_packetized_to_strbuf()
 - pkt-line: (optionally) libify the packet readers
 - pkt-line: optionally skip the flush packet in write_packetized_from_buf()
 - pkt-line: add write_packetized_from_buf2() that takes scratch buffer

 A simple IPC interface gets introduced to build services like
 fsmonitor on top.


* ab/pager-exit-log (2021-02-01) 4 commits
 - pager: properly log pager exit code when signalled
 - run-command: add braces for "if" block in wait_or_whine()
 - pager: test for exit code with and without SIGPIPE
 - pager: refactor wait_for_pager() function

 When a pager spawned by us exited, the trace log did not record its
 exit status correctly, which has been corrected.


* jk/complete-branch-force-delete (2021-02-03) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-03 at 6454bb89b5)
 + doc/git-branch: fix awkward wording for "-c"
 + completion: handle other variants of "branch -m"
 + completion: treat "branch -D" the same way as "branch -d"

 The command line completion (in contrib/) completed "git branch -d"
 with branch names, but "git branch -D" offered tagnames in addition,
 which has been corrected.  "git branch -M" had the same problem.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ta/hash-function-transition-doc (2021-02-05) 6 commits
 - doc: use https links
 - doc hash-function-transition: move rationale upwards
 - doc hash-function-transition: fix incomplete sentence
 - doc hash-function-transition: use upper case consistently
 - doc hash-function-transition: use SHA-1 and SHA-256 consistently
 - doc hash-function-transition: fix asciidoc output

 Update formatting and grammar of the hash transition plan
 documentation, plus some updates.

 Will merge to 'next' after waiting for comments for a few days.

 - chunk-format: add technical docs
 - chunk-format: restore duplicate chunk checks
 - midx: use 64-bit multiplication for chunk sizes
 - midx: use chunk-format read API
 - commit-graph: use chunk-format read API
 - chunk-format: create read chunk API

 - chunk-format: create chunk format write API
 - commit-graph: anonymize data in chunk_write_fn
 (this branch uses ak/corrected-commit-date; is tangled with ds/commit-graph-genno-fix and ds/merge-base-independent.)

 The common code to deal with "chunked file format" that is shared
 by the multi-pack-index and commit-graph files have been factored
 out, to help codepaths for both filetypes to become more rebust.

 Will merge to 'next' after waiting for a few days.


* ds/merge-base-independent (2021-02-01) 5 commits
 - commit-reach: stale commits may prune generation further
 - commit-reach: use heuristic in remove_redundant()
 - commit-reach: move compare_commits_by_gen
 - commit-reach: use one walk in remove_redundant()
 - commit-reach: reduce requirements for remove_redundant()
 (this branch uses ak/corrected-commit-date; is tangled with ds/chunked-file-api and ds/commit-graph-genno-fix.)

 The code to implement "git merge-base --independent" was poorly
 done and was kept from the very beginning of the feature.


* hv/trailer-formatting (2021-02-06) 3 commits
 - ref-filter: use pretty.c logic for trailers
 - pretty.c: capture invalid trailer argument
 - pretty.c: refactor trailer logic to `format_set_trailers_options()`

 The logic to handle "trailer" related placeholders in the
 "--format=" mechanisms in the "log" family and "for-each-ref"
 family is getting unified.

 Ready for 'next'?


* sh/mergetool-hideresolved (2021-02-09) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-09 at c3ed19b2ec)
 + mergetool: add per-tool support and overrides for the hideResolved flag
 + mergetool: break setup_tool out into separate initialization function
 + mergetool: add hideResolved configuration

 "git mergetool" feeds three versions (base, local and remote) of
 a conflicted path unmodified.  The command learned to optionally
 prepare these files with unconflicted parts already resolved.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* tb/precompose-prefix-too (2021-02-03) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-05 at 1dd43136b1)
 + MacOS: precompose_argv_prefix()

 When commands are started from a subdirectory, they may have to
 compare the path to the subdirectory (called prefix and found out
 from $(pwd)) with the tracked paths.  On macOS, $(pwd) and
 readdir() yield decomposed path, while the tracked paths are
 usually normalized to the precomposed form, causing mismatch.  This
 has been fixed by taking the same approach used to normalize the
 command line arguments.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* cm/rebase-i (2021-01-29) 9 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-01 at 4f9aa6cec3)
 + doc/git-rebase: add documentation for fixup [-C|-c] options
 + rebase -i: teach --autosquash to work with amend!
 + t3437: test script for fixup [-C|-c] options in interactive rebase
 + rebase -i: add fixup [-C | -c] command
 + sequencer: use const variable for commit message comments
 + sequencer: pass todo_item to do_pick_commit()
 + rebase -i: comment out squash!/fixup! subjects from squash message
 + sequencer: factor out code to append squash message
 + rebase -i: only write fixup-message when it's needed
 (this branch is used by cm/rebase-i-updates.)

 "rebase -i" is getting cleaned up and also enhanced.

 Will cook in 'next' while waiting for the 'updates' topic.


* tb/geometric-repack (2021-02-03) 8 commits
 - builtin/repack.c: add '--geometric' option
 - packfile: add kept-pack cache for find_kept_pack_entry()
 - builtin/pack-objects.c: rewrite honor-pack-keep logic
 - p5303: measure time to repack with keep
 - p5303: add missing &&-chains
 - builtin/pack-objects.c: add '--stdin-packs' option
 - revision: learn '--no-kept-objects'
 - packfile: introduce 'find_kept_pack_entry()'

 "git repack" so far has been only capable of repacking everything
 under the sun into a single pack (or split by size).  A cleverer
 strategy to reduce the cost of repacking a repository has been
 introduced.


* ah/rebase-no-fork-point-config (2021-01-21) 1 commit
 - rebase: add a config option for --no-fork-point

 "git rebase --[no-]fork-point" gained a configuration variable
 rebase.forkPoint so that users do not have to keep specifying a
 non-default setting.

 Expecting a reroll to update its tests.

* js/range-diff-wo-dotdot (2021-02-06) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-08 at 9ae8b46d99)
 + range-diff(docs): explain how to specify commit ranges
 + range-diff/format-patch: handle commit ranges other than A..B
 + range-diff/format-patch: refactor check for commit range

 There are other ways than ".." for a single token to denote a
 "commit range", namely "<rev>^!" and "<rev>^-<n>", but "git
 range-diff" did not understand them.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jx/t5411-unique-filenames (2021-01-22) 2 commits
 - t5411: refactor check of refs using test_cmp_refs
 - t5411: use different out file to prevent overwriting

 Avoid individual tests in t5411 from getting affected by each other
 by forcing them to use separate output files during the test.


* jt/transfer-fsck-across-packs (2021-01-25) 5 commits
 - SQUASH??? test fix
 - fetch-pack: print and use dangling .gitmodules
 - fetch-pack: with packfile URIs, use index-pack arg
 - http-fetch: allow custom index-pack args
 - http: allow custom index-pack args

 The approach to "fsck" the incoming objects in "index-pack" is
 attractive for performance reasons (we have them already in core,
 inflated and ready to be inspected), but fundamentally cannot be
 applied fully when we receive more than one pack stream, as a tree
 object in one pack may refer to a blob object in another pack as
 ".gitmodules", when we want to inspect blobs that are used as
 ".gitmodules" file, for example.  Teach "index-pack" to emit
 objects that must be inspected later and check them in the calling
 "fetch-pack" process.


* jv/upload-pack-filter-spec-quotefix (2021-02-02) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-03 at 2e34f74e3a)

 Fix in passing custom args from "git clone" to "upload-pack" on the
 other side.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 (this branch is used by en/merge-ort-perf.)

 ORT merge strategy learns to infer "renamed directory" while
 merging.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* bc/signed-objects-with-both-hashes (2021-02-09) 7 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - gpg-interface: remove other signature headers before verifying
 - ref-filter: hoist signature parsing
 - commit: allow parsing arbitrary buffers with headers
 - gpg-interface: improve interface for parsing tags
 - commit: ignore additional signatures when parsing signed commits
 - ref-filter: switch some uses of unsigned long to size_t

 Signed commits and tags now allow verification of objects, whose
 two object names (one in SHA-1, the other in SHA-256) are both
 signed.

 Looking good.

 Introduce an on-disk file to record revindex for packdata, which
 traditionally was always created on the fly and only in-core.

 Will merge to 'master'.

* ak/corrected-commit-date (2021-01-18) 11 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-01-26 at deae33ec7d)
 + doc: add corrected commit date info

 + commit-graph: fix regression when computing Bloom filters
 (this branch is used by ds/chunked-file-api, ds/commit-graph-genno-fix and ds/merge-base-independent.)

 The commit-graph learned to use corrected commit dates instead of
 the generation number to help topological revision traversal.

 Will merge to 'master' together with ds/commit-graph-genno-fix.

* jt/clone-unborn-head (2021-02-05) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-08 at 3ba9f80e7f)
 + clone: respect remote unborn HEAD
 + connect, transport: encapsulate arg in struct
 + ls-refs: report unborn targets of symrefs

 "git clone" tries to locally check out the branch pointed at by
 HEAD of the remote repository after it is done, but the protocol
 did not convey the information necessary to do so when copying an
 empty repository.  The protocol v2 learned how to do so.

 Will merge to 'master'.
