What's cooking in git.git (Sep 2020, #03; Wed, 9)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'seen' (formerly 'pu'---proposed updates) while commits prefixed
with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches of the
repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

[Graduated to 'master']

* es/worktree-repair (2020-08-31) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-31 at 604825c5e4)
 + init: make --separate-git-dir work from within linked worktree
 + init: teach --separate-git-dir to repair linked worktrees
 + worktree: teach "repair" to fix outgoing links to worktrees
 + worktree: teach "repair" to fix worktree back-links to main worktree
 + worktree: add skeleton "repair" command

 "git worktree" gained a "repair" subcommand to help users recover
 after moving the worktrees or repository manually without telling
 Git.  Also, "git init --separate-git-dir" no longer corrupts
 administrative data related to linked worktrees.


* hv/ref-filter-misc (2020-08-28) 8 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-02 at 9a8bb84f20)
 + ref-filter: add `sanitize` option for 'subject' atom
 + pretty: refactor `format_sanitized_subject()`
 + ref-filter: add `short` modifier to 'parent' atom
 + ref-filter: add `short` modifier to 'tree' atom
 + ref-filter: rename `objectname` related functions and fields
 + ref-filter: modify error messages in `grab_objectname()`
 + ref-filter: refactor `grab_objectname()`
 + ref-filter: support different email formats

 The "--format=" option to the "for-each-ref" command and friends
 learned a few more tricks, e.g. the ":short" suffix that applies to
 "objectname" now also can be used for "parent", "tree", etc.


* jk/worktree-check-clean-leakfix (2020-08-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-31 at 220fc43629)
 + worktree: fix leak in check_clean_worktree()

 Leakfix.


* js/ci-squelch-false-failure (2020-09-02) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-03 at 254f390305)
 + ci: avoid ugly "failure" in the `ci-config` job
 + ci: fix indentation of the `ci-config` job

 CI noise reduction.


* jt/interpret-branch-name-fallback (2020-09-02) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-03 at 28914ab788)
 + wt-status: tolerate dangling marks
 + refs: move dwim_ref() to header file
 + sha1-name: replace unsigned int with option struct

 "git status" has trouble showing where it came from by interpreting
 reflog entries that recordcertain events, e.g. "checkout @{u}", and
 gives a hard/fatal error.  Even though it inherently is impossible
 to give a correct answer because the reflog entries lose some
 information (e.g. "@{u}" does not record what branch the user was
 on hence which branch 'the upstream' needs to be computed, and even
 if the record were available, the relationship between branches may
 have changed), at least hide the error to allow "status" show its
 output.


* os/vcbuild (2020-09-08) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-08 at 56551401c2)
 + contrib/buildsystems: fix expat library name for generated vcxproj
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-03 at 0216ec9cb9)
 + vcbuild: fix batch file name in README
 + vcbuild: fix library name for expat with make MSVC=1

 Fix build procedure for MSVC.


* pb/imap-send-updates (2020-08-31) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-02 at 899fca3919)
 + git-imap-send.txt: add note about localized Gmail folders
 + git-imap-send.txt: do verify SSL certificate for gmail.com
 + git-imap-send.txt: don't duplicate 'Examples' sections

 "git imap-send" updates.


* so/separate-field-for-m-and-diff-merges (2020-08-31) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-31 at 8def2984ca)
 + revision: add separate field for "-m" of "diff-index -m"

 Internal API clean-up to handle two options "diff-index" and "log"
 have, which happen to share the same short form, more sensibly.


* ss/submodule-summary-in-c (2020-08-12) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-17 at 9bc352cb70)
 + submodule: port submodule subcommand 'summary' from shell to C
 + t7421: introduce a test script for verifying 'summary' output
 + submodule: rename helper functions to avoid ambiguity
 + submodule: remove extra line feeds between callback struct and macro
 (this branch is used by ss/submodule-summary-in-c-fixes.)

 Yet another subcommand of "git submodule" is getting rewritten in C.


* ss/submodule-summary-in-c-fixes (2020-08-27) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-02 at 7f959811b8)
 + t7421: eliminate 'grep' check in t7421.4 for mingw compatibility
 + submodule: fix style in function definition
 + submodule: eliminate unused parameters from print_submodule_summary()
 (this branch uses ss/submodule-summary-in-c.)

 Fixups to a topic in 'next'.


* tb/repack-clearing-midx (2020-08-28) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-28 at 4204c0cb5e)
 + midx: traverse the local MIDX first
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-27 at a465875cbb)
 + builtin/repack.c: invalidate MIDX only when necessary

 When a packfile is removed by "git repack", multi-pack-index gets
 cleared; the code was taught to do so less aggressively by first
 checking if the midx actually refers to a pack that no longer
 exists.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* al/t3200-back-on-a-branch (2020-09-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-09 at 833e2fc60c)
 + t3200: clean side effect of git checkout --orphan

 Test fix.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* bc/rev-parse-path-format (2020-09-08) 1 commit
 - rev-parse: add option for absolute or relative path formatting

 "git rev-parse" can be explicitly told to give output as absolute
 or relative path.


* ds/maintenance-part-3 (2020-09-06) 6 commits

 - maintenance: add start/stop subcommands
 - maintenance: add [un]register subcommands
 - for-each-repo: run subcommands on configured repos
 - maintenance: add --schedule option and config
 - maintenance: optionally skip --auto process
 (this branch uses ds/maintenance-part-1 and ds/maintenance-part-2.)

 Parts of "git maintenance" to ease writing crontab entries (and
 other scheduling system configuration) for it.


* ea/blame-use-oideq (2020-09-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-09 at babefe4727)
 + blame.c: replace instance of !oidcmp for oideq

 Code cleanup.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* es/format-patch-interdiff-cleanup (2020-09-08) 3 commits
 - format-patch: use 'origin' as start of current-series-range when known
 - diff-lib: tighten show_interdiff()'s interface
 - diff: move show_interdiff() from its own file to diff-lib

 Code cleanup with a slight behaviour change when "format-patch
 --range-diff=<prev> origin..HEAD" gives a single revision to
 <prev>.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* es/wt-add-detach (2020-09-06) 3 commits
 - git-worktree.txt: discuss branch-based vs. throwaway worktrees
 - worktree: teach `add` to recognize -d as shorthand for --detach
 - git-checkout.txt: document -d short option for --detach

 "git worktree add" learns the "--detach" option to create a new
 worktree without being on a branch.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* hn/refs-ref-log-only-bit (2020-09-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-09 at f729cb2c81)
 + refs: move REF_LOG_ONLY to refs-internal.h

 A bit of API reshuffling to make sure stuff common to all backends
 are not defined only in files backend.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/add-i-use-builtin-experimental (2020-09-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-09 at abcb7515dc)
 + add -i: use the built-in version when feature.experimental is set

 The "add -i/-p" machinery has been written in C but it is not used
 by default yet.  It is made default to those who are participating
 in feature.experimental experiment.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/quote-path-cleanup (2020-09-08) 6 commits
 - quote: turn 'nodq' parameter into a set of flags
 - quote: rename misnamed sq_lookup[] to cq_lookup[]
 - wt-status: consistently quote paths in "status --short" output
 - quote_path: optionally allow quoting a path with SP in it
 - quote_path: give flags parameter to quote_path()
 - quote_path: rename quote_path_relative() to quote_path()

 "git status --short" quoted a path with SP in it when tracked, but
 not those that are untracked, ignored or unmerged.  They are all
 shown quoted consistently.

 Undecided.
 This is more involved than alternatives proposed by brian and Réne
 and I am not sure extra changes to the codebase is a net positive.

 The first step to remove on-disk binaries for built-in subcommands
 by soliciting objections.

 On hold for now.


* dr/push-remoteref-fix (2020-04-23) 1 commit
 - remote.c: fix handling of %(push:remoteref)

 The "%(push:remoteref)" placeholder in the "--format=" argument of
 "git format-patch" (and friends) only showed what got explicitly
 configured, not what ref at the receiving end would be updated when
 "git push" was used, as it ignored the default behaviour (e.g. update
 the same ref as the source).

 Expecting a reroll.

 - zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

 The "hooks defined in config" topic.


* ls/mergetool-meld-auto-merge (2020-09-09) 1 commit
 - Support auto-merge for meld to follow the vim-diff behavior

 The 'meld' backend of the "git mergetool" learned to give the
 underlying 'meld' the '--auto-merge' option, which would help
 reduce the amount of text that requires manual merging.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* mf/submodule-summary-with-correct-repository (2020-06-24) 2 commits
 - submodule: use submodule repository when preparing summary
 - revision: use repository from rev_info when parsing commits

 "git diff/show" on a change that involves a submodule used to read
 the information on commits in the submodule from a wrong repository
 and gave a wrong information when the commit-graph is involved.

 Will merge to 'next'.

* pb/clang-json-compilation-database (2020-09-06) 1 commit

 "git grep" has been tweaked to be limited to the sparse checkout
 paths.


* ew/decline-core-abbrev (2020-09-01) 1 commit
 - core.abbrev <off|false|no> disables abbreviations

 Allow the configuration to specify no abbreviation regardless of
 the hash algorithm.

* js/no-builtins-on-disk-option (2020-08-24) 3 commits
 - ci: stop linking built-ins to the dashed versions
 - install: optionally skip linking/copying the built-ins
 - msvc: copy the correct `.pdb` files in the Makefile target `install`

 The installation procedure learned to optionally omit "git-foo"
 executable files for each 'foo' built-in subcommand, which are only
 required by old timers that still rely on the age old promise that
 prepending "git --exec-path" output to PATH early in their script
 will keep the "git-foo" calls they wrote working.

 The old attempt to remove these executables from the disk failed in
 the 1.6 era; it may be worth attempting again, but I think it is
 worth to keep this topic separate from such a policy change to help
 it graduate early.

 Expecting a reroll to update log message for the last one.
 as it confused at least two reviewers.

 A "git gc"'s big brother has been introduced to take care of more
 repository maintenance tasks, not limited to the object database
 cleaning.

* jc/remove-pack-redundant (2020-08-25) 1 commit
 . pack-redundant: gauge the usage before proposing its removal

 The first step to remove "git pack-redundant" by soliciting
 objections.

 Stop--we had some activity as late as last year.
