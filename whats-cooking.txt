What's cooking in git.git (Jul 2018, #01; Wed, 11)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

The tip of 'next' has been rewound and it currently has only 4
topics.  Quite a many topics are cooking in 'pu' and need to be
sifted into good bins (for 'next') and the remainder.  Help is
appreciated in that area ;-)

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* ag/rebase-i-in-c (2018-07-10) 13 commits
 - rebase -i: rewrite the rest of init_revisions_and_shortrevisions in C
 - rebase -i: implement the logic to initialize the variable $revision in C
 - rebase--interactive: remove unused modes and functions
 - rebase--interactive: rewrite complete_action() in C
 - sequencer: change the way skip_unnecessary_picks() returns its result
 - sequencer: refactor append_todo_help() to write its message to a buffer
 - rebase -i: rewrite checkout_onto() in C

 Piecemeal rewrite of the remaining "rebase -i" machinery in C.  

 Expecting a reroll.

 The early parts of the series seem solidifying; perhaps with a
 reroll or two, they become 'next' material?

* bc/send-email-auto-cte (2018-07-09) 4 commits
 - docs: correct RFC specifying email line length
 - send-email: automatically determine transfer-encoding
 - send-email: accept long lines with suitable transfer encoding
 - send-email: add an auto option for transfer encoding

 The content-transfer-encoding of the message "git send-email" sends
 out by default was 8bit, which can cause trouble when there is an
 overlong line to bust RFC 5322/2822 limit.  A new option 'auto' to
 automatically switch to quoted-printable when there is such a line
 in the payload has been introduced and is made the default.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* en/dirty-merge-fixes (2018-07-11) 9 commits
 - merge: fix misleading pre-merge check documentation
 - merge-recursive: enforce rule that index matches head before merging
 - t6044: add more testcases with staged changes before a merge is invoked
 - merge-recursive: fix assumption that head tree being merged is HEAD
 - merge-recursive: make sure when we say we abort that we actually abort
 - t6044: add a testcase for index matching head, when head doesn't match HEAD
 - t6044: verify that merges expected to abort actually abort
 - index_has_changes(): avoid assuming operating on the_index
 - read-cache.c: move index_has_changes() from merge.c

 The recursive merge strategy did not properly ensure there was no
 change between HEAD and the index before performing its operation,
 which has been corrected.

 Test clean-up and corrections.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/empty-pick-fix (2018-07-11) 2 commits
 - sequencer: don't say BUG on bogus input
 - sequencer: handle empty-set cases consistently

 Handling of an empty range by "git cherry-pick" was inconsistent
 depending on how the range ended up to be empty, which has been
 corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/fetch-all-peeled-fix (2018-07-06) 1 commit
 - t5500: prettify non-commit tag tests

 Test modernization.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 - ref-filter: avoid backend filtering with --ignore-case
 - for-each-ref: consistently pass WM_IGNORECASE flag
 - t6300: add a test for --ignore-case

 The "--ignore-case" option of "git for-each-ref" (and its friends)
 did not work correctly, which has been fixed.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/fsck-gitmodules-gently (2018-07-03) 5 commits
 - fsck: silence stderr when parsing .gitmodules
 - fsck: silence stderr when parsing .gitmodules
 - config: add options parameter to git_config_from_mem
 - config: add CONFIG_ERROR_SILENT handler
 - config: turn die_on_error into caller-facing enum

 What's the status of this one?


* js/range-diff (2018-07-09) 20 commits
 - range-diff: make --dual-color the default mode
 - range-diff: left-pad patch numbers

 - range-diff: first rudimentary implementation
 - Introduce `range-diff` to compare iterations of a topic branch
 - linear-assignment: a function to solve least-cost assignment problems

 "git tbdiff" that lets us compare individual patches in two
 iterations of a topic has been rewritten and made into a built-in
 command.

 Supersedes js/branch-diff topic that added a similar command under
 a different name.


* jt/commit-graph-per-object-store (2018-07-09) 6 commits
 . commit-graph: add repo arg to graph readers
 . commit-graph: store graph in struct object_store
 . commit-graph: add free_commit_graph
 . commit-graph: add missing forward declaration
 . object-store: add missing include
 . commit-graph: refactor preparing commit graph
 (this branch uses ds/commit-graph-fsck.)

 The singleton commit-graph in-core instance is made per in-core
 repository instance.

 Expecting a reroll, as it breaks 32-bit build.
 cf. https://travis-ci.org/git/git/jobs/402422108
 

* jt/partial-clone-fsck-connectivity (2018-07-09) 2 commits
 - clone: check connectivity even if clone is partial
 - upload-pack: send refs' objects despite "filter"
 (this branch uses bw/ref-in-want and jt/connectivity-check-after-unshallow.)

 Partial clone support of "git clone" has been updated to correctly
 validate the objects it receives from the other side.  The server
 side has been corrected to send objects that are directly
 requested, even if they may match the filtering criteria (e.g. when
 doing a "lazy blob" partial clone).

 Will merge to 'next'.


* kg/gc-auto-windows-workaround (2018-07-09) 1 commit
 - gc --auto: release pack files before auto packing

 "git gc --auto" opens file descriptors for the packfiles before
 spawning "git repack/prune", which would upset Windows that does
 not want a process to work on a file that is open by another
 process.  The issue has been worked around.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* kn/userdiff-php (2018-07-06) 2 commits
 - userdiff: support new keywords in PHP hunk header
 - t4018: add missing test cases for PHP

 The userdiff pattern for .php has been updated.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* lt/date-human (2018-07-09) 1 commit
 - Add 'human' date format


* mh/fast-import-no-diff-delta-empty (2018-07-06) 1 commit
 - fast-import: do not call diff_delta() with empty buffer

 "git fast-import" has been updated to avoid attempting to create
 delta against a zero-byte-long string, which is pointless.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ot/ref-filter-object-info (2018-07-09) 4 commits
 . ref-filter: use oid_object_info() to get object
 . ref-filter: merge get_obj and get_object
 . ref-filter: add empty values to technical fields
 . ref-filter: add info_source to valid_atom

 Expecting a reroll, as it breaks compilation with uninitialized var.
 cf. https://travis-ci.org/git/git/jobs/402422102


* pk/rebase-in-c (2018-07-09) 4 commits
 - builtin/rebase: support running "git rebase <upstream>"
 - sequencer: refactor the code to detach HEAD to checkout.c
 - rebase: refactor common shell functions into their own file
 - rebase: start implementing it as a builtin

 Piecemeal rewrite of the "rebase" machinery in C.  

 Expecting a reroll, but it seems that this is getting quite close.

 Code clean-up.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* mk/merge-in-sparse-checkout (2018-07-11) 1 commit
 - unpack-trees: do not fail reset because of unmerged skipped entry

 "git reset --merge" (hence "git merge ---abort") and "git reset --hard"
 had trouble working correctly in a sparsely checked out working
 tree after a conflict, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.

* pw/add-p-select (2018-03-16) 3 commits
 - add -p: optimize line selection for short hunks
 - add -p: allow line selection to be inverted
 - add -p: select individual hunk lines

 "git add -p" interactive interface learned to let users choose
 individual added/removed lines to be used in the operation, instead
 of accepting or rejecting a whole hunk.

 Expecting a reroll to reignite the discussion.

* jh/json-writer (2018-06-13) 1 commit
 - json_writer: new routines to create JSON data

 Preparatory code to later add json output for unspecified telemetry
 data.

 We do not add random code that does not have real users to our
 codebase, so let's have it wait until such a real code materializes
 before too long.


* hn/bisect-first-parent (2018-04-21) 1 commit
 - bisect: create 'bisect_flags' parameter in find_bisection()

 Preliminary code update to allow passing more flags down the
 bisection codepath in the future.

 We do not add random code that does not have real users to our
 codebase, so let's have it wait until such a real code materializes
 before too long.

 - dir.c: update comments to match argument name

 Code clean-up on fsmonitor integration, plus optional utilization
 of the fsmonitor data in diff-files.

 Waiting for an update.

 I just rebased the topic to a newer base as it did not build
 standalone with the base I originally queued the topic on, but
 otherwise there is no update to address any of the review comments
 in the thread above---we are still waiting for a reroll.


* mk/http-backend-content-length (2018-06-11) 3 commits
 - http-backend: respect CONTENT_LENGTH for receive-pack
 - http-backend: respect CONTENT_LENGTH as specified by rfc3875
 - http-backend: cleanup writing to child process

 The http-backend (used for smart-http transport) used to slurp the
 whole input until EOF, without paying attention to CONTENT_LENGTH
 that is supplied in the environment and instead expecting the Web
 server to close the input stream.  This has been fixed.


* jk/drop-ancient-curl (2017-08-09) 5 commits
 - http: #error on too-old curl
 - curl: remove ifdef'd code never used with curl >=7.19.4
 - http: drop support for curl < 7.19.4
 - http: drop support for curl < 7.16.0
 - http: drop support for curl < 7.11.1

 Some code in http.c that has bitrot is being removed.

 Expecting a reroll.


* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2017-08-10) 1 commit
 . zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

 Needs resurrecting by making sure the fix is good and still applies
 (or adjusted to today's codebase).

* ao/config-from-gitmodules (2018-06-26) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-11 at 5d88dc6fb7)

* jt/connectivity-check-after-unshallow (2018-07-03) 1 commit
 - fetch-pack: write shallow, then check connectivity
 (this branch is used by jt/partial-clone-fsck-connectivity; uses bw/ref-in-want.)

 "git fetch" failed to correctly validate the set of objects it
 received when making a shallow history deeper, which has been
 corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jt/fetch-nego-tip (2018-07-03) 1 commit
 - fetch-pack: support negotiation tip whitelist
 (this branch uses jt/fetch-pack-negotiator.)

 "git fetch" learned a new option "--negotiation-tip" to limit the
 set of commits it tells the other end as "have", to reduce wasted
 bandwidth and cycles, which would be helpful when the receiving
 repository has a lot of refs that have little to do with the
 history at the remote it is fetching from.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* mb/filter-branch-optim (2018-06-26) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-11 at e43a0136c2)
 + filter-branch: skip commits present on --state-branch

 "git filter-branch" when used with the "--state-branch" option
 still attempted to rewrite the commits whose filtered result is
 known from the previous attempt (which is recorded on the state
 branch); the command has been corrected not to waste cycles doing
 so.

 Will merge to 'master'.

  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-11 at 985f88cf7e)
 + fsck: check skiplist for object in fsck_blob()

 "fsck.skipList" did not prevent a blob object listed there from
 being inspected for is contents (e.g. we recently started to
 inspect the contents of ".gitmodules" for certain malicious
 patterns), which has been corrected.

 remote tracking branch in a repository with multiple remotes that
 have tracking branches that share the same names.

 - mem-pool: only search head block for available space
 - block alloc: add lifecycle APIs for cache_entry structs

 For a large tree, the index needs to hold many cache entries
 allocated on heap.  These cache entries are now allocated out of a
 dedicated memory pool to amortize malloc(3) overhead.

 This makes each cache-entry larger by either 4 or 8 bytes, which is

  (merged to 'next' on 2018-06-29 at fac676dfb9)
 + branch: deprecate "-l" option
 + t: switch "branch -l" to "branch --create-reflog"
 + t3200: unset core.logallrefupdates when testing reflog creation
 (this branch is used by jk/branch-l-1-repurpose.)

 The "-l" option in "git branch -l" is an unfortunate short-hand for
 "--create-reflog", but many users, both old and new, somehow expect
 it to be something else, perhaps "--list".  This step warns when "-l"
 is used as a short-hand for "--create-reflog" and warns about the
 future repurposing of the it when it is used.

 Retracted to be replaced with a more vertical approach where the
 lower-level helper functions are taught to be capable of working on
 an istate instance that is not the_index first, and then upwards to
 support the application layer that wants to work on an arbitrary
 istate instance, as the goal is not a mechanical replacement of
 foo_cache(...) to foo_index(&the_index, ...).
