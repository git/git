What's cooking in git.git (Jan 2012, #06; Fri, 27)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with '+' are in
'next'.

Now 1.7.9 is out, the development cycle for 1.7.10 will start shortly.

Here are the repositories that have my integration branches:

With maint, master, next, pu, todo:

        git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git
        git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git
        https://code.google.com/p/git-core/
        https://github.com/git/git

With only maint and master:

        git://git.sourceforge.jp/gitroot/git-core/git.git
        git://git-core.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/git-core/git-core

With all the topics and integration branches:

        https://github.com/gitster/git

The preformatted documentation in HTML and man format are found in:

* jc/advise-push-default (2011-12-18) 1 commit
 - push: hint to use push.default=upstream when appropriate

Peff had a good suggestion outlining an updated code structure so that
somebody new can try to dip his or her toes in the development. Any
takers?

Waiting for a reroll.

* mh/ref-api-rest (2011-12-12) 35 commits
 . repack_without_ref(): call clear_packed_ref_cache()
 . read_packed_refs(): keep track of the directory being worked in
 . is_refname_available(): query only possibly-conflicting references
 . refs: read loose references lazily
 . read_loose_refs(): take a (ref_entry *) as argument
 . struct ref_dir: store a reference to the enclosing ref_cache

 . search_ref_dir(): take (ref_entry *) instead of (ref_dir *)
 . find_containing_direntry(): use (ref_entry *) instead of (ref_dir *)

 . do_for_each_ref(): only iterate over the subtree that was requested
 . refs: sort ref_dirs lazily

 . do_for_each_ref_in_arrays(): new function
 . do_for_each_ref_in_array(): new function
 . do_for_each_ref(): correctly terminate while processesing extra_refs

I had to remove this temporarily out of 'pu' as I didn't want to deal with
merge conflicts with the mh/ref-clone-without-extra-refs topic that
removes yet another caller of add_extra_ref() that this series touches.

Will defer till the next cycle.

* ss/git-svn-prompt-sans-terminal (2012-01-04) 3 commits
 - fixup! 15eaaf4
 - git-svn, perl/Git.pm: extend Git::prompt helper for querying users
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-01-05 at 954f125)
 + perl/Git.pm: "prompt" helper to honor GIT_ASKPASS and SSH_ASKPASS

The bottom one has been replaced with a rewrite based on comments from
Ævar. The second one needs more work, both in perl/Git.pm and prompt.c, to
give precedence to tty over SSH_ASKPASS when terminal is available.

Will defer till the next cycle.

* nd/commit-ignore-i-t-a (2012-01-16) 2 commits
 - commit, write-tree: allow to ignore CE_INTENT_TO_ADD while writing trees
 - cache-tree: update API to take abitrary flags

May want to consider this as fixing an earlier UI mistake, and not as a
feature that devides the userbase.

Will defer till the next cycle.

* jc/split-blob (2012-01-24) 6 commits
 - chunked-object: streaming checkout
 - chunked-object: fallback checkout codepaths
 - bulk-checkin: support chunked-object encoding
 - bulk-checkin: allow the same data to be multiply hashed
 - new representation types in the packstream
 - varint-in-pack: refactor varint encoding/decoding

Not ready.

I finished the streaming checkout codepath, but as explained in 127b177
(bulk-checkin: support chunked-object encoding, 2011-11-30), these are
still early steps of a long and painful journey. At least pack-objects and
fsck need to learn the new encoding for the series to be usable locally,
and then index-pack/unpack-objects needs to learn it to be used remotely.

Given that I heard a lot of noise that people want large files, and that I
was asked by somebody at GitTogether'11 privately for an advice on how to
pay developers (not me) to help adding necessary support, I am somewhat
dissapointed that the original patch series that was sent almost two
months ago still remains here without much comments and updates from the
developer community. I even made the interface to the logic that decides
where to split chunks easily replaceable, and I deliberately made the
logic in the original patch extremely stupid to entice others, especially
the "bup" fanboys, to come up with a better logic, thinking that giving
people an easy target to shoot for, they may be encouraged to help
out. The plan is not working :-(.

* jl/test-pause (2012-01-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-01-20 at ee56335)
 + test-lib: add the test_pause convenience function

Looked reasonable.
Will merge early in the next cycle.

* mh/ref-clone-without-extra-refs (2012-01-17) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-01-20 at 2e9645e)
 + write_remote_refs(): create packed (rather than extra) refs
 + add_packed_ref(): new function in the refs API.
 + ref_array: keep track of whether references are sorted

Looked reasonable; will hopefully help making mh/ref-api-rest simpler and
cleaner.

Will merge early in the next cycle.

  (merged to 'next' on 2012-01-23 at 7bc2e0a)

  (merged to 'next' on 2012-01-23 at 694a94e)

  (merged to 'next' on 2012-01-23 at f927323)
 + mergetool: Provide an empty file when needed

Caters to GUI merge backends that cannot merge two files without
a base by giving them an empty file as a "pretend" common ancestor.

Will merge early in the next cycle and deal with any fallout in 'master'.

* jc/maint-log-first-parent-pathspec (2012-01-19) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-01-20 at fb2b35f)
 + Making pathspec limited log play nicer with --first-parent

A bugfix.
Will merge early in the next cycle.

* ld/git-p4-branches-and-labels (2012-01-20) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-01-23 at 9020ec4)
 + git-p4: label import fails with multiple labels at the same changelist
 + git-p4: add test for p4 labels
 + git-p4: importing labels should cope with missing owner
 + git-p4: cope with labels with empty descriptions
 + git-p4: handle p4 branches and labels containing shell chars
 (this branch is used by va/git-p4-branch.)

Will merge early in the next cycle.

* jc/pull-signed-tag (2012-01-23) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-01-23 at 4257553)
 + merge: use editor by default in interactive sessions

Per Linus's strong suggestion, sugarcoated (aka "taking blame for the
original UI screw-ups") so that it is easier for me to swallow and accept
a potentially huge backward incompatibility issue, "git merge" is made to
launch an editor to explain the merge in the merge commit by default in
interactive sessions.

I've updated the special-case environment variable to MERGE_AUTOEDIT that
scripts can set to "no" when they start. There is no plan to encourage
humans to keep using the historical behaviour, hence there is no support
for configuration variable (e.g. merge.autoedit) that can be set to 'no'.
Oh, also I updated the documentation a bit.

Will merge early in the next cycle and deal with any fallout in 'master'.

* nd/maint-refname-in-hierarchy-check (2012-01-11) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-01-20 at acb5611)
 + Fix incorrect ref namespace check

Avoid getting confused by "ref/headxxx" and mistaking it as if it is under
the "refs/heads/" hierarchy.
Will merge early in the next cycle.

* jc/advise-i18n (2011-12-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-01-23 at 6447013)
 + i18n of multi-line advice messages

Allow localization of advice messages that tend to be longer and
multi-line formatted. For now this is deliberately limited to advise()
interface and not vreportf() in general as touching the latter has
interactions with error() that has plumbing callers whose prefix "error: "
should never be translated.

Will merge early in the next cycle.

* rr/sequencer (2012-01-11) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-01-23 at f349b56)

primarily to prepare for the next cycle.

Will merge early in the next cycle.

  (merged to 'next' on 2012-01-20 at 278fae1)

Looked reasonable.

  (merged to 'next' on 2012-01-23 at 9cab64e)

 + clone: delay cloning until after remote HEAD checking
 + clone: factor out remote ref writing
 + clone: factor out HEAD update code
 + clone: factor out checkout code
 + clone: write detached HEAD in bare repositories
 + t5601: add missing && cascade
 (this branch uses nd/clone-single-branch.)

Applied two band-aids to a corner-case regression.

These are a bit scary changes, but I do think they are worth doing.
