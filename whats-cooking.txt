What's cooking in git.git (Nov 2024, #06; Thu, 14)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and
aren't considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL
to a message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity (of course they can be resubmit when new interests
arise).

A few commits to update git-gui are in.  There are still too many
topics that are left unreviewed, and the 'next' branch is not
gaining topics as quickly as it usually would.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-scm/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

 "git gc" discards any objects that are outside promisor packs that
 are referred to by an object in a promisor pack, and we do not
 refetch them from the promisor at runtime, resulting an unusable
 repository.  Work it around by including these objects in the
 referring promisor pack at the receiving end of the fetch.

 - promisor-remote: check advertised name or URL
 - Add 'promisor-remote' capability to protocol v2
 - strbuf: refactor strbuf_trim_trailing_ch()
 - version: refactor strbuf_sanitize()

 The v2 protocol learned to allow the server to advertise possible
 promisor remotes, and the client to respond with what promissor
 remotes it uses, so that the server side can omit objects that the
 client can lazily obtain from these other promissor remotes.

 Comments?  I got an impression that this is premature without
 finishing the discussion on a larger picture.

* sj/ref-contents-check (2024-11-11) 9 commits
 - ref: add symlink ref content check for files backend
 - ref: check whether the target of the symref is a ref
 - ref: add basic symref content check for files backend
 - ref: add more strict checks for regular refs
 - ref: port git-fsck(1) regular refs check for files backend
 - ref: support multiple worktrees check for refs
 - ref: initialize ref name outside of check functions
 - ref: check the full refname instead of basename
 - ref: initialize "fsck_ref_report" with zero

 "git fsck" learned to issue warnings on "curiously formatted" ref
 contents that have always been taken valid but something Git
 wouldn't have written itself (e.g., missing terminating end-of-line
 after the full object name).

 Comments?
