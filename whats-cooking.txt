What's cooking in git.git (Apr 2010, #03; Wed, 07)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones
marked with '.' do not appear in any of the integration branches, but I am
still holding onto them.

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* sg/bash-completion (2010-02-23) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-03-08 at bc59860)
 + bash: completion for gitk aliases
 + bash: support user-supplied completion scripts for aliases
 + bash: support user-supplied completion scripts for user's git commands
 + bash: improve aliased command recognition

Nobody seems to care about "_git_frotz" that may potentially crash with
whatever random things the end users is doing in their environment, and
renaming them to "_git_complete_frotz" to avoid that.  So let's not worry
about that.

* ic/bash-completion-rpm (2010-03-26) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-02 at 0358304)
 + RPM spec: include bash completion support

* da/maint-python-startup (2010-03-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-01 at ca6897a)
 + Makefile: Remove usage of deprecated Python "has_key" method

* jc/conflict-marker-size (2010-03-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-01 at 164b1f4)
 + diff --check: honor conflict-marker-size attribute

* sb/fmt-merge-msg (2010-03-24) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-01 at 5fcbec5)
 + fmt-merge-msg: hide summary option
 + fmt-merge-msg: remove custom string_list implementation
 + string-list: add unsorted_string_list_lookup()
 + fmt-merge-msg: use pretty.c routines
 + t6200: test fmt-merge-msg more
 + t6200: modernize with test_tick
 + fmt-merge-msg: be quiet if nothing to merge
 (this branch is used by jp/hold-sring-list-sanity.)

* ef/maint-empty-commit-log (2010-03-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-03-28 at aa103e5)
 + rev-list: fix --pretty=oneline with empty message

* jn/mailinfo-scissors (2010-04-03) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-05 at 366435a)
 + Teach mailinfo %< as an alternative scissors mark

* mg/notes-reflog (2010-03-29) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-06 at 1b8066f)
 + refs.c: Write reflogs for notes just like for branch heads
 + t3301-notes: Test the creation of reflog entries

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* eb/unpretty-b-format (2010-03-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-07 at 7f5c112)
 + Add `%B' in format strings for raw commit body in `git log' and friends

* ne/rev-cache (2010-04-05) 7 commits
 - graft awareness
 - object name support
 - integration into revision walker
 - administrative api and tools
 - support for non-commit objects
 - basic api and porcelain
 - man page and technical docs

For some reason this was extremely hard to read, partly because it had too
many distracting style violations and too many long lines.  I'll start
reading it later in the week when I find time to comment.

* jp/hold-sring-list-sanity (2010-04-06) 6 commits
 . string_list: Fix argument order for string_list_append
 . string_list: Fix argument order for string_list_lookup
 . string_list: Fix argument order for string_list_insert_at_index
 . string_list: Fix argument order for string_list_insert
 . string_list: Fix argument order for for_each_string_list
 . string_list: Fix argument order for print_string_list
 (this branch uses js/grep-open and sr/remote-helper-export.)

Building this on top of slushy codebase is not a very promising endeavor.
Good thing to do, but bad timing.

* ab/commit-empty-message (2010-04-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-07 at 701e863)
 + Add option to git-commit to allow empty log messages

* jc/test-sleepless (2010-04-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-07 at 8ccf40a)
 + war on "sleep" in tests

* jc/maint-reflog-expire-unreachable (2010-04-07) 2 commits
 - reflog --expire-unreachable: a side note
 - reflog --expire-unreachable: avoid merge-base computation

* jc/doc-submit-gmail (2010-04-07) 1 commit
 - SubmittingPatches: update GMail section

* tc/maint-curl-helper (2010-04-08) 1 commit
 - remote-curl: avoid double-slashes in HTTP requests

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* js/rebase-origin-x (2010-02-05) 1 commit
 - [RFC w/o test and incomplete] rebase: add -x option to record original commit name

I retract my objection against the idea of -x; needs polishing before
moving forward.

* js/grep-open (2010-03-26) 2 commits
 - grep -O: allow optional argument specifying the pager (or editor)
 - grep: Add the option '--open-files-in-pager'
 (this branch is used by jp/hold-sring-list-sanity.)

Probably needs to support --no-index mode as well.

* tr/word-diff (2010-04-04) 2 commits
 - gitk: add the equivalent of diff --color-words
 - diff: add --word-diff option that generalizes --color-words

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* np/malloc-threading (2010-04-07) 2 commits
 - Make xmalloc and xrealloc thread-safe (addendum)
 - Make xmalloc and xrealloc thread-safe

Updated with Freku's "init_recursive_mutex()".  The fix should eventually
go to 'maint' and 'master'.

* js/async-thread (2010-03-09) 7 commits
 - Enable threaded async procedures whenever pthreads is available
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-03-20 at 9939243)
 + Dying in an async procedure should only exit the thread, not the process.
 + Reimplement async procedures using pthreads
 + Windows: more pthreads functions
 + Fix signature of fcntl() compatibility dummy
 + Make report() from usage.c public as vreportf() and use it.

  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-06 at 992c9ad)

  (merged to 'next' on 2010-03-08 at 58a6fba)
 + log.decorate: usability fixes
 + Add `log.decorate' configuration variable.
 + git_config_maybe_bool()

I did the tip one myself.  An extra set or two of eyeballs would be
appreciated.

* mh/status-optionally-refresh (2010-04-03) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-05 at 0e64aac)

 + whitespace: add tab-in-indent error class
 + whitespace: we cannot "catch all errors known to git" anymore

* rr/remote-helper-doc (2010-04-07) 3 commits
 - Documentation/remote-helpers: Add invocation section
 - Documentation/urls: Rewrite to accomodate <transport>::<address>
 - Documentation/remote-helpers: Rewrite description

 + remote-helpers: allow requesing the path to the .git directory
 + fast-import: always create marks_file directories
 + clone: also configure url for bare clones

 (this branch is used by jp/hold-sring-list-sanity.)

* cc/revert-strategy (2010-03-31) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-05 at 50909c1)
 + revert: add "--strategy" option to choose merge strategy
 + merge: make function try_merge_command non static
 + merge: refactor code that calls "git merge-STRATEGY"
 + revert: refactor merge recursive code into its own function

  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-05 at 5ad036c)

 + GIT_ONE_FILESYSTEM: flip the default to stop at filesystem boundaries
 + Add support for GIT_ONE_FILESYSTEM

The tip one is a bit iffy; the whole series changes behaviour in a corner
case, and is not a 1.7.1 material.

* pc/remove-warn (2010-03-26) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-02 at 52fc00d)

  (merged to 'next' on 2010-03-28 at 86b6a4f)

Perhaps needs a bit of documentation updates, describing the "going open
source" scenario.

  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-07 at e50fd3a)

Rerolled.  I need to look at this series during the feature freeze so that
we can decide to (or not to) include it in 'next' early in post 1.7.1 cycle.
