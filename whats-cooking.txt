What's cooking in git.git (Aug 2020, #03; Thu, 13)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'seen' (formerly 'pu'---proposed updates) while commits prefixed
with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

We are at 7th batch.  I'm trying to merge smaller batches of topics
to the 'master' branch more often than the previous cycles.  I will
also experiment, for smaller topics, with shorter gestation period
in 'next' before merging them to the 'master' branch.  We'll see if
this lowers stability of the tip of 'master' significantly; not that
much, hopefully.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches of the
repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

* so/log-diff-merges-opt (2020-08-11) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-11 at 99e070bdca)
 + t/t4013: add test for --diff-merges=off
 + doc/git-log: describe --diff-merges=off
 + revision: change "--diff-merges" option to require parameter
 (this branch uses jk/log-fp-implies-m.)

 Earlier, to countermand the implicit "-m" option when the
 "--first-parent" option is used with "git log", we added the
 "--[no-]diff-merges" option in the jk/log-fp-implies-m topic.  To
 leave the door open to allow the "--diff-merges" option to take
 values that instructs how patches for merge commits should be
 computed (e.g. "cc"? "-p against first parent?"), redefine
 "--diff-merges" to take non-optional value, and implement "off"
 that means the same thing as "--no-diff-merges".

 Will merge to 'master' together with 'jk/lo-implies-m'.

 - t8003: factor setup out of coalesce test

 When given more than one target line ranges, "git blame -La,b

 - SQUASH???
 - Support auto-merge for meld to follow the vim-diff behavior

 The 'meld' backend of the "git mergetool" learned to give the
 underlying 'meld' the '--auto-merge' option, which would help
 reduce the amount of text that requires manual merging.

 . transport: not report a non-head push as a branch

 "git receive-pack" that accepts requests by "git push" learned to
 outsource most of the ref updates to the new "proc-receive" hook.

 - submodule: use submodule repository when preparing summary
 - revision: use repository from rev_info when parsing commits

 "git diff/show" on a change that involves a submodule used to read
 the information on commits in the submodule from a wrong repository
 and gave a wrong information when the commit-graph is involved.

* dr/push-remoteref-fix (2020-04-23) 1 commit
 - remote.c: fix handling of %(push:remoteref)

 The "%(push:remoteref)" placeholder in the "--format=" argument of
 "git format-patch" (and friends) only showed what got explicitly
 configured, not what ref at the receiving end would be updated when
 "git push" was used, as it ignored the default behaviour (e.g. update
 the same ref as the source).

 Recent versions of "git diff-files" shows a diff between the index
 and the working tree for "intent-to-add" paths as a "new file"
 patch; "git apply --cached" should be able to take "git diff-files"
 and should act as an equivalent to "git add" for the path, but the

 The logic to find the ref transaction hook script attempted to

 - init: disallow --separate-git-dir with bare repository

 The purpose of "git init --separate-git-dir" is to initialize a
 new project with the repository separate from the working tree,
 or, in the case of an existing project, to move the repository
 (the .git/ directory) out of the working tree. It does not make
 sense to use --separate-git-dir with a bare repository for which
 there is no working tree, so disallow its use with bare
 repositories.

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2020-08-01

 "git log --first-parent -p" showed patches only for single-parent
 commits on the first-parent chain; the "--first-parent" option has
 been made to imply "-m".  Use "--no-diff-merges" to restore the
 previous behaviour to omit patches for merge commits.

* mt/hash-to-hex-thread-safety (2020-06-26) 2 commits
 - hex: make hash_to_hex_algop() and friends thread-safe
 - compat/win32/pthread: add pthread_once()

 hash_to_hex() used a set of rotating static buffers, which was not
 safe to use in a threaded environment.  This has been made safer by
 using thread-local storage.

 Expecting a reroll.

 Now jk/strvec is in 'master', we may want to see the topic reworked
 on top of it.  Are there unresolved issues, or does the topic need
 a round of detailed review?
