What's cooking in git.git (Jun 2022, #01; Wed, 1)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen',
and aren't considered "accepted" at all.

This cycle will conclude in early July (https://tinyurl.com/gitCal);
we are in the week #6 of the cycle.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

Release tarballs are available at:

* ac/remote-v-with-object-list-filters (2022-05-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2022-05-20 at 8d2dc10d8f)
 + builtin/remote.c: teach `-v` to list filters for promisor remotes

* cb/path-owner-check-with-sudo (2022-05-12) 3 commits

 + git-compat-util: avoid failing dir ownership checks if running privileged
 + t: regression git needs safe.directory when using sudo
 (this branch is used by cb/path-owner-check-with-sudo-plus.)

 With a recent update to refuse access to repositories of other
 people by default, "sudo make install" and "sudo git describe"
 stopped working.  This series intends to loosen it while keeping
 the safety.

 With the new http.curloptResolve configuration, the CURLOPT_RESOLVE
 mechanism that allows cURL based applications to use pre-resolved
 IP addresses for the requests is exposed to the scripts.

 The tests that ensured merges stop when interfering local changes
 are present did not make sure that local changes are preserved; now
 they do.

 + push: new config option "push.autoSetupRemote" supports "simple" push
 + push: default to single remote even when not named origin
 + branch: new autosetupmerge option 'simple' for matching branches

 "git -c branch.autosetupmerge=simple branch $A $B" will set the $B
 as $A's upstream only when $A and $B shares the same name, and "git
 -c push.default=simple" on branch $A would push to update the
 branch $A at the remote $B came from.  Also more places use the
 sole remote, if exists, before defaulting to 'origin'.

  (merged to 'next' on 2022-05-31 at 2d65a13996)
 + pathspec: correct an empty string used as a pathspec element

 A git subcommand like "git add -p" spawns a separate git process
 while relaying its command line arguments.  A pathspec with only
 negative elements was mistakenly passed with an empty string, which
 has been corrected.

 - git-compat-util: allow root to access both SUDO_UID and root owned

 "sudo git foo" used to consider a repository owned by the original
 user a safe one to access; it now also considers a repository owned
 by root a safe one, too (after all, if an attacker can craft a
 malicious repository owned by root, the box is 0wned already).

 What's our take on this one?  IIRC, the last time we discussed,
 Carlo was hestant to push this step forward?

 In Git 2.36 we revamped the way how hooks are invoked.  One change
 that is end-user visible is that the output of a hook is no longer
 directly connected to the standard output of "git" that spawns the
 hook, which was noticed post release.  This is getting corrected.
