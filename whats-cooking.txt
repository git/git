What's cooking in git.git (Aug 2014, #04; Tue, 26)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.

The 'maint' branch now is for the 2.1.x maintenance track, and a few
fixes for recent regressions have been merged to 'maint' and 'master'.
The 'next' has been rewound, while kicking a couple of topics back
to 'pu' per topic owners' requests.  I still haven't caught up with
new topics and rerolls that came late in the last cycle yet but
hopefully I can in the coming days.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* jk/diff-tree-t-fix (2014-08-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-08-21 at 0f652d6)
 + intersect_paths: respect mode in git's tree-sort

 Fix (rarely used) "git diff-tree -t" regression in 2.0.


* jk/fix-profile-feedback-build (2014-08-19) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-08-21 at b282021)
 + Makefile: make perf tests optional for profile build

 Fix profile-feedback build broken in 2.1 for tarball releases.


* jk/pack-shallow-always-without-bitmap (2014-08-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-08-21 at e04c935)
 + pack-objects: turn off bitmaps when we see --shallow lines

 Reachability bitmaps do not work with shallow operations.
 Fixes regression in 2.0.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* et/spell-poll-infinite-with-minus-one-only (2014-08-22) 1 commit
 - upload-pack: keep poll(2)'s timeout to -1

 We used to pass -1000 to poll(2), expecting it to also mean "no
 timeout", which should be spelled as -1.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/make-simplify-dependencies (2014-08-25) 2 commits
 - Makefile: use `find` to determine static header dependencies
 - i18n: treat "make pot" as an explicitly-invoked target

 Admit that keeping LIB_H up-to-date, only for those that do not use
 the automatically generated dependencies, is a losing battle, and
 make it conservative by making everything depend on anything.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/prompt-stash-could-be-packed (2014-08-25) 1 commit
 - git-prompt: do not look for refs/stash in $GIT_DIR

 The prompt script checked $GIT_DIR/ref/stash file to see if there
 is a stash, which was a no-no.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/prune-top-level-refs-after-packing (2014-08-25) 1 commit
 - pack-refs: prune top-level refs like "refs/foo"

 After "pack-refs --prune" packed refs at the top-level, it failed
 to prune them.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/fast-import-fixes (2014-08-25) 2 commits
 - fast-import: fix buffer overflow in dump_tags
 - fast-import: clean up pack_data pointer in end_packfile

 With sufficiently long refnames, fast-import could have overflown
 an on-stack buffer.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* nd/fetch-pass-quiet-to-gc-child-process (2014-08-18) 2 commits
 - fetch: silence git-gc if --quiet is given
 - fetch: convert argv_gc_auto to struct argv_array

 Progress output from "git gc --auto" was visible in "git fetch -q".

 Will merge to 'next'.


* rs/list-optim (2014-08-25) 2 commits
 - walker: avoid quadratic list insertion in mark_complete
 - sha1_name: avoid quadratic list insertion in handle_one_ref

 Fix a couple of "accumulate into a sorted list" to "accumulate and
 then sort the list".

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sb/mailsplit-dead-code-removal (2014-08-13) 1 commit
 - mailsplit.c: remove dead code

 Will merge to 'next'.


* tb/pretty-format-cd-date-format (2014-08-21) 1 commit
 - pretty: note that %cd respects the --date= option

 Documentation update.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/name-decoration-alloc (2014-08-26) 3 commits
 - log-tree: use FLEX_ARRAY in name_decoration
 - log-tree: make name_decoration hash static
 - log-tree: make add_name_decoration a public function

 The API to allocate the structure to keep track of commit
 decoration was cumbersome to use, inviting lazy code to
 overallocate memory.

 Will merge to 'next'.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* cb/mergetool-difftool (2014-07-21) 2 commits
 - difftool: don't assume that default sh is sane
 - mergetool: don't require a work tree for --tool-help

 Update the way the "difftool --help" shows the help message that is
 shared with the "mergetool" to reduce one shell dependency.

 Will be rerolled.


* ta/config-add-to-empty-or-true-fix (2014-08-18) 1 commit
 - make config --add behave correctly for empty and NULL values

 Will be rerolled.


* rr/mergetool-temporary-filename-tweak (2014-08-21) 1 commit

 - t9903: move test name prefix to a separate variable
 - t9903: put the Bash pc mode prompt test cases in a function
 - t9903: remove Zsh test from the suite of Bash prompt tests

 Expecting a reroll to limit the damage to test_eval_; also reported
 to be broken with older zsh that are still in the field ($gmane/251231).


* ss/userdiff-update-csharp-java (2014-06-02) 2 commits
 - userdiff: support Java try keyword
 - userdiff: support C# async methods and correct C# keywords

 Expecting a reroll.


* bg/rebase-off-of-previous-branch (2014-04-16) 1 commit
 - git-rebase: print name of rev when using shorthand

 Teach "git rebase -" to report the concrete name of the branch
 (i.e. the previous one).

 But it stops short and does not do the same for "git rebase @{-1}".
 Expecting a reroll.


* tr/merge-recursive-index-only (2014-02-05) 3 commits
 - merge-recursive: -Xindex-only to leave worktree unchanged
 - merge-recursive: internal flag to avoid touching the worktree

 . merge-recursive: allow storing conflict hunks in index
 . revision: fold all merge diff variants into an enum merge_diff_mode
 . combine-diff: do not pass revs->dense_combined_merges redundantly
 (this branch uses tr/merge-recursive-index-only.)

 "log -p" output learns a new way to let users inspect a merge
 commit by showing the differences between the automerged result
 with conflicts the person who recorded the merge would have seen
 and the final conflict resolution that was recorded in the merge.

 Needs to be rebased, now kb/fast-hashmap topic is in.


* jk/makefile (2014-02-05) 16 commits
 . FIXUP

 Simplify the Makefile rules and macros that exist primarily for
 quoting purposes, and make it easier to robustly express the
 dependency rules.

 Expecting a reroll.


* po/everyday-doc (2014-01-27) 1 commit
 - Make 'git help everyday' work

 This may make the said command to emit something, but the source is
 not meant to be formatted into a manual pages to begin with, and
 also its contents are a bit stale.  It may be a good first step in
 the right direction, but needs more work to at least get the
 mark-up right before public consumption.

 Will hold.


* rb/merge-prepare-commit-msg-hook (2014-01-10) 4 commits
 - merge: drop unused arg from abort_commit method signature
 - merge: make prepare_to_commit responsible for write_merge_state
 - t7505: ensure cleanup after hook blocks merge
 - t7505: add missing &&

 Expose more merge states (e.g. $GIT_DIR/MERGE_MODE) to hooks that
 run during "git merge".  The log message stresses too much on one
 hook, prepare-commit-msg, but it would equally apply to other hooks
 like post-merge, I think.

 Waiting for a reroll.


* jc/graph-post-root-gap (2013-12-30) 3 commits
 - WIP: document what we want at the end
 - graph: remove unused code a bit
 - graph: stuff the current commit into graph->columns[]

 - perf-lib: add test_perf_cleanup target
 - perf-lib: split starting the test from the execution

 Add test_perf_cleanup shell function to the perf suite, that allows
 the script writers to define a test with a clean-up action.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* so/rebase-doc (2014-08-12) 1 commit
 - Documentation/git-rebase.txt: -f forces a rebase that would otherwise be a no-op

 May need description on what makes various modes of operation to
 decide that the request can become a "no-op".

 Will merge to 'next'.

 - send-pack: always send capabilities
 - send-pack: refactor decision to send update per ref
 - send-pack: move REF_STATUS_REJECT_NODELETE logic a bit higher
 - receive-pack: factor out queueing of command
 - receive-pack: do not reuse old_sha1[] for other things
 - receive-pack: parse feature request a bit earlier
 - receive-pack: do not overallocate command structure

 Allow "git push" request to be signed, so that it can be verified
 audited, using the GPG signature of the person who pushed, that the
 tips of branches at a public repository really point the commits
 the pusher wanted to, without having to "trust" the server.

 The tip two feels still a bit slushy, but otherwise should be
 reasonably solid to build upon.


* rs/child-process-init (2014-08-20) 4 commits
 - run-command: inline prepare_run_command_v_opt()
 - run-command: call run_command_v_opt_cd_env() instead of duplicating it

  (merged to 'next' on 2014-08-26 at 51fca1a)
 + archive: honor tar.umask even for pax headers

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2014-08-13

 Implementations of "tar" that do not understand an extended pax
 header would extract the contents of it in a regular file; make
 sure the permission bits of this file follows the same tar.umask
 configuration setting.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* bc/imap-send-doc (2014-08-05) 1 commit
 - imap-send doc: omit confusing "to use imap-send" modifier

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jc/apply-ws-prefix (2014-08-07) 3 commits
 - apply: omit ws check for excluded paths
 - apply: hoist use_patch() helper for path exclusion up
 - apply: use the right attribute for paths in non-Git patches

 Applying a patch not generated by Git in a subdirectory used to
 check the whitespace breakage using the attributes for incorrect
 paths. Also whitespace checks were performed even for paths
 excluded via "git apply --exclude=<path>" mechanism.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/command-line-config-empty-string (2014-08-05) 1 commit
 - config: teach "git -c" to recognize an empty string

 "git -c section.var command" and "git -c section.var= command"
 should pass the configuration differently (the former should be
 a boolean true, the latter should be an empty string).

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/pack-bitmap (2014-08-04) 1 commit
 - pack-bitmap: do not use gcc packed attribute

 Hold, waiting for Karsten's replacement.

  (merged to 'next' on 2014-08-26 at 1eb7cc3)
 + pretty: make empty userformats truly empty
 + pretty: treat "--format=" as an empty userformat
 + revision: drop useless string offset when parsing "--pretty"

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2014-08-13

 "git log --pretty/format=" with an empty format string did not mean
 the more obvious "No output whatsoever" but "Use default format",
 which was counterintuitive.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2014-08-13

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/stash-list-p (2014-08-07) 1 commit
 - stash: default listing to working-tree diff

 Teach "git stash list -p" to show the difference between the base

 + use a hashmap to make remotes faster

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2014-08-13

 - refs.c: move reflog updates into its own function
 (this branch uses rs/ref-transaction, rs/ref-transaction-1, rs/ref-transaction-reflog and rs/ref-transaction-rename.)

 Follow-up on rs/ref-transaction series to use the packed-ref to
 achieve atomicity when multiple refs are involved.

 No more nitpicks and better design suggestions?

 - refs.c: allow passing raw git_committer_info as email to _update_reflog
 (this branch is used by rs/ref-transaction-multi; uses rs/ref-transaction, rs/ref-transaction-1 and rs/ref-transaction-reflog.)

 Follow-up on rs/ref-transaction series to make renaming a ref
 transactional (i.e. "delete old and create new" should not leave
 an in-between state behind when it fails).

 No more nitpicks and better design suggestions?


* mm/config-edit-global (2014-07-25) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-08-26 at 3a47fc5)
 + commit: advertise config --global --edit on guessed identity
 + home_config_paths(): let the caller ignore xdg path
 + config --global --edit: create a template file if needed

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2014-07-31

 Start "git config --edit --global" from a skeletal per-user
 configuration file contents, instead of a total blank, when the
 user does not already have any.  This immediately reduces the need
 for a later "Have you forgotten setting core.user?" and we can add
 more to the template as we gain more experience.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 Cover updates to reflog with the same transaction mechanism as used
 for reflog manipulations.

 by introducing xgetcwd() helper.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/not-mingw-cygwin (2014-07-21) 2 commits
 - test prerequisites: enumerate with commas
 - test prerequisites: eradicate NOT_FOO

 We have been using NOT_{MINGW,CYGWIN} test prerequisites long
 before Peff invented support for negated prerequisites e.g. !MINGW
 and we still add more uses of the former.  Convert them to the
 latter to avoid confusion.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ta/config-set (2014-07-29) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-08-26 at 81395f9)

 + add `config_set` API for caching config-like files
 (this branch is used by ta/config-set-1 and ta/config-set-2.)

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2014-08-13

 Add in-core caching layer to let us avoid reading the same
 configuration files number of times.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 Test-script clean-up.

 Will hold.


* mt/patch-id-stable (2014-06-10) 1 commit
 - patch-id: change default to stable

 Teaches "git patch-id" to compute the patch ID that does not change
 when the files in a single patch is reordered. As this new algorithm
 is backward incompatible, the last bit to flip it to be the default
 is left out of 'master' for now.

 Will hold.
