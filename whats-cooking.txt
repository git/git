What's cooking in git.git (Jan 2012, #08; Tue, 31)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with '+' are in
'next'.

As promised in the recent couple of issues of "What's cooking", the first
batch of topics that have been cooking in 'next' are now in 'master'. The
tip of 'next' hasn't been rewound yet, but it soon will after the second
batch of topics graduate.

Here are the repositories that have my integration branches:

With maint, master, next, pu, todo:

        git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git
        git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git
        https://code.google.com/p/git-core/
        https://github.com/git/git

With only maint and master:

        git://git.sourceforge.jp/gitroot/git-core/git.git
        git://git-core.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/git-core/git-core

With all the topics and integration branches:

[New Topics]

* fc/zsh-completion (2012-01-30) 4 commits
 - (squash to previous?) completion: remove unused code
 - completion: simplify __git_remotes
 - (squash) completion-style
 - completion: be nicer with zsh

Somehow only 2 out of 4-part series seem to have reached the list, missing
the other 2.

* jc/maint-request-pull-for-tag (2012-01-31) 1 commit
 - request-pull: explicitly ask tags/$name to be pulled

Usability improvement.
Will merge to 'next'.

[Graduated to "master"]

* ar/i18n-no-gettext (2012-01-27) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-01-27 at 0ecf258)
 + i18n: Do not force USE_GETTEXT_SCHEME=fallthrough on NO_GETTEXT
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-01-23 at 694a94e)
 + i18n: Make NO_GETTEXT imply fallthrough scheme in shell l10n
 + add a Makefile switch to avoid gettext translation in shell scripts
 + git-sh-i18n: restructure the logic to compute gettext.sh scheme

* da/maint-mergetool-twoway (2012-01-23) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-01-23 at f927323)
 + mergetool: Provide an empty file when needed

Caters to GUI merge backends that cannot merge two files without
a base by giving them an empty file as a "pretend" common ancestor.

* jc/advise-i18n (2011-12-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-01-23 at 6447013)
 + i18n of multi-line advice messages

Allow localization of advice messages that tend to be longer and
multi-line formatted. For now this is deliberately limited to advise()
interface and not vreportf() in general as touching the latter has
interactions with error() that has plumbing callers whose prefix "error: "
should never be translated.

* jl/submodule-re-add (2012-01-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-01-26 at 482553e)
 + submodule add: fix breakage when re-adding a deep submodule

"git submodule add" forgot to recompute the name to be stored in .gitmodules
when the module was once added to the superproject and already initialized.

* ks/sort-wildcard-in-makefile (2012-01-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-01-23 at e2e0c1d)
 + t/Makefile: Use $(sort ...) explicitly where needed

t/Makefile is adjusted to prevent newer versions of GNU make from running
tests in seemingly random order.

* ld/git-p4-branches-and-labels (2012-01-20) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-01-23 at 9020ec4)
 + git-p4: label import fails with multiple labels at the same changelist
 + git-p4: add test for p4 labels
 + git-p4: importing labels should cope with missing owner
 + git-p4: cope with labels with empty descriptions
 + git-p4: handle p4 branches and labels containing shell chars
 (this branch is used by va/git-p4-branch.)

* nd/clone-detached (2012-01-24) 12 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-01-26 at 7b0cc8a)
 + clone: fix up delay cloning conditions
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-01-23 at bee31c6)
 + push: do not let configured foreign-vcs permanently clobbered
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-01-23 at 9cab64e)
 + clone: print advice on checking out detached HEAD
 + clone: allow --branch to take a tag
 + clone: refuse to clone if --branch points to bogus ref
 + clone: --branch=<branch> always means refs/heads/<branch>
 + clone: delay cloning until after remote HEAD checking
 + clone: factor out remote ref writing
 + clone: factor out HEAD update code
 + clone: factor out checkout code
 + clone: write detached HEAD in bare repositories
 + t5601: add missing && cascade

"git clone" learned to detach the HEAD in the resulting repository when
the source repository's HEAD does not point to a branch.

* rr/sequencer (2012-01-11) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-01-23 at f349b56)
 + sequencer: factor code out of revert builtin
 + revert: prepare to move replay_action to header

Moving large chunk of code out of cherry-pick/revert for later reuse,
primarily to prepare for the next cycle.

* tr/grep-l-with-decoration (2012-01-23) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-01-23 at 42b8795)
 + grep: fix -l/-L interaction with decoration lines

Using "git grep -l/-L" together with options -W or --break may not make
much sense as the output is to only count the number of hits and there is
no place for file breaks, but the latter options made "-l/-L" to miscount
the hits.

* va/git-p4-branch (2012-01-26) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-01-26 at e67c52a)
 + t9801: do not overuse test_must_fail
 + git-p4: Change p4 command invocation
 + git-p4: Add test case for complex branch import
 + git-p4: Search for parent commit on branch creation
 (this branch uses ld/git-p4-branches-and-labels.)

[Stalled]

* jc/advise-push-default (2011-12-18) 1 commit
 - push: hint to use push.default=upstream when appropriate

Peff had a good suggestion outlining an updated code structure so that
somebody new can try to dip his or her toes in the development. Any
takers?

Waiting for a reroll.

* ss/git-svn-prompt-sans-terminal (2012-01-04) 3 commits
 - fixup! 15eaaf4
 - git-svn, perl/Git.pm: extend Git::prompt helper for querying users
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-01-05 at 954f125)
 + perl/Git.pm: "prompt" helper to honor GIT_ASKPASS and SSH_ASKPASS

The bottom one has been replaced with a rewrite based on comments from
Ævar. The second one needs more work, both in perl/Git.pm and prompt.c, to
give precedence to tty over SSH_ASKPASS when terminal is available.

Will defer till the next cycle.

* nd/commit-ignore-i-t-a (2012-01-16) 2 commits
 - commit, write-tree: allow to ignore CE_INTENT_TO_ADD while writing trees
 - cache-tree: update API to take abitrary flags

May want to consider this as fixing an earlier UI mistake, and not as a
feature that devides the userbase.

Will defer till the next cycle.

 - gitweb: show active project_filter in project_list page header
 - gitweb: limit links to alternate forms of project_list to active project_filter

incremental imports.

Will merge to 'master' in the second batch.

* jc/split-blob (2012-01-24) 6 commits
 - chunked-object: streaming checkout
 - chunked-object: fallback checkout codepaths
 - bulk-checkin: support chunked-object encoding
 - bulk-checkin: allow the same data to be multiply hashed
 - new representation types in the packstream
 - varint-in-pack: refactor varint encoding/decoding

Not ready.

I finished the streaming checkout codepath, but as explained in 127b177
(bulk-checkin: support chunked-object encoding, 2011-11-30), these are
still early steps of a long and painful journey. At least pack-objects and
fsck need to learn the new encoding for the series to be usable locally,
and then index-pack/unpack-objects needs to learn it to be used remotely.

Given that I heard a lot of noise that people want large files, and that I
was asked by somebody at GitTogether'11 privately for an advice on how to
pay developers (not me) to help adding necessary support, I am somewhat
dissapointed that the original patch series that was sent almost two
months ago still remains here without much comments and updates from the
developer community. I even made the interface to the logic that decides
where to split chunks easily replaceable, and I deliberately made the
logic in the original patch extremely stupid to entice others, especially
the "bup" fanboys, to come up with a better logic, thinking that giving
people an easy target to shoot for, they may be encouraged to help
out. The plan is not working :-(.

* jc/pull-signed-tag (2012-01-23) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-01-23 at 4257553)
 + merge: use editor by default in interactive sessions

"git merge" in an interactive session learned to spawn the editor by
default to let the user edit the auto-generated merge message, to
encourage people to explain their merges better. Legacy scripts can
export MERGE_AUTOEDIT=no to retain the historical behaviour.

Will merge to 'master' in the second batch and deal with any fallout in
'master'.
