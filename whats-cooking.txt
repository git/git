[Stalled]

* jn/gitweb-js (2011-04-28) 13 commits
 - gitweb: Make JavaScript ability to adjust timezones configurable
 - gitweb.js: Add UI for selecting common timezone to display dates
 - gitweb: JavaScript ability to adjust time based on timezone
 - gitweb: Unify the way long timestamp is displayed

 - gitweb: Split JavaScript for maintability, combining on build
 - Remove gitweb/gitweb.cgi and other legacy targets from main Makefile
 - git-instaweb: Simplify build dependency on gitweb

Rerolled.  Waiting for comments.

* jk/maint-merge-rename-create (2011-03-25) 3 commits
 - merge: turn on rewrite detection
 - merge: handle renames with replacement content
 - t3030: fix accidental success in symlink rename

Peff wanted to reroll this, so this is taken out of "next".

* dm/http-cleanup (2011-03-30) 2 commits
 - http-push: refactor curl_easy_setup madness
 - http: make curl callbacks match contracts from curl header

The second one will probably need re-rolling on top of
sp/maint-clear-postfields after it settles.

* rr/rerere-clear-libify (2011-04-13) 1 commit
 - rerere: Expose an API corresponding to 'clear' functionality

Jonathan had good comments on moving the garbage collection interface as
well. Perhaps needs a re-roll.

* jc/index-pack (2011-02-25) 5 commits
 - index-pack --verify: read anomalous offsets from v2 idx file
 - write_idx_file: need_large_offset() helper function
 - index-pack: --verify
 - write_idx_file: introduce a struct to hold idx customization options
 - index-pack: group the delta-base array entries also by type

Still a WIP. Need to put histogram output into index-pack --verify to
really kill verify-pack.

* jk/tag-contains (2010-07-05) 4 commits
 - Why is "git tag --contains" so slow?
 - default core.clockskew variable to one day
 - limit "contains" traversals based on commit timestamp
 - tag: speed up --contains calculation

The idea of the bottom one is probably Ok, except that the use of object
flags needs to be rethought, or at least the helper needs to be moved to
builtin/tag.c to make it clear that it should not be used outside the
current usage context.

--------------------------------------------------
