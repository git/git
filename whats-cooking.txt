What's cooking in git.git (Jul 2017, #03; Mon, 10)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

We also have tons of small updates in preparation for 2.13.3 on
'maint'.  All of them are topics that have been merged to 'master'
more than a few days ago, but I do not know how well they are tested
in the field by people using 'master' in their everyday workflow.
Ideally, our release process wants to see more people using 'next'
in their everyday workflow to keep 'master' more stable than any
tagged release, but I do not have a good idea on how to encourage
it more than we currently do.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

[Graduated to "master"]

* ab/sha1dc (2017-07-03) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-06 at 5a783032b7)
 + sha1collisiondetection: automatically enable when submodule is populated
 + sha1dc: optionally use sha1collisiondetection as a submodule

 The "collission-detecting" implementation of SHA-1 hash we borrowed
 from is replaced by directly binding the upstream project as our
 submodule.  Glitches on minority platforms are still being worked out.


* ab/wildmatch (2017-06-23) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-07 at 34482a9a4f)
 + wildmatch: remove unused wildopts parameter

 Minor code cleanup.


* bb/unicode-10.0 (2017-07-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-07 at a9c46e097b)
 + unicode: update the width tables to Unicode 10

 Update the character width tables.


* jk/reflog-walk-maint (2017-07-07) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-07 at 611554ba2f)
 + reflog-walk: include all fields when freeing complete_reflogs
 + reflog-walk: don't free reflogs added to cache
 + reflog-walk: duplicate strings in complete_reflogs list
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-06 at 7408dd80a1)
 + reflog-walk: skip over double-null oid due to HEAD rename
 (this branch is used by jk/reflog-walk.)

 After "git branch --move" of the currently checked out branch, the
 code to walk the reflog of HEAD via "log -g" and friends
 incorrectly stopped at the reflog entry that records the renaming
 of the branch.


* ks/commit-assuming-only-warning-removal (2017-06-30) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-05 at 462a72df95)
 + commit-template: distinguish status information unconditionally
 + commit-template: remove outdated notice about explicit paths

 An old message shown in the commit log template was removed, as it
 has outlived its usefulness.


* ks/typofix-commit-c-comment (2017-07-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-07 at 64e98fc832)
 + builtin/commit.c: fix a typo in the comment

 Typofix.


* pw/unquote-path-in-git-pm (2017-06-30) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-05 at 538ab4d599)
 + t9700: add tests for Git::unquote_path()
 + Git::unquote_path(): throw an exception on bad path
 + Git::unquote_path(): handle '\a'
 + add -i: move unquote_path() to Git.pm

 Code refactoring.

  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-06 at 9c9e1d59a2)
 + coccinelle: polish FREE_AND_NULL rules

 Code cleanup.

[New Topics]

* kn/ref-filter-branch-list (2017-07-10) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-10 at 35fd25c0dd)
 + ref-filter.c: drop return from void function
 + branch: set remote color in ref-filter branch immediately
 + branch: use BRANCH_COLOR_LOCAL in ref-filter format
 + branch: only perform HEAD check for local branches

 The rewrite of "git branch --list" using for-each-ref's internals
 that happened in v2.13 regressed its handling of color.branch.local;
 this has been fixed.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* rs/apply-avoid-over-reading (2017-07-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-10 at 2d8191ec3f)
 + apply: use strcmp(3) for comparing strings in gitdiff_verify_name()

 Code cleanup.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* rs/progress-overall-throughput-at-the-end (2017-07-09) 1 commit
 - progress: show overall rate in last update

 The progress meter did not give a useful output when we haven't had
 0.5 seconds to measure the throughput during the interval.  Instead
 show the overall throughput rate at the end, which is a much more
 useful number.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* rs/sha1-file-micro-optim (2017-07-09) 2 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - sha1_file: add slash once in for_each_file_in_obj_subdir()

 Code cleanup.

 Perhaps drop.

  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-10 at 2dd3e7cab0)
 + urlmatch: use hex2chr() in append_normalized_escapes()

 Code cleanup.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* rs/use-div-round-up (2017-07-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-10 at accb7919da)
 + use DIV_ROUND_UP

 Code cleanup.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* rs/wt-status-cleanup (2017-07-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-10 at d8939f683a)
 + wt-status: use separate variable for result of shorten_unambiguous_ref

 Code cleanup.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ks/prepare-commit-msg-sample (2017-07-10) 3 commits
 - hook: add sign-off using "interpret-trailers"
 - hook: name the positional variables
 - hook: cleanup script

 Remove an example that is now obsolete from a sample hook,
 and improve an old example in it that added a sign-off manually
 to use the interpret-trailers command.


* jk/build-with-asan (2017-07-10) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-10 at 49757e1119)
 + Makefile: disable unaligned loads with UBSan
 + Makefile: turn off -fomit-frame-pointer with sanitizers
 + Makefile: add helper for compiling with -fsanitize
 + test-lib: turn on ASan abort_on_error by default
 + test-lib: set ASAN_OPTIONS variable before we run git

 The build procedure has been improved to allow building and testing
 Git with address sanitizer more easily.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ks/fix-rebase-doc-picture (2017-07-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-10 at 3acb856b17)

[Stalled]

* mg/status-in-progress-info (2017-05-10) 2 commits
 - status --short --inprogress: spell it as --in-progress
 - status: show in-progress info for short status

 "git status" learns an option to report various operations
 (e.g. "merging") that the user is in the middle of.

 - worktree move: refuse to move worktrees with submodules
 - worktree move: accept destination as directory

* sg/clone-refspec-from-command-line-config (2017-06-16) 2 commits
 - Documentation/clone: document ignored configuration variables
 - clone: respect additional configured fetch refspecs during initial fetch
 (this branch is used by sg/remote-no-string-refspecs.)

 "git clone -c var=val" is a way to set configuration variables in
 the resulting repository, but it is more useful to also make these
 variables take effect while the initial clone is happening,
 e.g. these configuration variables could be fetch refspecs.

 Waiting for a response.

 - rebase -i: rearrange fixup/squash lines using the rebase--helper
 - t3415: test fixup with wrapped oneline
 - rebase -i: skip unnecessary picks using the rebase--helper

[Cooking]

* jc/allow-lazy-cas (2017-07-06) 1 commit
 - push: disable lazy --force-with-lease by default

 Because "git push --force-with-lease[=<ref>]" that relies on the
 stability of remote-tracking branches is unsafe when something
 fetches into the repository behind user's back, it is now disabled
 by default.  A new configuration variable can be used to enable it
 by users who know what they are doing.  This would pave the way to
 possibly turn `--force` into `--force-with-lease`.

 Will wait for feedback, then merge to and cook in 'next'.


* bc/object-id (2017-07-04) 12 commits
 - sha1_name: convert GET_SHA1* flags to GET_OID*
 - sha1_name: convert get_sha1* to get_oid*
 - Convert remaining callers of get_sha1 to get_oid.
 - builtin/verify-tag: convert to struct object_id
 - builtin/unpack-file: convert to struct object_id
 - bisect: convert bisect_checkout to struct object_id
 - builtin/update_ref: convert to struct object_id
 - sequencer: convert to struct object_id
 - remote: convert struct push_cas to struct object_id
 - submodule: convert submodule config lookup to use object_id
 - builtin/merge-tree: convert remaining caller of get_sha1 to object_id
 - builtin/fsck: convert remaining caller of get_sha1 to object_id

 Conversion from uchar[20] to struct object_id continues.

 Expecting a reroll.

* jk/reflog-walk (2017-07-09) 9 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-09 at 7449e964c6)
 + reflog-walk: apply --since/--until to reflog dates
 + reflog-walk: stop using fake parents
 + rev-list: check reflog_info before showing usage
 + get_revision_1(): replace do-while with an early return
 + log: do not free parents when walking reflog
 + log: clarify comment about reflog cycles
 + revision: disallow reflog walking with revs->limited
 + t1414: document some reflog-walk oddities
 + Merge branch 'jk/reflog-walk-maint' into jk/reflog-walk

 Numerous bugs in walking of reflogs via "log -g" and friends have
 been fixed.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* sb/hashmap-cleanup (2017-07-05) 10 commits
 - t/helper/test-hashmap: use custom data instead of duplicate cmp functions
 - name-hash.c: drop hashmap_cmp_fn cast
 - submodule-config.c: drop hashmap_cmp_fn cast
 - remote.c: drop hashmap_cmp_fn cast
 - patch-ids.c: drop hashmap_cmp_fn cast
 - convert/sub-process: drop cast to hashmap_cmp_fn
 - config.c: drop hashmap_cmp_fn cast
 - builtin/describe: drop hashmap_cmp_fn cast
 - builtin/difftool.c: drop hashmap_cmp_fn cast
 - attr.c: drop hashmap_cmp_fn cast
 (this branch uses sb/hashmap-customize-comparison; is tangled with sb/diff-color-move.)

 Many uses of comparision callback function the hashmap API uses
 cast the callback function type when registering it to
 hashmap_init(), which defeats the compile time type checking when
 the callback interface changes (e.g. gaining more parameters).
 The callback implementations have been updated to take "void *"
 pointers and cast them to the type they expect instead.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* tb/push-to-cygwin-unc-path (2017-07-05) 1 commit
 - cygwin: allow pushing to UNC paths

 On Cygwin, similar to Windows, "git push //server/share/repository"
 ought to mean a repository on a network share that can be accessed
 locally, but this did not work correctly due to stripping the double
 slashes at the beginning.

 This may need to be heavily tested before it gets unleashed to the
 wild, as the change is at a fairly low-level code and would affect
 not just the code to decide if the push destination is local.  There
 may be unexpected fallouts in the path normalization.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ab/grep-lose-opt-regflags (2017-06-30) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-05 at 375c0b92ea)
 + grep: remove redundant REG_NEWLINE when compiling fixed regex
 + grep: remove regflags from the public grep_opt API
 + grep: remove redundant and verbose re-assignments to 0
 + grep: remove redundant "fixed" field re-assignment to 0
 + grep: adjust a redundant grep pattern type assignment
 + grep: remove redundant double assignment to 0

 Code cleanup.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* sb/hashmap-customize-comparison (2017-06-30) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-06 at cc420805f3)
 + hashmap: migrate documentation from Documentation/technical into header
 + patch-ids.c: use hashmap correctly
 + hashmap.h: compare function has access to a data field
 (this branch is used by sb/diff-color-move and sb/hashmap-cleanup.)

 Update the hashmap API so that data to customize the behaviour of
 the comparison function can be specified at the time a hashmap is
 initialized.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* mt/p4-parse-G-output (2017-07-05) 1 commit
 . git-p4: parse marshal output "p4 -G" in p4 changes

 Use "p4 -G" to make "p4 changes" output more Python-friendly
 to parse.

 Needs review/ack from git-p4 folks.
 It still seems to break when merged to 'pu'.


* ex/deprecate-empty-pathspec-as-match-all (2017-06-23) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-06-26 at d026281517)
 + pathspec: die on empty strings as pathspec
 + t0027: do not use an empty string as a pathspec element

 The final step to make an empty string as a pathspec element
 illegal.  We started this by first deprecating and warning a
 pathspec that has such an element in 2.11 (Nov 2016).

 Hopefully we can merge this down to the 'master' by the end of the
 year?  A deprecation warning period that is about 1 year does not
 sound too bad.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* sb/pull-rebase-submodule (2017-06-27) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-09 at 48d2c3a51c)
 + builtin/fetch cleanup: always set default value for submodule recursing
 + pull: optionally rebase submodules (remote submodule changes only)
 + builtin/fetch: parse recurse-submodules-default at default options parsing
 + builtin/fetch: factor submodule recurse parsing out to submodule config

 "git pull --rebase --recurse-submodules" learns to rebase the
 branch in the submodules to an updated base.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* mh/packed-ref-store (2017-07-03) 30 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-05 at 6c68c603cc)
 + read_packed_refs(): die if `packed-refs` contains bogus data
 + t3210: add some tests of bogus packed-refs file contents
 + repack_without_refs(): don't lock or unlock the packed refs
 + commit_packed_refs(): remove call to `packed_refs_unlock()`
 + clear_packed_ref_cache(): don't protest if the lock is held
 + packed_refs_unlock(), packed_refs_is_locked(): new functions
 + packed_refs_lock(): report errors via a `struct strbuf *err`
 + packed_refs_lock(): function renamed from lock_packed_refs()
 + commit_packed_refs(): use a staging file separate from the lockfile
 + commit_packed_refs(): report errors rather than dying
 + packed_ref_store: make class into a subclass of `ref_store`
 + packed-backend: new module for handling packed references
 + packed_read_raw_ref(): new function, replacing `resolve_packed_ref()`
 + packed_ref_store: support iteration
 + packed_peel_ref(): new function, extracted from `files_peel_ref()`
 + repack_without_refs(): take a `packed_ref_store *` parameter
 + get_packed_ref(): take a `packed_ref_store *` parameter
 + rollback_packed_refs(): take a `packed_ref_store *` parameter

 + get_packed_refs(): take a `packed_ref_store *` parameter
 + get_packed_ref_cache(): take a `packed_ref_store *` parameter
 + validate_packed_ref_cache(): take a `packed_ref_store *` parameter
 + clear_packed_ref_cache(): take a `packed_ref_store *` parameter
 + packed_ref_store: move `packed_refs_lock` member here
 + packed_ref_store: move `packed_refs_path` here
 + packed_ref_store: new struct
 + add_packed_ref(): teach function to overwrite existing refs
 + t1408: add a test of stale packed refs covered by loose refs

 The "ref-store" code reorganization continues.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* sb/submodule-doc (2017-06-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-09 at fda0ceec31)
 + submodules: overhaul documentation

 Doc update.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* sd/branch-copy (2017-06-18) 3 commits
 - branch: add a --copy (-c) option to go with --move (-m)
 - branch: add test for -m renaming multiple config sections
 - config: create a function to format section headers

 "git branch" learned "-c/-C" to create and switch to a new branch
 by copying an existing one.

 Undecided.

 I personally do not think "branch --copy master backup" while on
 "master" that switches to "backup" is a good UI, and I *will* say
 "I told you so" when users complain after we merge this down to
 'next' and eventually to 'master'.


* ls/filter-process-delayed (2017-06-30) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-07-05 at a35e644082)
 + convert: add "status=delayed" to filter process protocol
 + convert: refactor capabilities negotiation
 + convert: move multiple file filter error handling to separate function
 + convert: put the flags field before the flag itself for consistent style
 + t0021: write "OUT <size>" only on success
 + t0021: make debug log file name configurable
 + t0021: keep filter log files on comparison

 The filter-process interface learned to allow a process with long
 latency give a "delayed" response.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* bp/fsmonitor (2017-06-12) 6 commits
 - fsmonitor: add a sample query-fsmonitor hook script for Watchman
 - fsmonitor: add documentation for the fsmonitor extension.
 - fsmonitor: add test cases for fsmonitor extension
 - fsmonitor: teach git to optionally utilize a file system monitor to speed up detecting new or changed files.
 - dir: make lookup_untracked() available outside of dir.c
 - bswap: add 64 bit endianness helper get_be64

 We learned to talk to watchman to speed up "git status".

 Expecting a reroll.

 + diff.c: move line ending check into emit_hunk_header
 + diff.c: readability fix
 + Merge branch 'sb/hashmap-customize-comparison' into sb/diff-color-move
 (this branch uses sb/hashmap-customize-comparison; is tangled with sb/hashmap-cleanup.)

 "git diff" has been taught to optionally paint new lines that are
 the same as deleted lines elsewhere differently from genuinely new
 lines.

 "git gc" and friends when multiple worktrees are used off of a
 single repository did not consider the index and per-worktree refs
 of other worktrees as the root for reachability traversal, making
 objects that are in use only in other worktrees to be subject to
 garbage collection.
