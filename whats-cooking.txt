What's cooking in git.git (Mar 2018, #03; Wed, 14)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

[Graduated to "master"]

* ab/gc-auto-in-commit (2018-03-01) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-02 at 96a5a4d629)
 + commit: run git gc --auto just before the post-commit hook

 "git commit" used to run "gc --auto" near the end, which was lost
 when the command was reimplemented in C by mistake.


* ab/pre-auto-gc-battery (2018-02-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-06 at ca9cb273cb)
 + hooks/pre-auto-gc-battery: allow gc to run on non-laptops

 A sample auto-gc hook (in contrib/) to skip auto-gc while on
 battery has been updated to almost always allow running auto-gc
 unless on_ac_power command is absolutely sure that we are on
 battery power (earlier, it skipped unless the command is sure that
 we are on ac power).


* ag/userdiff-go-funcname (2018-03-01) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-02 at ea404d1be9)
 + userdiff: add built-in pattern for golang

 "git diff" and friends learned funcname patterns for Go language
 source files.


* bp/untracked-cache-noflush (2018-02-28) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-02 at 709887971b)
 + untracked cache: use git_env_bool() not getenv() for customization
 + dir.c: don't flag the index as dirty for changes to the untracked cache

 Writing out the index file when the only thing that changed in it
 is the untracked cache information is often wasteful, and this has
 been optimized out.


* ds/find-unique-abbrev-optim (2018-02-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-02 at 0b6d4f9335)
 + sha1_name: fix uninitialized memory errors

 While finding unique object name abbreviation, the code may
 accidentally have read beyond the end of the array of object names
 in a pack.


* ds/mark-parents-uninteresting-optim (2018-02-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-02 at 5a42c79806)
 + revision.c: reduce object database queries

 Micro optimization in revision traversal code.


* jc/test-must-be-empty (2018-02-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-02 at ec129f1b97)
 + test_must_be_empty: make sure the file exists, not just empty

 Test framework tweak to catch developer thinko.


* jh/status-no-ahead-behind (2018-01-24) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-02 at 68bde8d571)
 + status: support --no-ahead-behind in long format
 + status: update short status to respect --no-ahead-behind
 + status: add --[no-]ahead-behind to status and commit for V2 format.
 + stat_tracking_info: return +1 when branches not equal

 "git status" can spend a lot of cycles to compute the relation
 between the current branch and its upstream, which can now be
 disabled with "--no-ahead-behind" option.


* jk/add-i-diff-filter (2018-03-05) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-08 at 6ef737add3)
 + add--interactive: detect bogus diffFilter output
 + t3701: add a test for interactive.diffFilter

 The "interactive.diffFilter" used by "git add -i" must retain
 one-to-one correspondence between its input and output, but it was
 not enforced and caused end-user confusion.  We now at least make
 sure the filtered result has the same number of lines as its input
 to detect a broken filter.


* jk/smart-http-protocol-doc-fix (2018-03-05) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-08 at 599b1a7c42)
 + smart-http: document flush after "# service" line

 A doc update.


* ma/roll-back-lockfiles (2018-02-28) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-06 at be29bf891c)
 + sequencer: do not roll back lockfile unnecessarily
 + merge: always roll back lock in `checkout_fast_forward()`
 + merge-recursive: always roll back lock in `merge_recursive_generic()`
 + sequencer: always roll back lock in `do_recursive_merge()`
 + sequencer: make lockfiles non-static
 (this branch is used by ma/skip-writing-unchanged-index.)

 Some codepaths used to take a lockfile and did not roll it back;
 they are automatically rolled back at program exit, so there is no
 real "breakage", but it still is a good practice to roll back when
 you are done with a lockfile.


* mk/doc-pretty-fill (2018-02-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-02 at 623461b127)
 + docs/pretty-formats: fix typo '% <(<N>)' -> '%<|(<N>)'

 Docfix.


* nd/diff-stat-with-summary (2018-02-27) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-06 at d543f92f5e)
 + diff: add --compact-summary
 + diff.c: refactor pprint_rename() to use strbuf

 "git diff" and friends learned "--compact-summary" that shows the
 information usually given with the "--summary" option on the same
 line as the diffstat output of the "--stat" option (which saves
 vertical space and keeps info on a single path at the same place).


* nd/object-allocation-comments (2018-03-06) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-08 at 91d553a339)
 + object.h: realign object flag allocation comment
 + object.h: update flag allocation comment

 Code doc update.


* nd/parseopt-completion (2018-03-07) 45 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-08 at 2461b7035d)
 + completion: more subcommands in _git_notes()
 + completion: complete --{reuse,reedit}-message= for all notes subcmds
 + completion: simplify _git_notes
 + completion: don't set PARSE_OPT_NOCOMPLETE on --rerere-autoupdate
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-02 at d72a6525fd)

 + git-completion.bash: introduce __gitcomp_builtin
 + parse-options: let OPT__FORCE take optional flags argument
 + parse-options: add OPT_xxx_F() variants
 + parse-options: support --git-completion-helper

 The parse-options API has been taught an option to help the
 completion script; the command line completion has been updated to
 take advantage of this mechanism.


* nd/worktree-move (2018-03-06) 8 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-06 at a26271e7de)
 + t2028: fix minor error and issues in newly-added "worktree move" tests
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-02 at 5c514dfc92)
 + worktree remove: allow it when $GIT_WORK_TREE is already gone
 + worktree remove: new command
 + worktree move: refuse to move worktrees with submodules
 + worktree move: accept destination as directory
 + worktree move: new command
 + worktree.c: add update_worktree_location()
 + worktree.c: add validate_worktree()

 "git worktree" learned move and remove subcommands.


* ot/ref-filter-cleanup (2018-02-21) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-02 at 3b4c39a4b5)
 + ref-filter: get rid of goto
 + ref-filter: get rid of duplicate code

 Code cleanup.


* pw/add-p-recount (2018-03-05) 9 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-06 at 68952f9bb0)
 + add -p: don't rely on apply's '--recount' option
 + add -p: fix counting when splitting and coalescing
 + add -p: calculate offset delta for edited patches
 + add -p: adjust offsets of subsequent hunks when one is skipped
 + t3701: add failing test for pathological context lines
 + t3701: don't hard code sha1 hash values
 + t3701: use test_write_lines and write_script
 + t3701: indent here documents
 + add -i: add function to format hunk header
 (this branch is used by pw/add-p-select.)

 "git add -p" has been lazy in coalescing split patches before
 passing the result to underlying "git apply", leading to corner
 case bugs; the logic to prepare the patch to be applied after hunk
 selections has been tightened.


* rj/test-i18ngrep (2018-02-28) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-06 at 7ea1a2352c)
 + t5536: simplify checking of messages output to stderr
 + t4151: consolidate multiple calls to test_i18ngrep

 Test updates.


* rs/perf-repeat-thrice-by-default (2018-02-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-02 at 4898b3c450)
 + perf: use GIT_PERF_REPEAT_COUNT=3 by default even without config file

 Perf test regression fix.


* rv/grep-cleanup (2018-02-23) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-02 at 4aafca15f9)
 + grep: simplify grep_oid and grep_file
 + grep: move grep_source_init outside critical section

 Threaded "git grep" has been optimized to avoid allocation in code
 section that is covered under a mutex.


* sg/subtree-signed-commits (2018-02-23) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-02 at c5f6fd33e6)
 + subtree: fix add and pull for GPG-signed commits

 "git subtree" script (in contrib/) scripted around "git log", whose
 output got affected by end-user configuration like log.showsignature


* sg/test-x (2018-02-28) 11 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-06 at ab0684b27c)
 + travis-ci: run tests with '-x' tracing
 + t/README: add a note about don't saving stderr of compound commands
 + t1510-repo-setup: mark as untraceable with '-x'
 + t9903-bash-prompt: don't check the stderr of __git_ps1()
 + t5570-git-daemon: don't check the stderr of a subshell
 + t5526: use $TRASH_DIRECTORY to specify the path of GIT_TRACE log file
 + t5500-fetch-pack: don't check the stderr of a subshell
 + t3030-merge-recursive: don't check the stderr of a subshell
 + t1507-rev-parse-upstream: don't check the stderr of a shell function
 + t: add means to disable '-x' tracing for individual test scripts
 + t: prevent '-x' tracing from interfering with test helpers' stderr

 Running test scripts under -x option of the shell is often not a
 useful way to debug them, because the error messages from the
 commands tests try to capture and inspect are contaminated by the
 tracing output by the shell.  An earlier work done to make it more
 pleasant to run tests under -x with recent versions of bash is
 extended to cover posix shells that do not support BASH_XTRACEFD.


* sg/travis-build-during-script-phase (2018-01-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-02 at 29e1585ae7)
 + travis-ci: build Git during the 'script' phase

 Build the executable in 'script' phase in Travis CI integration, to
 follow the established practice, rather than during 'before_script'
 phase.  This allows the CI categorize the failures better ('failed'
 is project's fault, 'errored' is build environment's).

 Update funcname pattern used for C# to recognize "async" keyword.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ti/fetch-everything-local-optim (2018-03-14) 1 commit
 - fetch-pack.c: use oidset to check existence of loose object

 A "git fetch" from a repository with insane number of refs into a
 repository that is already up-to-date still wasted too many cycles
 making many lstat(2) calls to see if these objects at the tips
 exist as loose objects locally.  These lstat(2) calls are optimized
 away by enumerating all loose objects beforehand.

 It is unknown if the new strategy negatively affects existing use
 cases, fetching into a repository with many loose objects from a
 repository with small number of refs.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ab/nuke-emacs-contrib (2018-03-13) 1 commit
 - git{,-blame}.el: remove old bitrotting Emacs code

 - shortlog: do not accept revisions when run outside repo
 - shortlog: add usage-string for stdin-reading
 - git-shortlog.txt: reorder usages

 "git shortlog cruft" aborted with a BUG message when run outside a
 Git repository.  The command has been taught to complain about
 extra and unwanted arguments on its command line instead in such a
 case.

 - configure: fix a regression in PCRE v1 detection

 Git can be built to use either v1 or v2 of the PCRE library, and so
 far, the build-time configuration USE_LIBPCRE=YesPlease instructed
 the build procedure to use v1, but now it means v2.  USE_LIBPCRE1
 and USE_LIBPCRE2 can be used to explicitly choose which version to
 use, as before.

 . exec_cmd: RUNTIME_PREFIX on some POSIX systems
 . Makefile: add Perl runtime prefix support
 . Makefile: add support for "perllibdir"
 . Makefile: generate Perl header from template file

 A build-time option has been added to allow Git to be told to refer

 way that has been possible on Windows for quite some time, for
 Linux, BSDs and Darwin.

 Perhaps it is about time to reboot the effort?

 - t5560-http-backend-noserver.sh: add CONTENT_LENGTH cases
 - SQUASH???
 - http-backend: respect CONTENT_LENGTH as specified by rfc3875

 The http-backend (used for smart-http transport) used to slurp the
 whole input until EOF, without paying attention to CONTENT_LENGTH
 that is supplied in the environment and instead expecting the Web
 server to close the input stream.  This has been fixed.

 Expecting a reroll.
 Suggested fixes to be used when rerolling is queued, but I'd
 prefer _not_ squashing them myself.

 Also, it may be too complex solution for the problem.

* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2017-08-10) 1 commit
 . zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

 Needs resurrecting by making sure the fix is good and still applies
 (or adjusted to today's codebase).

* bb/git-gui-ssh-key-files (2018-03-02) 2 commits
 - Merge branch 'bb/ssh-key-files' of git-gui into bb/git-gui-ssh-key-files
 - git-gui: search for all current SSH key types

 "git gui" learned that "~/.ssh/id_ecdsa.pub" and
 "~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub" are also possible SSH key files.


* bp/git-gui-bind-kp-enter (2018-03-02) 2 commits
 - Merge branch 'bp/bind-kp-enter' of git-gui into bp/git-gui-bind-kp-enter
 - git-gui: bind CTRL/CMD+numpad ENTER to do_commit

 "git gui" performs commit upon CTRL/CMD+ENTER but the
 CTRL/CMD+KP_ENTER (i.e. enter key on the numpad) did not have the
 same key binding.  It now does.


* cb/git-gui-ttk-style (2018-03-05) 2 commits
 - Merge branch 'cb/ttk-style' of git-gui into cb/git-gui-ttk-style
 - git-gui: workaround ttk:style theme use

 "git gui" has been taught to work with old versions of tk (like
 8.5.7) that do not support "ttk::style theme use" as a way to query
 the current theme.


* nd/pack-objects-pack-struct (2018-03-05) 9 commits
 - pack-objects: reorder 'hash' to pack struct object_entry
 - pack-objects: refer to delta objects by index instead of pointer
 - pack-objects: move in_pack out of struct object_entry
 - pack-objects: move in_pack_pos out of struct object_entry
 - pack-objects: note about in_pack_header_size
 - pack-objects: use bitfield for object_entry::depth
 - pack-objects: use bitfield for object_entry::dfs_state
 - pack-objects: turn type and in_pack_type to bitfields
 - pack-objects: document holes in struct object_entry.h

 "git pack-objects" needs to allocate tons of "struct object_entry"
 while doing its work, and shrinking its size helps the performance
 quite a bit.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* nd/repack-keep-pack (2018-03-07) 6 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - pack-objects: display progress in get_object_details()
 - pack-objects: show some progress when counting kept objects
 - gc --auto: exclude base pack if not enough mem to "repack -ad"
 - repack: add --keep-pack option
 - t7700: have closing quote of a test at the beginning of line

 "git gc" in a large repository takes a lot of time as it considers
 to repack all objects into one pack by default.  The command has
 been taught to pretend as if the largest existing packfile is
 marked with ".keep" so that it is left untouched while objects in
 other packs and loose ones are repacked.

 Expecting a reroll.

* nd/worktree-prune (2018-03-06) 3 commits
 - worktree prune: improve prune logic when worktree is moved
 - worktree: delete dead code
 - gc.txt: more details about what gc does

 The way "git worktree prune" worked internally has been simplified,
 by assuming how "git worktree move" moves an existing worktree to a
 different place.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* pw/add-p-select (2018-03-06) 3 commits
 - add -p: optimize line selection for short hunks
 - add -p: allow line selection to be inverted
 - add -p: select individual hunk lines

 "git add -p" interactive interface learned to let users choose
 individual added/removed lines to be used in the operation, instead
 of accepting or rejecting a whole hunk.

 Expecting a reroll.

* ld/p4-unshelve (2018-02-22) 1 commit
 - git-p4: add unshelve command

 "git p4" learned to "unshelve" shelved commit from P4.

 Will hold, perhaps drop and use format-change that uses a proper "diff".

 It seems that this topic is getting there.


* ma/config-page-only-in-list-mode (2018-02-21) 3 commits
 - config: change default of `pager.config` to "on"
 - config: respect `pager.config` in list/get-mode only
 - t7006: add tests for how git config paginates

 In a way similar to how "git tag" learned to honor the pager
 setting only in the list mode, "git config" learned to ignore the
 pager setting when it is used for setting values (i.e. when the
 purpose of the operation is not to "show").

 Rename detection logic in "diff" family that is used in "merge" has
 learned to guess when all of x/a, x/b and x/c have moved to z/a,
 z/b and z/c, it is likely that x/d added in the meantime would also
 want to move to z/d by taking the hint that the entire directory
 'x' moved to 'z'.  A bug causing dirty files involved in a rename
 to be overwritten during merge has also been fixed as part of this
 work.

 Will merge to 'master'.

* cc/require-tcl-tk-for-build (2017-11-29) 2 commits
 - travis-ci: avoid new tcl/tk build requirement
 - Makefile: check that tcl/tk is installed

 A first-time builder of Git may have installed neither tclsh nor
 msgfmt, in which case git-gui and gitk part will fail and break the
 build.  As a workaround, refuse to run a build when tclsh is not
 installed and NO_TCLTK is not set.

 Stalled for too long without any response; will discard.
 I still feel that requring tclsh to be installed, with or without
 "escape hatch" for experts, may be too heavy-handed.


* mg/merge-base-fork-point (2017-09-17) 3 commits
 - merge-base: find fork-point outside partial reflog
 - merge-base: return fork-point outside reflog
 - t6010: test actual test output

 "merge-base --fork-point $branch $commit" is used to guess on which
 commit among the commits that were once at the tip of the $branch the
 $commit was built on top of, and it learns these historical tips from
 the reflog of the $branch.  When the true fork-point is lost due to
 pruning of old reflog entries, the command does not give any output,
 because it has no way to guess correctly and does not want to mislead
 the user with a wrong guess.

 The command has been updated to give the best but not known to be
 correct guess, based on a hope that a merge-base between $commit and a
 virtual merge across all the reflog entries that still are available
 for $branch may still be a closer to the true fork-point than the
 merge-base between $commit and the current tip of the $branch.

 This may have to be offered by an additional option, to allow the
 users that are prepared to see a potentially incorrect guess to opt
 into the feature, without affecting the current callers that may not
 be prepared to accept a guess that is not known to be correct.

 Stalled for too long without any response; will discard.


* mg/status-in-progress-info (2017-05-10) 2 commits
 - status --short --inprogress: spell it as --in-progress
 - status: show in-progress info for short status

 "git status" learns an option to report various operations
 (e.g. "merging") that the user is in the middle of.

 - init-db: change --template type to OPTION_FILENAME
 - parse-options: expand $HOME on filename options

 "git cmd --opt=~u/path/to/file" did not tilde-expand "~u" part to
 the path to the home directory of user 'u'

 This may make the resulting whole more confusing, though.

* dp/git-el-ls-files-excludes (2018-03-05) 1 commit
 . git.el: handle default excludesfile properly

 The "git.el" script (in contrib/) has been taught to use
 "--exclude-standard" option when driving "ls-files", instead of
 locating the exclude files on its own.  With this change, it now
 honors $XDG_CONFIG_HOME when it is set.

 The author of "git.el" recommends that users consider switching to
 "magit", though.

 Discarded, as contrib/emacs/ hierarchy is being emptied by the
 ab/nuke-emacs-contrib topic.
