What's cooking in git.git (Feb 2015, #06; Sun, 22)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.

The 'master' front have merged many topics that can further merged
to the maintainance tracks.  We may want to do a v2.3.1 soonish.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* ab/merge-file-prefix (2015-02-11) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-02-16 at 89e0252)
 + merge-file: correctly open files when in a subdir

 "git merge-file" did not work correctly in a subdirectory.

  (merged to 'next' on 2015-02-16 at f76ff44)
 + builtin/blame: destroy initialized commit_info only

 "git blame" died, trying to free an uninitialized piece of memory.


* es/squelch-openssl-warnings-on-macosx (2015-02-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-02-16 at bbe2880)
 + git-compat-util: do not step on MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED

 An earlier workaround to squelch unhelpful deprecation warnings
 from the complier on Mac OSX unnecessarily set minimum required
 version of the OS, which the user might want to raise (or lower)
 for other reasons.


* jc/conf-var-doc (2015-02-02) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-02-16 at 97512a3)
 + CodingGuidelines: describe naming rules for configuration variables
 + config.txt: mark deprecated variables more prominently
 + config.txt: clarify that add.ignore-errors is deprecated

 Longstanding configuration variable naming rules has been added to
 the documentation.


* jc/diff-files-ita (2015-02-04) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-02-16 at d7867a3)

 Code cleanup.


* jk/prune-mtime (2015-02-09) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-02-16 at 3d46eae)
 + sha1_file: fix iterating loose alternate objects
 + for_each_loose_file_in_objdir: take an optional strbuf path

 In v2.2.0, we broke "git prune" that runs in a repository that
 borrows from an alternate object store.

  (merged to 'next' on 2015-02-16 at 8253132)
 + git-submodule.sh: fix '/././' path normalization

 "git submodule add" failed to squash "path/to/././submodule" to
 "path/to/submodule".

  (merged to 'next' on 2015-02-16 at 2c10cc1)
 + check-builtins: strip executable suffix $X when enumerating builtins

  (merged to 'next' on 2015-02-16 at de90f95)
 + Makefile: handle broken curl version number in version check

 Certain older vintages of cURL give irregular output from
 "curl-config --vernum", which confused our build system.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* mm/am-c-doc (2015-02-20) 2 commits
 - Documentation/git-am.txt: mention mailinfo.scissors config variable
 - Documentation/config.txt: document mailinfo.scissors

 The configuration variable 'mailinfo.scissors' was hard to
 discover in the documentation.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 - sha1_name: use strlcpy() to copy strings
 - pretty: use starts_with() to check for a prefix

 No comments?  No reviews?  No interests?

 - git-status.txt: advertisement for untracked cache
 - untracked cache: guard and disable on system changes

* ak/stash-store-create-help (2015-01-13) 1 commit
 - stash: show "create" and "store" subcommands in usage-help

 Will discard.


* bp/diff-relative-config (2015-01-07) 2 commits
 - diff: teach diff.relative to give default to --relative=<value>
 - diff: teach --no-relative to override earlier --relative

 No comments?  No interests?


* jc/diff-b-m (2015-02-17) 4 commits
 - WIP: diff-b-m
 - diffcore-rename: allow easier debugging
 - diffcore-rename.c: add locate_rename_src()
 - diffcore-break: allow debugging
 (this branch uses jc/diff-test-updates.)

 "git diff -B -M" produced incorrect patch when the postimage of a
 completely rewritten file is similar to the preimage of a removed
 file; such a resulting file must not be expressed as a rename from
 other place.

 The fix in this patch is broken, unfortunately.


* nd/slim-index-pack-memory-usage (2015-02-10) 3 commits
 - index-pack: kill union delta_base to save memory
 - FIXUP
 - index-pack: reduce memory footprint a bit

 Need to replace with the reroll ($gmane/264126).


* pw/remote-set-url-fetch (2014-11-26) 1 commit
 - remote: add --fetch and --both options to set-url

 Expecting a reroll.


* je/quiltimport-no-fuzz (2014-10-21) 2 commits
 - git-quiltimport: flip the default not to allow fuzz
 - git-quiltimport.sh: allow declining fuzz with --exact option

 "quiltimport" drove "git apply" always with -C1 option to reduce
 context of the patch in order to give more chance to somewhat stale
 patches to apply.  Add an "--exact" option to disable, and also
 "-C$n" option to customize this behaviour.  The top patch
 optionally flips the default to "--exact".

 Tired of waiting for an Ack
 Will discard.


* tr/remerge-diff (2014-11-10) 9 commits
 - t4213: avoid "|" in sed regexp
 - log --remerge-diff: show what the conflict resolution changed
 - name-hash: allow dir hashing even when !ignore_case
 - merge-recursive: allow storing conflict hunks in index
 - merge_diff_mode: fold all merge diff variants into an enum
 - combine-diff: do not pass revs->dense_combined_merges redundantly
 - merge-recursive: -Xindex-only to leave worktree unchanged
 - merge-recursive: internal flag to avoid touching the worktree
 - merge-recursive: remove dead conditional in update_stages()

 "log -p" output learns a new way to let users inspect a merge
 commit by showing the differences between the automerged result
 with conflicts the person who recorded the merge would have seen
 and the final conflict resolution that was recorded in the merge.

 Waiting for a reroll ($gmane/256591).


* hv/submodule-config (2014-11-11) 4 commits
 - do not die on error of parsing fetchrecursesubmodules option
 - use new config API for worktree configurations of submodules
 - extract functions for submodule config set and lookup
 - implement submodule config cache for lookup of submodule names

 Kicked back to 'pu' per request ($gmane/255610).


* ab/add-interactive-show-diff-func-name (2014-05-12) 2 commits
 - SQUASH??? git-add--interactive: Preserve diff heading when splitting hunks
 - git-add--interactive: Preserve diff heading when splitting hunks

 Waiting for a reroll.


* jn/gitweb-utf8-in-links (2014-05-27) 1 commit
 - gitweb: Harden UTF-8 handling in generated links

 $gmane/250758?


* ss/userdiff-update-csharp-java (2014-06-02) 2 commits
 - userdiff: support Java try keyword
 - userdiff: support C# async methods and correct C# keywords

 Reviews sent; waiting for a response.


* bg/rebase-off-of-previous-branch (2014-04-16) 1 commit
 - git-rebase: print name of rev when using shorthand

 Teach "git rebase -" to report the concrete name of the branch
 (i.e. the previous one).

 But it stops short and does not do the same for "git rebase @{-1}".
 Expecting a reroll.


* rb/merge-prepare-commit-msg-hook (2014-01-10) 4 commits
 - merge: drop unused arg from abort_commit method signature
 - merge: make prepare_to_commit responsible for write_merge_state
 - t7505: ensure cleanup after hook blocks merge
 - t7505: add missing &&

 Expose more merge states (e.g. $GIT_DIR/MERGE_MODE) to hooks that
 run during "git merge".  The log message stresses too much on one
 hook, prepare-commit-msg, but it would equally apply to other hooks
 like post-merge, I think.

 Waiting for a reroll.


* jc/graph-post-root-gap (2013-12-30) 3 commits
 - WIP: document what we want at the end
 - graph: remove unused code a bit
 - graph: stuff the current commit into graph->columns[]

 This was primarily a RFH ($gmane/239580).


* tg/perf-lib-test-perf-cleanup (2013-09-19) 2 commits
 - perf-lib: add test_perf_cleanup target
 - perf-lib: split starting the test from the execution

 Add test_perf_cleanup shell function to the perf suite, that allows
 the script writers to define a test with a clean-up action.

 Will hold.


* jc/show-branch (2014-03-24) 5 commits
 - show-branch: use commit slab to represent bitflags of arbitrary width
 - show-branch.c: remove "all_mask"
 - show-branch.c: abstract out "flags" operation
 - show-branch.c: lift all_mask/all_revs to a global static
 - show-branch.c: update comment style

 Waiting for the final step to lift the hard-limit before sending it out.

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* tb/connect-ipv6-parse-fix (2015-02-22) 3 commits
 - t5500: show user name and host in diag-url
 - t5601: add more test cases for IPV6
 - connect.c: allow ssh://user@[2001:db8::1]/repo.git

 Waiting for comments from Brian who had objections to the previous
 round.


* ak/git-pm-typofix (2015-02-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-02-20 at 0fa233a)
 + Git.pm: two minor typo fixes

 Typofix in comments.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/decorate-leaky-separator-color (2015-02-20) 2 commits
 - config.txt: spell out how certain typed values are written
 - log --decorate: do not leak "commit" color into the next item

 "git log --decorate" did not reset colors correctly around the
 branch names.

 Waiting for discussion on the tip one.


* ms/submodule-update-config-doc (2015-02-20) 1 commit
 - submodule: Improve documentation of update subcommand

 The interaction between "git submodule update" and the
 submodule.*.update configuration was not clearly documented.


* dp/remove-duplicated-header-inclusion (2015-02-13) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-02-18 at a1bf108)
 + do not include the same header twice

 Code clean-up.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/diff-test-updates (2015-02-15) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-02-18 at f152c9f)
 + t4008: modernise style
 + t/diff-lib: check exact object names in compare_diff_raw
 + tests: do not borrow from COPYING and README from the real source
 + t4010: correct expected object names
 + t9300: correct expected object names
 + t4008: correct stale comments
 (this branch is used by jc/diff-b-m.)

 Test clean-up.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/send-email-sensible-encoding (2015-02-13) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-02-18 at 7457655)
 + send-email: ask confirmation if given encoding name is very short

 "git send-email" used to accept a mistaken "y" (or "yes") as an
 answer to "What encoding do you want to use [UTF-8]? " without
 questioning.  Now it asks for confirmation when the answer looks
 too short to be a valid encoding name.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/push-config (2015-02-17) 4 commits
 - [NEEDSACK] push: allow --follow-tags to be set by config push.followTags
 - cmd_push: pass "flags" pointer to config callback
 - cmd_push: set "atomic" bit directly
 - git_push_config: drop cargo-culted wt_status pointer

 Waiting for Ack and/or update for the tip one from Dave Olszewski
 ($gmane/263880, $gmane/263991).


* km/send-email-getopt-long-workarounds (2015-02-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-02-18 at 84c1597)
 + git-send-email.perl: support no- prefix with older GetOptions

 Even though we officially haven't dropped Perl 5.8 support, the
 Getopt::Long package that came with it does not support "--no-"
 prefix to negate a boolean option; manually add support to help
 people with older Getopt::Long package.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* mh/transport-capabilities (2015-02-13) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-02-18 at 87e8fcc)
 + transport-helper: ask the helper to set the same options for import as for fetch
 + transport-helper: ask the helper to set progress and verbosity options after asking for its capabilities

 The transport-helper did not give transport options such as
 verbosity, progress, cloning, etc. to import and export based
 helpers, like it did for fetch and push based helpers, robbing them
 the chance to honor the wish of the end-users better.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* sb/hex-object-name-is-at-most-41-bytes-long (2015-02-13) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-02-18 at 53d522b)
 + hex.c: reduce memory footprint of sha1_to_hex static buffers

 Code clean-up.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/daemon-interpolate (2015-02-17) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-02-20 at 21118a7)
 + daemon: sanitize incoming virtual hostname
 + t5570: test git-daemon's --interpolated-path option
 + git_connect: let user override virtual-host we send to daemon

 The "interpolated-path" option of "git daemon" inserted any string
 client declared on the "host=" capability request without checking.
 Sanitize and limit %H and %CH to a saner and a valid DNS name.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* rs/daemon-interpolate (2015-02-17) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-02-18 at c0f5750)
 + daemon: use callback to build interpolated path
 + daemon: look up client-supplied hostname lazily

 "git daemon" looked up the hostname even when "%CH" and "%IP"
 interpolations are not requested, which was unnecessary.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* sb/plug-leak-in-make-cache-entry (2015-02-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-02-18 at e637f65)
 + read-cache.c: free cache entry when refreshing fails

 "update-index --refresh" used to leak when an entry cannot be
 refreshed for whatever reason.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jn/doc-api-errors (2014-12-04) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-02-18 at f60eda6)
 + doc: document error handling functions and conventions

 The error handling functions and conventions are now documented in
 the API manual.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/sanity (2015-02-15) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-02-18 at 5c54b53)
 + test-lib.sh: set prerequisite SANITY by testing what we really need
 + tests: correct misuses of POSIXPERM
 + t/lib-httpd: switch SANITY check for NOT_ROOT

 The tests that wanted to see that file becomes unreadable after
 running "chmod a-r file", and the tests that wanted to make sure it
 is not run as root, we used "can we write into the / directory?" as
 a cheap substitute, but on some platforms that is not a good
 heuristics.  The tests and their prerequisites have been updated to
 check what they really require.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/max-io-size-and-ssize-max (2015-02-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-02-18 at 0c8a4da)
 + xread/xwrite: clip MAX_IO_SIZE to SSIZE_MAX

 Our default I/O size (8 MiB) for large files was too large for some
 platforms with smaller SSIZE_MAX, leading to read(2)/write(2)
 failures.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/fast-import-die-nicely-fix (2015-02-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-02-18 at e249425)
 + fast-import: avoid running end_packfile recursively

 "git fast-import" used to crash when it could not close and
 conclude the resulting packfile cleanly.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* mh/expire-updateref-fixes (2015-02-09) 10 commits
 - reflog_expire(): lock symbolic refs themselves, not their referent
 - reflog_expire(): never update a reference to null_sha1

 - Merge branch 'sb/atomic-push' into mh/ref-trans-value-check
 - Merge branch 'mh/reflog-expire' into mh/ref-trans-value-check

 Under discussion ($gmane/263552)


* mh/refs-have-new (2015-02-17) 13 commits
 - refs.h: remove duplication in function docstrings
 - update_ref(): improve documentation
 - ref_transaction_verify(): new function to check a reference's value
 - ref_transaction_delete(): check that old_sha1 is not null_sha1
 - ref_transaction_create(): check that new_sha1 is valid
 - commit: avoid race when creating orphan commits
 - commit: add tests of commit races
 - ref_transaction_delete(): remove "have_old" parameter
 - ref_transaction_update(): remove "have_old" parameter
 - struct ref_update: move "have_old" into "flags"
 - refs.c: change some "flags" to "unsigned int"
 - refs: remove the gap in the REF_* constant values
 - refs: move REF_DELETING to refs.c

 Simplify the ref transaction API around how "the ref should be
 pointing at this object" is specified.

 Looked sensible.
 Will merge to 'next', unless there is an objection.


* jc/apply-beyond-symlink (2015-02-10) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-02-18 at 4109de1)
 + apply: do not touch a file beyond a symbolic link
 + apply: do not read from beyond a symbolic link
 + apply: do not read from the filesystem under --index
 + apply: reject input that touches outside the working area

 "git apply" was not very careful about reading from, removing,
 updating and creating paths outside the working tree (under
 --index/--cached) or the current directory (when used as a
 replacement for GNU patch).

 Will merge to 'master'.


* tc/missing-http-proxyauth (2015-02-03) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-02-18 at 8ff01ad)
 + http: support curl < 7.10.7

 We did not check the curl library version before using
 CURLOPT_PROXYAUTH feature that may not exist.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/apply-ws-fix-expands-report (2015-01-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-02-18 at b571668)
 + apply: detect and mark whitespace errors in context lines when fixing

 "git apply --whitespace=fix" fixed whitespace errors in the common
 context lines but did so without reporting.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 - fsck: offer a function to demote fsck errors to warnings
 - fsck: provide a function to parse fsck message IDs
 - fsck: introduce identifiers for fsck messages
 - fsck: introduce fsck options

 "fsck.warnings = <list of error tokens>" I suggested turned out to
 be an unpopular choice (sorry Dscho).

 Expecting a reroll.


* jk/strbuf-doc-to-header (2015-01-16) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-02-18 at 0482c65)
 + strbuf.h: group documentation for trim functions

 Resolve the "doc vs header" to favor the latter.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* nd/attr-optim (2014-12-29) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-02-18 at 598e68a)
 + attr: avoid heavy work when we know the specified attr is not defined
 + attr: do not attempt to expand when we know it's not a macro
 + attr.c: rename arg name attr_nr to avoid shadowing the global one

 Optimize attribute look-up, mostly useful in "git grep" on a
 project that does not use many attributes, by avoiding it when we
 (should) know that the attributes are not defined in the first
 place.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 + fast-import: use git_path() for accessing .git dir instead of get_git_dir()
 + reflog: avoid constructing .lock path with git_path
 + *.sh: respect $GIT_INDEX_FILE
 + git_path(): be aware of file relocation in $GIT_DIR
 + path.c: group git_path(), git_pathdup() and strbuf_git_path() together
 + path.c: rename vsnpath() to do_git_path()
 + git_snpath(): retire and replace with strbuf_git_path()
 + path.c: make get_pathname() call sites return const char *
 + path.c: make get_pathname() return strbuf instead of static buffer

 A replacement for contrib/workdir/git-new-workdir that does not
 rely on symbolic links and make sharing of objects and refs safer
 by making the borrowee and borrowers aware of each other.

 Will cook in 'next'.

 Kyle's update to explicitly support --no-option with older
 Getopt::Long ($gmane/263203) makes this unnecessary.
