What's cooking in git.git (Sep 2017, #02; Mon, 11)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

We are at week #6 of this cycle.  It seems that people had a
productive week while I was away, which I am reasonably happy about
;-)  Quite a many topics that have been in 'master' are now also
merged to 'maint', so perhaps I should tag 2.14.2 soonish.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

* jk/drop-sha1-entry-pos (2017-08-25) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-25 at 7ef03bb281)
 + sha1-lookup: remove sha1_entry_pos() from header file

 Code clean-up.

  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-25 at 65933523ab)
 + send-email: don't use Mail::Address, even if available
 + send-email: fix garbage removal after address

 In addition to "cc: <a@dd.re.ss> # cruft", "cc: a@dd.re.ss # cruft"
 was taught to "git send-email" as a valid way to tell it that it
 needs to also send a carbon copy to <a@dd.re.ss> in the trailer
 section.


* nd/worktree-kill-parse-ref (2017-08-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-25 at a5da82b2ea)

 "git branch -M a b" while on a branch that is completely unrelated
 to either branch a or branch b misbehaved when multiple worktree
 was in use.  This has been fixed.

[New Topics]

* bb/doc-eol-dirty (2017-09-07) 1 commit
 - Documentation: mention that `eol` can change the dirty status of paths

 Doc update.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jh/hashmap-disable-counting (2017-09-07) 1 commit
 - hashmap: add API to disable item counting when threaded

 Our hashmap implementation in hashmap.[ch] is not thread-safe when
 adding a new item needs to expand the hashtable by rehashing; add
 an API to disable the automatic rehashing to work it around.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/incore-lockfile-removal (2017-09-06) 20 commits
 - stop leaking lock structs in some simple cases
 - ref_lock: stop leaking lock_files
 - lockfile: update lifetime requirements in documentation
 - tempfile: auto-allocate tempfiles on heap
 - tempfile: remove deactivated list entries
 - tempfile: use list.h for linked list
 - tempfile: release deactivated strbufs instead of resetting
 - tempfile: robustify cleanup handler
 - tempfile: factor out deactivation
 - tempfile: factor out activation
 - tempfile: replace die("BUG") with BUG()
 - tempfile: handle NULL tempfile pointers gracefully
 - tempfile: prefer is_tempfile_active to bare access
 - lockfile: do not rollback lock on failed close
 - tempfile: do not delete tempfile on failed close
 - always check return value of close_tempfile
 - verify_signed_buffer: prefer close_tempfile() to close()
 - setup_temporary_shallow: move tempfile struct into function
 - setup_temporary_shallow: avoid using inactive tempfile
 - write_index_as_tree: cleanup tempfile on error

 The long-standing rule that an in-core lockfile instance, once it
 is used, must not be freed, has been lifted and the lockfile and
 tempfile APIs have been updated to reduce the chance of programming
 errors.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/leak-checkers (2017-09-08) 10 commits
 - add UNLEAK annotation for reducing leak false positives
 - set_git_dir: handle feeding gitdir to itself
 - repository: free fields before overwriting them
 - reset: free allocated tree buffers
 - reset: make tree counting less confusing
 - config: plug user_config leak
 - update-index: fix cache entry leak in add_one_file()
 - add: free leaked pathspec after add_files_to_cache()
 - test-lib: set LSAN_OPTIONS to abort by default
 - test-lib: --valgrind should not override --verbose-log

 Many of our programs consider that it is OK to release dynamic
 storage that is used throughout the life of the program by simply
 exiting, but this makes it harder to leak detection tools to avoid
 reporting false positives.  Plug many existing leaks and introduce
 a mechanism for developers to mark that the region of memory
 pointed by a pointer is not lost/leaking to help these tools.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/system-path-cleanup (2017-09-07) 2 commits
 - git_extract_argv0_path: do nothing without RUNTIME_PREFIX
 - system_path: move RUNTIME_PREFIX to a sub-function

 A handful of tests to demonstrates a recursive implementation of
 "name-rev" hurts.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* rk/commit-tree-make-F-verbatim (2017-09-10) 1 commit
 - commit-tree: do not complete line in -F input

 Unlike "git commit-tree < file", "git commit-tree -F file" did not
 pass the contents of the file verbatim and instead completed an
 incomplete line at the end, if exists.  The latter has been updated
 to match the behaviour of the former.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sb/merge-commit-msg-hook (2017-09-08) 1 commit
 - builtin/merge: honor commit-msg hook for merges

 As "git commit" to conclude a conflicted "git merge" honors the
 commit-msg hook, "git merge" that recoreds a merge commit that
 cleanly auto-merges should, but it didn't.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 The scripts to drive TravisCI has been reorganized and then an
 optimization to avoid spending cycles on a branch whose tip is
 tagged has been implemented.

* sg/clone-refspec-from-command-line-config (2017-06-16) 2 commits
 - Documentation/clone: document ignored configuration variables
 - clone: respect additional configured fetch refspecs during initial fetch
 (this branch is used by sg/remote-no-string-refspecs.)

 "git clone -c var=val" is a way to set configuration variables in
 the resulting repository, but it is more useful to also make these
 variables take effect while the initial clone is happening,
 e.g. these configuration variables could be fetch refspecs.

 Waiting for a response.

 objects that are in use only in other worktrees to be subject to
 garbage collection.

* mk/diff-delta-uint-may-be-shorter-than-ulong (2017-08-10) 1 commit
 . diff-delta: fix encoding size that would not fit in "unsigned int"

 The machinery to create xdelta used in pack files received the
 sizes of the data in size_t, but lost the higher bits of them by
 storing them in "unsigned int" during the computation, which is
 fixed.

 Dropped, as it was rerolled for review as part of a larger series.

 - http: drop support for curl < 7.19.4
 - http: drop support for curl < 7.16.0
 - http: drop support for curl < 7.11.1

 Some code in http.c that has bitrot is being removed.

 Will be rerolled after tc/curl-with-backports stabilizes.


* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2017-08-10) 1 commit
 . zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

* mk/diff-delta-avoid-large-offset (2017-08-11) 1 commit
 . diff-delta: do not allow delta offset truncation

 The delta format used in the packfile cannot reference data at
 offset larger than what can be expressed in 4-byte, but the
 generator for the data failed to make sure the offset does not
 overflow.  This has been corrected.

 - clang-format: outline the git project's coding style

 "make style" runs git-clang-format to help developers by pointing
 out coding style issues.


* sb/submodule-recursive-checkout-detach-head (2017-07-28) 2 commits
 - Documentation/checkout: clarify submodule HEADs to be detached
 - recursive submodules: detach HEAD from new state

 "git checkout --recursive" may overwrite and rewind the history of
 the branch that happens to be checked out in submodule
 repositories, which might not be desirable.  Detach the HEAD but
 still allow the recursive checkout to succeed in such a case.

 Undecided.
 This needs justification in a larger picture; it is unclear why
 this is better than rejecting recursive checkout, for example.


* ti/external-sha1dc (2017-08-16) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-26 at a0fb4e91a5)

 - push: disable lazy --force-with-lease by default

 Because "git push --force-with-lease[=<ref>]" that relies on the
 stability of remote-tracking branches is unsafe when something
 fetches into the repository behind user's back, it is now disabled
 by default.  A new configuration variable can be used to enable it
 by users who know what they are doing.  This would pave the way to
 possibly turn `--force` into `--force-with-lease`.

 Will discard.
 Independent from disabling the feature by default, this stirred up
 a discussion to replace the DWIM heuristics with a better one, which
 deserves to be its own topic.

 + pathspec: die on empty strings as pathspec
 + t0027: do not use an empty string as a pathspec element

 The final step to make an empty string as a pathspec element
 illegal.  We started this by first deprecating and warning a
 pathspec that has such an element in 2.11 (Nov 2016).

 Hopefully we can merge this down to the 'master' by the end of the
 year?  A deprecation warning period that is about 1 year does not
 sound too bad.

 Will cook in 'next'.
 As the draft RelNotes says, let's merge this to 'master' after
 this release cycle.


* sd/branch-copy (2017-06-18) 3 commits
 - branch: add a --copy (-c) option to go with --move (-m)
 - branch: add test for -m renaming multiple config sections
 - config: create a function to format section headers

 "git branch" learned "-c/-C" to create and switch to a new branch
 by copying an existing one.

 I personally do not think "branch --copy master backup" while on
 "master" that switches to "backup" is a good UI, and I *will* say
 "I told you so" when users complain after we merge this down to
 'master'.
