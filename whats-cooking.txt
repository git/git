What's cooking in git.git (Feb 2019, #01; Tue, 5)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

A handful more topics have been merged to 'master' and 'next'
respectively.  I have been hoping to keep this cycle short compared
to other recent cycles but there are a few smallish changes that we
should have in the upcoming release but are still not in 'next'. We
will see what happens.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

[Graduated to "master"]

* ab/commit-graph-write-optim (2019-01-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-29 at 17c894dfec)
 + commit-graph write: use pack order when finding commits
 (this branch is used by ab/commit-graph-write-progress and ds/commit-graph-format-v2.)

 The codepath to write out commit-graph has been optimized by
 following the usual pattern of visiting objects in in-pack order.


* ab/commit-graph-write-progress (2019-01-23) 9 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-29 at e086b1cba6)
 + commit-graph write: emit a percentage for all progress
 + commit-graph write: add itermediate progress
 + commit-graph write: remove empty line for readability
 + commit-graph write: add more descriptive progress output
 + commit-graph write: show progress for object search
 + commit-graph write: more descriptive "writing out" output
 + commit-graph write: add "Writing out" progress output
 + commit-graph: don't call write_graph_chunk_extra_edges() unnecessarily
 + commit-graph: rename "large edges" to "extra edges"
 (this branch is used by ds/commit-graph-format-v2; uses ab/commit-graph-write-optim.)

 The codepath to show progress meter while writing out commit-graph
 file has been improved.


* az/instaweb-py3-http-server (2019-01-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-29 at 82f06b6774)
 + git-instaweb: add Python builtin http.server support

 "git instaweb" learned to drive http.server that comes with
 "batteries included" Python installation (both Python2 & 3).


* bp/checkout-new-branch-optim (2019-01-23) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-29 at 89d690634d)
 + checkout: fix regression in checkout -b on intitial checkout
 + checkout: add test demonstrating regression with checkout -b on initial commit

 "git checkout -b <new> [HEAD]" to create a new branch from the
 current commit and check it out ought to be a no-op in the index
 and the working tree in normal cases, but there are corner cases
 that do require updates to the index and the working tree.  Running
 it immediately after "git clone --no-checkout" is one of these
 cases that an earlier optimization kicked in incorrectly, which has
 been fixed.


* cc/test-ref-store-typofix (2019-01-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-29 at 0cd264f864)
 + helper/test-ref-store: fix "new-sha1" vs "old-sha1" typo

 An obvious typo in an assertion error message has been fixed.


* ja/doc-style-fix (2019-01-23) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-29 at 5b520a6fd3)
 + doc: tidy asciidoc style

 Doc typo/stylo fixes.


* jk/add-ignore-errors-bit-assignment-fix (2019-01-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-29 at a4ac7ccd4f)
 + add: use separate ADD_CACHE_RENORMALIZE flag

 "git add --ignore-errors" did not work as advertised and instead
 worked as an unintended synonym for "git add --renormalize", which
 has been fixed.


* jk/attr-macro-fix (2019-01-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-29 at 740df172e1)
 + attr: do not mark queried macros as unset

 Asking "git check-attr" about a macro (e.g. "binary") on a specific
 path did not work correctly, even though "git check-attr -a" listed
 such a macro correctly.  This has been corrected.


* jk/diff-cc-stat-fixes (2019-01-24) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-29 at 8bd04f1749)
 + combine-diff: treat --dirstat like --stat
 + combine-diff: treat --summary like --stat
 + combine-diff: treat --shortstat like --stat
 + combine-diff: factor out stat-format mask
 + diff: clear emitted_symbols flag after use
 + t4006: resurrect commented-out tests

 "git diff --color-moved --cc --stat -p" did not work well due to
 funny interaction between a bug in color-moved and the rest, which
 has been fixed.


* js/abspath-part-inside-repo (2019-01-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-29 at ac642158ec)
 + abspath_part_inside_repo: respect core.ignoreCase

 On a case-insensitive filesystem, we failed to compare the part of
 the path that is above the worktree directory in an absolute
 pathname, which has been corrected.


* js/commit-graph-chunk-table-fix (2019-01-15) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-29 at 65ea01d4f2)
 + Makefile: correct example fuzz build
 + commit-graph: fix buffer read-overflow
 + commit-graph, fuzz: add fuzzer for commit-graph

 The codepath to read from the commit-graph file attempted to read
 past the end of it when the file's table-of-contents was corrupt.


* js/filter-options-should-use-plain-int (2019-01-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-18 at 6714547e6d)
 + filter-options: expand scaled numbers
 (this branch uses md/list-objects-filter-by-depth and sb/more-repo-in-api; is tangled with jt/get-reference-with-commit-graph.)

 Update the protocol message specification to allow only the limited
 use of scaled quantities.  This is ensure potential compatibility
 issues will not go out of hand.


* js/mingw-unc-path-w-backslashes (2019-01-18) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-29 at 3adc177c1e)
 + mingw: special-case arguments to `sh`
 + mingw (t5580): document bug when cloning from backslashed UNC paths

 In Git for Windows, "git clone \\server\share\path" etc. that uses
 UNC paths from command line had bad interaction with its shell
 emulation.


* js/t6042-timing-fix (2019-01-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-29 at 9543c96249)
 + t6042: work around speed optimization on Windows

 Test update.


* js/test-git-installed (2019-01-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-29 at bab6eabb20)
 + tests: explicitly use `test-tool.exe` on Windows

 Test fix for Windows.


* jt/fetch-v2-sideband (2019-01-17) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-29 at c8c6f11f77)
 + tests: define GIT_TEST_SIDEBAND_ALL
 + {fetch,upload}-pack: sideband v2 fetch response
 + sideband: reverse its dependency on pkt-line
 + pkt-line: introduce struct packet_writer
 + Merge branch 'ms/packet-err-check' into jt/fetch-v2-sideband
 (this branch uses ms/packet-err-check.)

 "git fetch" and "git upload-pack" learned to send all exchange over
 the sideband channel while talking the v2 protocol.


* jt/get-reference-with-commit-graph (2018-12-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-18 at bfc4eb9411)
 + revision: use commit graph in get_reference()
 (this branch uses sb/more-repo-in-api; is tangled with js/filter-options-should-use-plain-int and md/list-objects-filter-by-depth.)

 Micro-optimize the code that prepares commit objects to be walked
 by "git rev-list" when the commit-graph is available.


* jt/namespaced-ls-refs-fix (2019-01-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-29 at 049530f499)
 + ls-refs: filter refs using namespace-stripped name

 Fix namespace support in protocol v2.


* ld/git-p4-shelve-update-fix (2019-01-18) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-29 at 02e8752ec8)
 + git-p4: handle update of moved/copied files when updating a shelve
 + git-p4: add failing test for shelved CL update involving move/copy

 "git p4" failed to update a shelved change when there were moved
 files, which has been corrected.


* md/list-objects-filter-by-depth (2019-01-15) 4 commits
 + tree:<depth>: skip some trees even when collecting omits
 + list-objects-filter: teach tree:# how to handle >0
 + Merge branch 'nd/the-index' into md/list-objects-filter-by-depth
 + Merge branch 'sb/more-repo-in-api' into md/list-objects-filter-by-depth
 (this branch is used by js/filter-options-should-use-plain-int; uses sb/more-repo-in-api; is tangled with jt/get-reference-with-commit-graph.)


* ms/packet-err-check (2019-01-02) 2 commits
 + pack-protocol.txt: accept error packets in any context
 + Use packet_reader instead of packet_read_line
 (this branch is used by jt/fetch-v2-sideband.)

 Error checking of data sent over the pack-protocol has been
 revamped so that error packets are always diagnosed properly.


* nd/fetch-compact-update (2019-01-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-29 at b78e8841b0)
 + fetch: prefer suffix substitution in compact fetch.output

 "git fetch" output cleanup.


* ph/pack-objects-mutex-fix (2019-01-28) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-29 at 7c886f6c33)
 + pack-objects: merge read_lock and lock in packing_data struct
 + pack-objects: move read mutex to packing_data struct

 "git pack-objects" incorrectly used uninitialized mutex, which has
 been corrected.


* pw/no-editor-in-rebase-i-implicit (2019-01-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-29 at 9d06993725)
 + implicit interactive rebase: don't run sequence editor

 When GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR is set, the command was incorrectly
 started when modes of "git rebase" that implicitly uses the
 machinery for the interactive rebase are run, which has been
 corrected.


* sb/more-repo-in-api (2018-12-28) 23 commits
 + t/helper/test-repository: celebrate independence from the_repository
 + path.h: make REPO_GIT_PATH_FUNC repository agnostic
 + commit: prepare free_commit_buffer and release_commit_memory for any repo

 + sha1_file: allow read_object to read objects in arbitrary repositories
 (this branch is used by js/filter-options-should-use-plain-int, jt/get-reference-with-commit-graph and md/list-objects-filter-by-depth.)

 The in-core repository instances are passed through more codepaths.


* sg/object-as-type-commit-graph-fix (2019-01-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-29 at cc714a044a)
 + object_as_type: initialize commit-graph-related fields of 'struct commit'

 The commit-graph facility did not work when in-core objects that
 are promoted from unknown type to commit (e.g. a commit that is
 accessed via a tag that refers to it) were involved, which has been
 corrected.


* sg/obstack-cast-function-type-fix (2019-01-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-29 at 568cafa7f4)
 + compat/obstack: fix -Wcast-function-type warnings

 The compat/obstack code had casts that -Wcast-function-type
 compilation option found questionable.

  (merged to 'next' on 2019-01-29 at a9f7279d38)
 + strbuf.cocci: suggest strbuf_addbuf() to add one strbuf to an other

 Cocci rule update.

 + diff-tree doc: correct & remove wrong documentation

 Doc fix.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* bc/fetch-pack-clear-alternate-shallow (2019-02-04) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-02-05 at 14392fb6b2)
 + fetch-pack: clear alternate shallow when complete

 "git fetch" over protocol v2 that needs to make a second connection
 to backfill tags did not clear a variable that holds shallow
 repository information correctly, leading to an access of freed
 piece of memory.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* dm/some-stdio-functions-are-macro-on-freebsd (2019-02-01) 1 commit
 - http: cast result to FILE *

 Variants of BSD define fileno(fh) as a macro, breaking a program
 that passes a "void *" to it.

 original trees to the output.

 Running "Documentation/doc-diff x" from anywhere other than the

  (merged to 'next' on 2019-02-05 at 6a1d957040)
 + travis-ci: make the OSX build jobs' 'brew update' more quiet

 The way the OSX build jobs updates its build environment used the
 "--quiet" option to "brew update" command, but it wasn't all that
 quiet to be useful.  The use of the option has been replaced with
 an explicit redirection to the /dev/null (which incidentally would
 have worked around a breakage by recent updates to homebrew, which
 has fixed itself already).

* sh/submodule-summary-abbrev-fix (2019-02-04) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-02-05 at b45b39c30b)
 + git-submodule.sh: shorten submodule SHA-1s using rev-parse

 The "git submodule summary" subcommand showed shortened commit
 object names by mechanically truncating them at 7-hexdigit, which
 has been improved to let "rev-parse --short" scale the length of
 the abbreviation with the size of the repository.

 corrected.

* nd/diff-parseopt (2019-01-27) 14 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-02-05 at 7c4b79aa79)
 + diff.c: convert --raw

 The diff machinery, one of the oldest parts of the system, which
 long predates the parse-options API, uses fairly long and complex
 handcrafted option parser.  This is being rewritten to use the
 parse-options API.

 Will cook in 'next', waiting for the remainder.
 Looking good.

 The assumption to work on the single "in-core index" instance has
 been reduced from the library-ish part of the codebase.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* wh/author-committer-ident-config (2019-02-04) 1 commit
 - config: allow giving separate author and committer idents

 Four new configuration variables {author,committer}.{name,email}
 have been introduced to override user.{name,email} in more specific
 cases.


* js/rebase-am (2019-01-18) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-02-05 at cb92db8ecf)
 + built-in rebase: call `git am` directly
 + rebase: teach `reset_head()` to optionally skip the worktree
 + rebase: avoid double reflog entry when switching branches
 + rebase: move `reset_head()` into a better spot

 Instead of going through "git-rebase--am" scriptlet to use the "am"
 backend, the built-in version of "git rebase" learned to drive the
 "am" backend directly.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 + Add `human` date format tests.
 + Add `human` format to test-tool
 + Add 'human' date format documentation
 + Replace the proposed 'auto' mode with 'auto:'
 + Add 'human' date format

 A new date format "--date=human" that morphs its output depending
 on how far the time is from the current time has been introduced.
 "--date=auto" can be used to use this new format when the output is
 going to the pager or to the terminal and otherwise the default
 format.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 coalesce small pack files that are still in use.

 Comments?


* ds/push-sparse-tree-walk (2019-01-17) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-02-05 at 9fd04c84d6)
 + pack-objects: create GIT_TEST_PACK_SPARSE
 + pack-objects: create pack.useSparse setting
 + revision: implement sparse algorithm
 + list-objects: consume sparse tree walk
 + revision: add mark_tree_uninteresting_sparse

 "git pack-objects" learned another algorithm to compute the set of
 objects to send, that trades the resulting packfile off to save
 traversal cost to favor small pushes.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* tg/checkout-no-overlay (2019-02-04) 9 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-02-04 at 9968bcf4fb)

 + checkout: introduce checkout.overlayMode config
 + checkout: introduce --{,no-}overlay option
 + checkout: factor out mark_cache_entry_for_checkout function
 + checkout: clarify comment
 + read-cache: add invalidate parameter to remove_marked_cache_entries

 + entry: factor out unlink_entry function
 + move worktree tests to t24*

 "git checkout --no-overlay" can be used to trigger a new mode of
 checking out paths out of the tree-ish, that allows paths that
 match the pathspec that are in the current index and working tree
 and are not in the tree-ish.

 Will hold.
 Waiting for "restore-files" & "switch-branches" pair.

* dl/merge-cleanup-scissors-fix (2019-01-27) 4 commits
 - merge: add scissors line on merge conflict
 - merge: cleanup messages like commit
 - t7600: clean up 'merge --squash c3 with c7' test
 - commit: extract cleanup_mode functions to sequencer

 The list of conflicted paths shown in the editor while concluding a
 conflicted merge was shown above the scissors line when the
 clean-up mode is set to "scissors", even though it was commented
 out just like the list of updated paths and other information to
 help the user explain the merge better.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 - pretty: allow %(trailers) options with explicit value
 - doc: group pretty-format.txt placeholders descriptions

 The %(trailers) formatter in "git log --format=..."  now allows to
 optionally pick trailers selectively by keyword, show only values,
 etc.

 Comments?


* jn/unknown-index-extensions (2018-11-21) 2 commits
 - index: offer advice for unknown index extensions
 - index: do not warn about unrecognized extensions

 A bit too alarming warning given when unknown index extensions
 exist is getting revamped.

 Expecting a reroll.


* en/rebase-merge-on-sequencer (2019-01-07) 8 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-02-05 at 88823d7c86)

 + rebase: define linearization ordering and enforce it
 + git-legacy-rebase: simplify unnecessary triply-nested if
 + git-rebase, sequencer: extend --quiet option for the interactive machinery
 + am, rebase--merge: do not overlook --skip'ed commits with post-rewrite
 + t5407: add a test demonstrating how interactive handles --skip differently
 + rebase: fix incompatible options error message
 + rebase: make builtin and legacy script error messages the same

 "git rebase --merge" as been reimplemented by reusing the internal
 machinery used for "git rebase -i".

 Will merge to 'master'.


* dl/remote-save-to-push (2018-12-11) 1 commit
 - remote: add --save-to-push option to git remote set-url

 "git remote set-url" learned a new option that moves existing value
 of the URL field to pushURL field of the remote before replacing
 the URL field with a new value.

 I am personally not yet quite convinced if this is worth pursuing.


* js/protocol-advertise-multi (2018-12-28) 1 commit
 - protocol: advertise multiple supported versions

 The transport layer has been updated so that the protocol version
 used can be negotiated between the parties, by the initiator
 listing the protocol versions it is willing to talk, and the other
 side choosing from one of them.

 Is this ready for 'next'?


* js/smart-http-detect-remote-error (2019-01-07) 3 commits
 - remote-curl: die on server-side errors
 - remote-curl: tighten "version 2" check for smart-http
 - remote-curl: refactor smart-http discovery

 Some errors from the other side coming over smart HTTP transport
 were not noticed, which has been corrected.

 This needs to be rebased on top of a more recent 'master' that has
 ms/packet-err-check.


* nb/branch-show-other-worktrees-head (2019-02-01) 3 commits
 - branch: add an extra verbose output displaying worktree path for refs checked out in a linked worktree
 - branch: mark and color a branch differently if it is checked out in a linked worktree
 - ref-filter: add worktreepath atom

 "git branch --list" learned to show branches that are checked out
 in other worktrees connected to the same repository prefixed with
 '+', similar to the way the currently checked out branch is shown
 with '*' in front.

 The second one is of dubious value.


* js/vsts-ci (2019-01-29) 21 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-02-05 at 7297a734c7)

 Prepare to run test suite on Azure Pipeline.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* du/branch-show-current (2018-10-26) 1 commit
 - branch: introduce --show-current display option

 "git branch" learned a new subcommand "--show-current".

 I am personally not yet quite convinced if this is worth pursuing.


* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2018-10-15) 1 commit
 - zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".


* ag/sequencer-reduce-rewriting-todo (2019-01-29) 16 commits
 - rebase--interactive: move transform_todo_file() to rebase--interactive.c
 - sequencer: use edit_todo_list() in complete_action()
 - rebase-interactive: rewrite edit_todo_list() to handle the initial edit
 - rebase-interactive: append_todo_help() changes
 - rebase-interactive: use todo_list_write_to_file() in edit_todo_list()
 - sequencer: refactor skip_unnecessary_picks() to work on a todo_list
 - sequencer: change complete_action() to use the refactored functions
 - sequencer: make sequencer_make_script() write its script to a strbuf
 - sequencer: refactor rearrange_squash() to work on a todo_list
 - sequencer: refactor sequencer_add_exec_commands() to work on a todo_list
 - sequencer: refactor check_todo_list() to work on a todo_list
 - sequencer: introduce todo_list_write_to_file()
 - sequencer: refactor transform_todos() to work on a todo_list
 - sequencer: remove the 'arg' field from todo_item
 - sequencer: make the todo_list structure public
 - sequencer: changes in parse_insn_buffer()

 The scripted version of "git rebase -i" wrote and rewrote the todo
 list many times during a single step of its operation, and the
 recent C-rewrite made a faithful conversion of the logic to C.  The
 implementation has been updated to carry necessary information
 around in-core to avoid rewriting the same file over and over
 unnecessarily.

 Still being worked on.

 "git stash" rewritten in C.

 On hold, waiting for a response
 cf. <xmqqzhraru5x.fsf@gitster-ct.c.googlers.com>
 I personally do not mind "oops, this was wrong and I am too lazy to
 redo the history to clean it up" too much, but waiting briefly to
 give the final chance to do so.


* pw/add-p-select (2018-07-26) 4 commits
 - add -p: optimize line selection for short hunks
 - add -p: allow line selection to be inverted
 - add -p: select modified lines correctly
 - add -p: select individual hunk lines

 "git add -p" interactive interface learned to let users choose
 individual added/removed lines to be used in the operation, instead
 of accepting or rejecting a whole hunk.

 Will discard.
 No further feedbacks on the topic for quite some time.

 cf. <d622a95b-7302-43d4-4ec9-b2cf3388c653@talktalk.net>
 I found the feature to be hard to explain, and may result in more
 end-user complaints, but let's see.
