What's cooking in git.git (Sep 2017, #01; Wed, 6)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

We are at week #5 of this cycle.  It seems that people had a
productive week while I was away, which I am reasonably happy about
;-)

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

[Graduated to "master"]

* ks/branch-set-upstream (2017-08-17) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-22 at 10fd938390)
 + branch: quote branch/ref names to improve readability
 + builtin/branch: stop supporting the "--set-upstream" option
 + t3200: cleanup cruft of a test

 "branch --set-upstream" that has been deprecated in Git 1.8 has
 finally been retired.


* po/read-graft-line (2017-08-18) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-22 at 1e3fe0d3a1)
 + commit: rewrite read_graft_line
 + commit: allocate array using object_id size
 + commit: replace the raw buffer with strbuf in read_graft_line
 + sha1_file: fix definition of null_sha1

 Conversion from uchar[20] to struct object_id continues; this is to
 ensure that we do not assume sizeof(struct object_id) is the same
 as the length of SHA-1 hash (or length of longest hash we support).


* rs/archive-excluded-directory (2017-08-19) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-22 at 1853597c35)
 + archive: don't queue excluded directories
 + archive: factor out helper functions for handling attributes
 + t5001: add tests for export-ignore attributes and exclude pathspecs

 "git archive" did not work well with pathspecs and the
 export-ignore attribute.

 We may want to resurrect the "we don't archive an empty directory"
 bonus patch, but I do not mind merging the above early to 'next'
 and leave it as a separate follow-up enhancement.

 - Documentation/clone: document ignored configuration variables
 - clone: respect additional configured fetch refspecs during initial fetch
 (this branch is used by sg/remote-no-string-refspecs.)

 "git clone -c var=val" is a way to set configuration variables in
 the resulting repository, but it is more useful to also make these
 variables take effect while the initial clone is happening,
 e.g. these configuration variables could be fetch refspecs.

 Waiting for a response.

 + branch: fix branch renaming not updating HEADs correctly

 "git branch -M a b" while on a branch that is completely unrelated
 to either branch a or branch b misbehaved when multiple worktree

* nd/prune-in-worktree (2017-08-24) 16 commits
 - refs.c: reindent get_submodule_ref_store()
 - refs.c: remove fallback-to-main-store code get_submodule_ref_store()
 - rev-list: expose and document --single-worktree
 - revision.c: --reflog add HEAD reflog from all worktrees
 - files-backend: make reflog iterator go through per-worktree reflog
 - revision.c: --all adds HEAD from all worktrees
 - refs: remove dead for_each_*_submodule()
 - refs.c: move for_each_remote_ref_submodule() to submodule.c
 - revision.c: use refs_for_each*() instead of for_each_*_submodule()
 - refs: add refs_head_ref()
 - refs: move submodule slash stripping code to get_submodule_ref_store
 - refs.c: refactor get_submodule_ref_store(), share common free block

 - revision.c: refactor add_index_objects_to_pending()
 - refs.c: use is_dir_sep() in resolve_gitlink_ref()
 - revision.h: new flag in struct rev_info wrt. worktree-related refs

 "git gc" and friends when multiple worktrees are used off of a
 single repository did not consider the index and per-worktree refs
 of other worktrees as the root for reachability traversal, making
 objects that are in use only in other worktrees to be subject to
 garbage collection.

* mk/diff-delta-uint-may-be-shorter-than-ulong (2017-08-10) 1 commit
 . diff-delta: fix encoding size that would not fit in "unsigned int"

 The machinery to create xdelta used in pack files received the
 sizes of the data in size_t, but lost the higher bits of them by
 storing them in "unsigned int" during the computation, which is
 fixed.

 Dropped, as it was rerolled for review as part of a larger series.
 cf. <1502914591-26215-1-git-send-email-martin@mail.zuhause>


* jk/drop-ancient-curl (2017-08-09) 5 commits
 - http: #error on too-old curl
 - curl: remove ifdef'd code never used with curl >=7.19.4
 - http: drop support for curl < 7.19.4
 - http: drop support for curl < 7.16.0
 - http: drop support for curl < 7.11.1

 Some code in http.c that has bitrot is being removed.

 Will be rerolled after tc/curl-with-backports stabilizes.


* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2017-08-10) 1 commit
 . zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

 Dropped, as it was rerolled for review as part of a larger series.
 cf. <1502914591-26215-1-git-send-email-martin@mail.zuhause>


* mk/diff-delta-avoid-large-offset (2017-08-11) 1 commit
 . diff-delta: do not allow delta offset truncation

 The delta format used in the packfile cannot reference data at
 offset larger than what can be expressed in 4-byte, but the
 generator for the data failed to make sure the offset does not
 overflow.  This has been corrected.

 Dropped, as it was rerolled for review as part of a larger series.

* bw/git-clang-format (2017-08-14) 2 commits
 - Makefile: add style build rule
 - clang-format: outline the git project's coding style

 "make style" runs git-clang-format to help developers by pointing
 out coding style issues.


* sb/submodule-recursive-checkout-detach-head (2017-07-28) 2 commits
 - Documentation/checkout: clarify submodule HEADs to be detached
 - recursive submodules: detach HEAD from new state

 "git checkout --recursive" may overwrite and rewind the history of
 the branch that happens to be checked out in submodule
 repositories, which might not be desirable.  Detach the HEAD but
 still allow the recursive checkout to succeed in such a case.

 Undecided.
 This needs justification in a larger picture; it is unclear why
 this is better than rejecting recursive checkout, for example.


* ti/external-sha1dc (2017-08-16) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-26 at a0fb4e91a5)
 + sha1dc: allow building with the external sha1dc library
 + sha1dc: build git plumbing code more explicitly

 Platforms that ship with a separate sha1 with collision detection
 library can link to it instead of using the copy we ship as part of
 our source tree.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/check-ref-format-oor-fix (2017-07-14) 1 commit
 - check-ref-format: require a repository for --branch

* jc/allow-lazy-cas (2017-07-06) 1 commit
 - push: disable lazy --force-with-lease by default

 Because "git push --force-with-lease[=<ref>]" that relies on the
 stability of remote-tracking branches is unsafe when something
 fetches into the repository behind user's back, it is now disabled
 by default.  A new configuration variable can be used to enable it
 by users who know what they are doing.  This would pave the way to
 possibly turn `--force` into `--force-with-lease`.

 Will discard.
 Independent from disabling the feature by default, this stirred up
 a discussion to replace the DWIM heuristics with a better one, which
 deserves to be its own topic.
 cf. <alpine.DEB.2.21.1.1707131435220.4193@virtualbox>


* ex/deprecate-empty-pathspec-as-match-all (2017-06-23) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-14 at 24db08a6e8)
 + pathspec: die on empty strings as pathspec
 + t0027: do not use an empty string as a pathspec element

 The final step to make an empty string as a pathspec element
 illegal.  We started this by first deprecating and warning a
 pathspec that has such an element in 2.11 (Nov 2016).

 Hopefully we can merge this down to the 'master' by the end of the
 year?  A deprecation warning period that is about 1 year does not
 sound too bad.

 Will cook in 'next'.
 As the draft RelNotes says, let's merge this to 'master' after
 this release cycle.


* sd/branch-copy (2017-06-18) 3 commits
 - branch: add a --copy (-c) option to go with --move (-m)
 - branch: add test for -m renaming multiple config sections
 - config: create a function to format section headers

 "git branch" learned "-c/-C" to create and switch to a new branch
 by copying an existing one.

 I personally do not think "branch --copy master backup" while on
 "master" that switches to "backup" is a good UI, and I *will* say
 "I told you so" when users complain after we merge this down to
 'master'.

* jc/apply-with-crlf (2017-08-16) 5 commits
 . apply: clarify read_old_data() is about no-index case
 . apply: localize the CRLF business to read_old_data()
 . apply: only pay attention to CRLF in the preimage
 . apply: remove unused field apply_state.flags
