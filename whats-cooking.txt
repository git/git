What's cooking in git.git (Jun 2016, #04; Tue, 14)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

Git 2.9 has been tagged.  Let's wait for a few days to clean up
possible fallout and then start a new cycle by rewinding the tip of
'next'.  I expect I'd eject a few premature topics out of 'next'
while doing so.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* jc/t2300-setup (2016-06-01) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-06-06 at 20f7f83)
 + t2300: run git-sh-setup in an environment that better mimics the real life
 (this branch is used by va/i18n-even-more.)

 A test fix.


* jk/diff-compact-heuristic (2016-06-10) 1 commit
 - diff: disable compaction heuristic for now

 It turns out that the earlier effort to update the heuristics may
 want to use a bit more time to mature.  Turn it off by default.


* jk/shell-portability (2016-06-01) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-06-06 at 5de784e)
 + t5500 & t7403: lose bash-ism "local"
 + test-lib: add in-shell "env" replacement

 test fixes.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* lv/status-say-working-tree-not-directory (2016-06-09) 1 commit
 - Use "working tree" instead of "working directory" for git status

 "git status" used to say "working directory" when it meant "working
 tree".

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/parseopt-string-list (2016-06-13) 3 commits
 - blame,shortlog: don't make local option variables static
 - interpret-trailers: don't duplicate option strings
 - parse_opt_string_list: stop allocating new strings
 (this branch is used by jk/string-list-static-init.)

 The command line argument parsing that uses OPT_STRING_LIST() often
 made a copy of the argv[] element, which was unnecessary.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/repack-keep-unreachable (2016-06-14) 3 commits
 - repack: extend --keep-unreachable to loose objects
 - repack: add --keep-unreachable option
 - repack: document --unpack-unreachable option

 "git repack" learned the "--keep-unreachable" option, which sends
 loose unreachable objects to a pack instead of leaving them loose.
 This helps heuristics based on the number of loose objects
 (e.g. "gc --auto").

 Will merge to 'next'.


* lf/recv-sideband-cleanup (2016-06-13) 1 commit
 - sideband.c: refactor recv_sideband()

 Code simplification.  It however loses the atomicity of the output
 9ac13ec9 (atomic write for sideband remote messages, 2006-10-11)
 tried to add to an once-much-simpler codebase.

 Expecting a reroll.


* nd/test-lib-httpd-show-error-log-in-verbose (2016-06-13) 1 commit
 - lib-httpd.sh: print error.log on error

 Debugging aid.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* pc/occurred (2016-06-10) 2 commits
 - config.c: fix misspelt "occurred" in an error message
 - refs.h: fix misspelt "occurred" in a comment

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sb/submodule-clone-retry (2016-06-13) 2 commits
 - submodule update: continue when a clone fails
 - submodule--helper: initial clone learns retry logic
 (this branch uses sb/submodule-recommend-shallowness.)

 "git submodule update" that drives many "git clone" could
 eventually hit flaky servers/network conditions on one of the
 submodules; the command learned to retry the attempt.


* jc/blame-reverse (2016-06-14) 2 commits
 - blame: dwim "blame --reverse OLD" as "blame --reverse OLD.."
 - blame: improve diagnosis for "--reverse NEW"


* jc/deref-tag (2016-06-14) 1 commit
 - blame, line-log: do not loop around deref_tag()

 Code clean-up.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/fetch-prune-doc (2016-06-14) 1 commit
 - fetch: document that pruning happens before fetching

 Will merge to 'next'.


* km/fetch-do-not-free-remote-name (2016-06-14) 1 commit
 - builtin/fetch.c: don't free remote->name after fetch

 Will merge to 'next'.


* nb/gnome-keyring-build (2016-06-14) 1 commit
 - gnome-keyring: Don't hard-code pkg-config executable

 Build improvements for gnome-keyring (in contrib/)

 Will merge to 'next'.


* pb/strbuf-read-file-doc (2016-06-14) 1 commit
 - strbuf: describe the return value of strbuf_read_file

 Will merge to 'next'.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

 - bisect: make algorithm behavior independent of DEBUG_BISECT
 - bisect: make bisect compile if DEBUG_BISECT is set
 - bisect: plug the biggest memory leak
 - bisect: add test for the bisect algorithm
 - t6030: generalize test to not rely on current implementation
 - t: use test_cmp_rev() where appropriate
 - t/test-lib-functions.sh: generalize test_cmp_rev
 - bisect: allow 'bisect run' if no good commit is known
 - bisect: write about `bisect next` in documentation

 The internal algorithm used in "git bisect" to find the next commit
 to check has been optimized greatly.

 Expecting a reroll.

 ($gmane/287839)


* az/p4-bare-no-rebase (2016-02-19) 1 commit
 - git-p4.py: Don't try to rebase on submit from bare repository

 "git p4 submit" attempts to do a rebase, which would fail if done
 in a bare repository.  Not doing this rebase would paper over the
 failure, which is what this patch does, but it is unclear what the
 side effect of not rebasing is.

 Needs a better explanation.


* nd/icase (2016-02-15) 12 commits
 - grep.c: reuse "icase" variable
 - diffcore-pickaxe: support case insensitive match on non-ascii
 - diffcore-pickaxe: "share" regex error handling code
 - grep/pcre: support utf-8
 - gettext: add is_utf8_locale()
 - grep/pcre: prepare locale-dependent tables for icase matching
 - grep/icase: avoid kwsset when -F is specified
 - grep/icase: avoid kwsset on literal non-ascii strings
 - test-regex: expose full regcomp() to the command line
 - test-regex: isolate the bug test code
 - grep: break down an "if" stmt in preparation for next changes
 - grep: allow -F -i combination

 "git grep -i" has been taught to fold case in non-ascii locales.

 Needs review.
 ($gmane/286137)


* ec/annotate-deleted (2015-11-20) 1 commit
 - annotate: skip checking working tree if a revision is provided

 Usability fix for annotate-specific "<file> <rev>" syntax with deleted
 files.

 Waiting for review.


* dg/subtree-rebase-test (2016-01-19) 1 commit
 - contrib/subtree: Add a test for subtree rebase that loses commits

 Reviewed up to v5.
 Will be rerolled.
 ($gmane/284426)


* js/am-3-merge-recursive-direct (2015-10-12) 2 commits
 - am: make a direct call to merge_recursive
 - merge_recursive_options: introduce the "gently" flag

 The merge_recursive_generic() function has been made a bit safer to
 call from inside a process.  "git am -3" was taught to make a direct
 call to the function when falling back to three-way merge.

 Being able to make a direct call would be good in general, but as a
 performance thing, the change needs to be backed up by numbers.

 I haven't gone through the "gently" change with fine toothed comb;
 I can see that the change avoids calling die(), but I haven't made
 sure that the program states (e.g. what's in the in-core index) are
 adjusted sensibly when it returns to the caller instead of dying,
 or the codepaths that used to die() are free of resource leaks.
 The original code certainly did not care the program states at the
 point of dying exactly because it knew it is going to exit, but now
 they have to care, and they need to be audited.

 Will be rerolled.
 ($gmane/292205)


* dk/gc-more-wo-pack (2016-01-13) 4 commits
 - gc: clean garbage .bitmap files from pack dir
 - t5304: ensure non-garbage files are not deleted
 - t5304: test .bitmap garbage files
 - prepare_packed_git(): find more garbage

 Follow-on to dk/gc-idx-wo-pack topic, to clean up stale
 .bitmap and .keep files.

 Waiting for a reroll.
 ($gmane/284368).


* jc/diff-b-m (2015-02-23) 5 commits
 . WIPWIP
 . WIP: diff-b-m
 - diffcore-rename: allow easier debugging
 - diffcore-rename.c: add locate_rename_src()
 - diffcore-break: allow debugging

 "git diff -B -M" produced incorrect patch when the postimage of a
 completely rewritten file is similar to the preimage of a removed
 file; such a resulting file must not be expressed as a rename from
 other place.

 The fix in this patch is broken, unfortunately.
 Will discard.


* jc/merge-impossible-no-commit (2016-04-26) 2 commits
 - merge: warn --no-commit merge when no new commit is created
 - merge: do not contaminate option_commit with --squash

 "git merge --no-commit" silently succeeded when there is no need to
 create any commit, either when you are more recent than the commit
 you tried to merge, or you can fast-forward to the commit you tried
 to merge.  The command gives a warning message in such cases.

 Just tying loose ends in a discussion.  Unless somebody else
 champions this topic, I'll drop it.

 Will discard.

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* nd/shallow-deepen (2016-06-13) 27 commits
 - fetch, upload-pack: --deepen=N extends shallow boundary by N commits
 - upload-pack: add get_reachable_list()
 - upload-pack: split check_unreachable() in two, prep for get_reachable_list()
 - t5500, t5539: tests for shallow depth excluding a ref
 - clone: define shallow clone boundary with --shallow-exclude
 - fetch: define shallow boundary with --shallow-exclude
 - upload-pack: support define shallow boundary by excluding revisions
 - refs: add expand_ref()
 - t5500, t5539: tests for shallow depth since a specific date
 - clone: define shallow clone boundary based on time with --shallow-since
 - fetch: define shallow boundary with --shallow-since
 - upload-pack: add deepen-since to cut shallow repos based on time
 - shallow.c: implement a generic shallow boundary finder based on rev-list
 - fetch-pack: use a separate flag for fetch in deepening mode
 - fetch-pack.c: mark strings for translating
 - fetch-pack: use a common function for verbose printing
 - fetch-pack: use skip_prefix() instead of starts_with()
 - upload-pack: move rev-list code out of check_non_tip()
 - upload-pack: make check_non_tip() clean things up on error
 - upload-pack: tighten number parsing at "deepen" lines
 - upload-pack: use skip_prefix() instead of starts_with()
 - upload-pack: move "unshallow" sending code out of deepen()
 - upload-pack: remove unused variable "backup"
 - upload-pack: move "shallow" sending code out of deepen()
 - upload-pack: move shallow deepen code out of receive_needs()
 - transport-helper.c: refactor set_helper_option()
 - remote-curl.c: convert fetch_git() to use argv_array

 The existing "git fetch --depth=<n>" option was hard to use
 correctly when making the history of an existing shallow clone
 deeper.  A new option, "--deepen=<n>", has been added to make this
 easier to use.  "git clone" also learned "--shallow-since=<date>"
 and "--shallow-exclude=<tag>" options to make it easier to specify
 "I am interested only in the recent N months worth of history" and
 "Give me only the history since that version".

 Rerolled.


* jk/avoid-unbounded-alloca (2016-06-07) 1 commit
 - tree-diff: avoid alloca for large allocations

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/send-pack-stdio (2016-06-10) 2 commits

 Will merge to 'next'.


* pb/commit-editmsg-path (2016-06-09) 1 commit
 - builtin/commit.c: memoize git-path for COMMIT_EDITMSG

 Code clean-up.

 Will merge to 'next'.

  (merged to 'next' on 2016-06-06 at 536102f)
 + userdiff: add built-in pattern for CSS

 Update the funcname definition to support css files.

 Will merge to 'master' after 2.9 final.

 - attr.c: outline the future plans by heavily commenting
 - attr.c: always pass check[] to collect_some_attrs()
 - attr.c: introduce empty_attr_check_elems()
 - attr.c: correct ugly hack for git_all_attrs()
 - attr.c: rename a local variable check
 - fixup! d5ad6c13
 - attr.c: pass struct git_attr_check down the callchain
 - attr.c: add push_stack() helper
 (this branch uses jc/attr; is tangled with sb/pathspec-label and sb/submodule-default-paths.)

 The beginning of long and tortuous journey to clean-up attribute
 subsystem implementation.


* jk/rev-list-count-with-bitmap (2016-06-03) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-06-06 at dd9b30f)
 + rev-list: disable bitmaps when "-n" is used with listing objects
 + rev-list: "adjust" results of "--count --use-bitmap-index -n"

 "git rev-list --count" whose walk-length is limited with "-n"
 option did not work well with the counting optimized to look at the
 bitmap index.

 Will merge to 'master' after 2.9 final.


* mh/ref-iterators (2016-06-03) 13 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-06-06 at c8e79dc)
 + for_each_reflog(): reimplement using iterators
 + dir_iterator: new API for iterating over a directory tree
 + for_each_reflog(): don't abort for bad references

 + refs: remove unnecessary "extern" keywords
 (this branch is used by mh/ref-store; uses mh/split-under-lock; is tangled with mh/update-ref-errors.)

 The API to iterate over all the refs (i.e. for_each_ref(), etc.)
 has been revamped.

 Will merge to 'master' after 2.9 final.


* ew/mboxrd-format-am (2016-06-06) 3 commits
 - am: support --patch-format=mboxrd
 - mailsplit: support unescaping mboxrd messages
 - pretty: support "mboxrd" output format

 Teach format-patch and mailsplit (hence "am") how a line that
 happens to begin with "From " in the e-mail message is quoted with
 ">", so that these lines can be restored to their original shape.


* lf/receive-pack-auto-gc-to-client (2016-06-06) 1 commit
 - receive-pack: send auto-gc output over sideband 2

 Allow messages that are generated by auto gc during "git push" on
 the receiving end to be explicitly passed back to the sending end
 over sideband, so that they are shown with "remote: " prefix to
 avoid confusing the users.


* mg/cherry-pick-multi-on-unborn (2016-06-06) 1 commit
 - cherry-pick: allow to pick to unborn branches

 "git cherry-pick A" worked on an unborn branch, but "git
 cherry-pick A..B" didn't.


* mj/log-show-signature-conf (2016-06-06) 2 commits
 - log: "--no-show-signature" commmand-line option
 - log: add "log.showsignature" configuration variable

 "git log" learns log.showSignature configuration variable, and a
 command line option "--no-show-signature" to countermand it.

 The order of the commits in the topic need to be reversed.


* nd/i-t-a-commitable (2016-06-06) 3 commits
 - commit: don't count i-t-a entries when checking if the new commit is empty
 - Resurrect "diff-lib.c: adjust position of i-t-a entries in diff"
 - diff.h: extend "flags" field to 64 bits because we're out of bits

 "rm .git/index && git add -N * && git commit" allows you to create
 an empty commit without --allow-empty; attempt to forbid it.

 Breaks many tests by completely butchering "git commit", it seems.


* sg/reflog-past-root (2016-06-06) 1 commit
 - reflog: continue walking the reflog past root commits

 "git reflog" stopped upon seeing an entry that denotes a branch
 creation event (aka "unborn"), which made it appear as if the
 reflog was truncated.


* tb/complete-status (2016-06-10) 3 commits
 - completion: add git status
 - completion: add __git_get_option_value helper
 - completion: factor out untracked file modes into a variable

 The completion script (in contrib/) learned to complete "git
 status" options.


* tr/doc-tt (2016-06-08) 4 commits
 - doc: change configuration variables format
 - doc: more consistency in environment variables format
 - doc: change environment variables format
 - doc: clearer rule about formatting literals

 The documentation set has been updated so that literal commands,
 configuration variables and environment variables are consistently
 typeset in fixed-width font and bold in manpages.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* vs/prompt-avoid-unset-variable (2016-06-06) 1 commit
 - git-prompt.sh: Don't error on null ${ZSH,BASH}_VERSION, $short_sha

 The git-prompt scriptlet (in contrib/) was not friendly with those
 who uses "set -u", which has been fixed.


* rj/compat-regex-size-max-fix (2016-06-06) 1 commit
 - regex: fix a SIZE_MAX macro redefinition warning

 A compilation fix.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* bc/cocci-object-id (2016-06-06) 8 commits
 - merge-recursive: convert merge_recursive_generic to object_id
 - merge-recursive: convert leaf functions to use struct object_id
 - merge-recursive: convert struct merge_file_info to object_id
 - merge-recursive: convert struct stage_data to use object_id
 - Rename struct diff_filespec's sha1_valid member.
 - Convert struct diff_filespec to struct object_id
 - Apply standard object_id Coccinelle transformations.
 - Add basic Coccinelle transforms.

 Move from "unsigned char [20]" to "struct object_id" continues,
 with help from an automated tool.


* et/add-chmod-x (2016-06-07) 1 commit
 - add: add --chmod=+x / --chmod=-x options

 "git update-index --add --chmod=+x file" may be usable as an escape
 hatch, but not a friendly thing to force for people who do need to
 use it regularly.  "git add --chmod=+x file" can be used instead.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* mh/connect (2016-06-06) 10 commits
 - connect: [host:port] is legacy for ssh
 - connect: move ssh command line preparation to a separate function
 - connect: actively reject git:// urls with a user part
 - connect: change the --diag-url output to separate user and host
 - connect: make parse_connect_url() return the user part of the url as a separate value
 - connect: group CONNECT_DIAG_URL handling code
 - connect: make parse_connect_url() return separated host and port
 - connect: re-derive a host:port string from the separate host and port variables
 - connect: call get_host_and_port() earlier
 - connect: document why we sometimes call get_port after get_host_and_port

 Ok, folks, is everybody happy with this version?


* aq/upload-pack-use-parse-options (2016-05-31) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-06-06 at 505f1ee)
 + upload-pack.c: use parse-options API

 "git upload-pack" command has been updated to use the parse-options
 API.

 Will merge to 'master' after 2.9 final.


* jc/clear-pathspec (2016-06-02) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-06-06 at 9e7e291)
 + pathspec: rename free_pathspec() to clear_pathspec()

 We usually call a function that clears the contents a data
 structure X without freeing the structure itself clear_X(), and
 call a function that does clear_X() and also frees it free_X().
 free_pathspec() function has been renamed to clear_pathspec()
 to avoid confusion.

 Will merge to 'master' after 2.9 final.


* sb/submodule-recommend-shallowness (2016-05-27) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-05-31 at 1ee161c)
 + submodule update: learn `--[no-]recommend-shallow` option
 + submodule-config: keep shallow recommendation around
 (this branch is used by sb/submodule-clone-retry.)

 An upstream project can make a recommendation to make only a
 shallow clone for some submodules in the .gitmodules file it ship.

 Will merge to 'master' after 2.9 final.


* tb/convert-peek-in-index (2016-06-07) 3 commits
 - correct ce_compare_data() in a middle of a merge
 - read-cache: factor out get_sha1_from_index() helper
 - convert: unify the "auto" handling of CRLF

 Needs review.

 - worktree.c: add is_worktree_locked()
 - worktree.c: add is_main_worktree()
 - worktree.c: add find_worktree()
 (this branch uses nd/worktree-cleanup-post-head-protection.)

 "git worktree prune" protected worktrees that are marked as
 "locked" by creating a file in a known location.  "git worktree"
 command learned a dedicated command pair to create and remoev such
 a file, so that the users do not have to do this with editor.

 Ok, folks, is everybody happy with this version?


* et/pretty-format-c-auto (2016-05-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-05-31 at 1e9c920)
 + format_commit_message: honor `color=auto` for `%C(auto)`

 %C(auto) in a custom format string that commands in `git log`
 family takes unconditionally turned the color on, ignoring
 --no-color or --color=auto with output not connected to a tty;
 this was corrected to make the format truly behave as "auto".

 Will merge to 'master' after 2.9 final.

 + daemon: enable SO_KEEPALIVE for all sockets

 When "git daemon" is run without --[init-]timeout specified, a
 connection from a client that silently goes offline can hang around
 for a long time, wasting resources.  The socket-level KEEPALIVE has
 been enabled to allow the OS to notice such failed connections.

  (merged to 'next' on 2016-06-02 at 0c2e335)
 + grep: -W: don't extend context to trailing empty lines
 + t7810: add test for grep -W and trailing empty context lines

 + xdiff: ignore empty lines before added functions with -W
 + xdiff: handle appended chunks better with -W
 + xdiff: factor out match_func_rec()
 + t4051: rewrite, add more tests

 "git show -W" (extend hunks to cover the entire function, delimited
 by lines that match the "funcname" pattern) used to show the entire
 file when a change added an entire function at the end of the file,
 which has been fixed.

 The "git apply" standalone program is being libified; this is the
 first step to move many state variables into a structure that can
 be explicitly (re)initialized to make the machinery callable more
 than once.

 The next step that moves some remaining state variables into the
 structure and turns die()s into an error return that propagates up
 to the caller is not queued yet but in flight.  It would be good to
 review the above first and give the remainder of the series a solid
 base to build on.

 Will hold.

 + pathspec: disable preload-index when attribute pathspec magic is in use

  (merged to 'next' on 2016-05-31 at e72b604)
 + pathspec: allow querying for attributes

 + pathspec: move long magic parsing out of prefix_pathspec
 + Documentation: fix a typo
 (this branch is used by sb/submodule-default-paths; uses jc/attr; is tangled with jc/attr-more.)

 The pathspec mechanism learned ":(attr:X)$pattern" pathspec magic
 to limit paths that match $pattern further by attribute settings.
 The preload-index mechanism is disabled when the new pathspec magic
 is in use (at least for now), because the attribute subsystem is
 not thread-ready.

 - send-email: detect and offer to skip backup files

 A careless invocation of "git send-email directory/" after editing
 0001-change.patch with an editor often ends up sending both
 0001-change.patch and its backup file, 0001-change.patch~, causing
 embarrassment and a minor confusion.  Detect such an input and
 offer to skip the backup files when sending the patches out.
