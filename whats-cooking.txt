What's cooking in git.git (Feb 2019, #04; Sun, 24)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

Git 2.21 has been tagged and pushed out.

I'll be offline for a week, and will reopen the tree for the next
cycle in Asia/Tokyo timezone after that.  Some topics marked as
"Will cook in 'next'" will be merged to 'master' then.  This also is
a good week to nominate the topics that are already in 'next' but
should be kicked back to 'pu' to allow them to be replaced with a
better iteration, instead of piling ugly "oops, that was wrong"
fixes on top.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

* dl/submodule-set-branch (2019-02-08) 3 commits
 - submodule: teach set-branch subcommand
 - submodule--helper: teach config subcommand --unset
 - git-submodule.txt: "--branch <branch>" option defaults to 'master'

 "git submodule" learns "set-branch" subcommand that allows the
 submodule.*.branch settings to be modified.

 Need to attach sign-off; other than that it seems OK to be in 'next'.


* jc/test-yes-doc (2019-02-11) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-02-13 at cffac01759)

 "git prune-packed" did not notice and complain against excess
 arguments given from the command line, which now it does.

 Will cook in 'next'.

 Help developers by making it easier to run most of the tests under
 different versions of over-the-wire protocols.

 Blocked by js/protocol-advertise-multi


* dm/some-stdio-functions-are-macro-on-freebsd (2019-02-01) 1 commit
 - http: cast result to FILE *

 Variants of BSD define fileno(fh) as a macro, breaking a program
 that passes a "void *" to it.

 Expecting a reroll.

* en/combined-all-paths (2019-02-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-02-08 at 7057f38d6e)
 + log,diff-tree: add --combined-all-paths option

 Output from "diff --cc" did not show the original paths when the
 merge involved renames.  A new option adds the paths in the
 original trees to the output.

 Will cook in 'next'.

 - blame: add a config option to mark ignored lines
 - blame: add the ability to ignore commits and their changes
 - blame: use a helper function in blame_chunk()
 - Move init_skiplist() outside of fsck

 "git blame" learned to "ignore" commits in the history, whose
 effects (as well as their presence) get ignored.

 Needs update before merging to 'next'.


* nd/diff-parseopt (2019-01-27) 14 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-02-05 at 7c4b79aa79)
 + diff.c: convert --raw
 + diff.c: convert -W|--[no-]function-context
 + diff.c: convert -U|--unified
 + diff.c: convert -u|-p|--patch

 + parse-options.h: remove extern on function prototypes
 (this branch is used by nd/diff-parseopt-2.)

 The diff machinery, one of the oldest parts of the system, which
 long predates the parse-options API, uses fairly long and complex
 handcrafted option parser.  This is being rewritten to use the
 parse-options API.

 Will cook in 'next'.
 Looking good.


* sc/pack-redundant (2019-02-04) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-02-08 at ba3f8f0bc0)

 - setup: free old value before setting `work_tree`

 The setup code has been cleaned up to avoid leaks around the
 repository_format structure.

 cf. <20190124001450.GR423984@genre.crustytoothpaste.net>


* wh/author-committer-ident-config (2019-02-04) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-02-06 at 6ab8bfa199)

 Four new configuration variables {author,committer}.{name,email}
 have been introduced to override user.{name,email} in more specific

 Comments?


* tg/checkout-no-overlay (2019-02-04) 9 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-02-04 at 9968bcf4fb)

 + checkout: factor out mark_cache_entry_for_checkout function
 + checkout: clarify comment
 + read-cache: add invalidate parameter to remove_marked_cache_entries
 + entry: support CE_WT_REMOVE flag in checkout_entry
 + entry: factor out unlink_entry function
 + move worktree tests to t24*

 "git checkout --no-overlay" can be used to trigger a new mode of
 checking out paths out of the tree-ish, that allows paths that
 match the pathspec that are in the current index and working tree
 and are not in the tree-ish.

 Will hold.
 Waiting for "restore-files" & "switch-branches" pair.

 + merge: add scissors line on merge conflict
 + merge: cleanup messages like commit
 + t7600: clean up 'merge --squash c3 with c7' test
 + commit: extract cleanup_mode functions to sequencer

 The list of conflicted paths shown in the editor while concluding a
 conflicted merge was shown above the scissors line when the
 clean-up mode is set to "scissors", even though it was commented
 out just like the list of updated paths and other information to
 help the user explain the merge better.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* aw/pretty-trailers (2019-01-29) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-02-06 at b7e5437702)
 + pretty: add support for separator option in %(trailers)
 + strbuf: separate callback for strbuf_expand:ing literals
 + pretty: add support for "valueonly" option in %(trailers)
 + pretty: allow showing specific trailers
 + pretty: single return path in %(trailers) handling
 + pretty: allow %(trailers) options with explicit value
 + doc: group pretty-format.txt placeholders descriptions

 The %(trailers) formatter in "git log --format=..."  now allows to
 optionally pick trailers selectively by keyword, show only values,
 etc.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* jn/unknown-index-extensions (2018-11-21) 2 commits
 - index: offer advice for unknown index extensions
 - index: do not warn about unrecognized extensions

 A bit too alarming warning given when unknown index extensions
 exist is getting revamped.

 Expecting a reroll.


* dl/remote-save-to-push (2018-12-11) 1 commit
 - remote: add --save-to-push option to git remote set-url

 "git remote set-url" learned a new option that moves existing value
 of the URL field to pushURL field of the remote before replacing
 the URL field with a new value.

 I am personally not yet quite convinced if this is worth pursuing.


* js/protocol-advertise-multi (2018-12-28) 1 commit
 - protocol: advertise multiple supported versions
 (this branch is used by jt/test-protocol-version.)

 The transport layer has been updated so that the protocol version
 used can be negotiated between the parties, by the initiator
 listing the protocol versions it is willing to talk, and the other
 side choosing from one of them.

 Expecting a reroll.

* nb/branch-show-other-worktrees-head (2019-02-01) 3 commits
 - branch: add an extra verbose output displaying worktree path for refs checked out in a linked worktree
 - branch: mark and color a branch differently if it is checked out in a linked worktree
 - ref-filter: add worktreepath atom

 "git branch --list" learned to show branches that are checked out
 in other worktrees connected to the same repository prefixed with
 '+', similar to the way the currently checked out branch is shown
 with '*' in front.

 The top one probably deserves retitling.
 The second one is of dubious value.


* du/branch-show-current (2018-10-26) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-02-08 at e662ed4aee)
 + branch: introduce --show-current display option

 "git branch" learned a new subcommand "--show-current".

 Will cook in 'next'.


* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2018-10-15) 1 commit
 - zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".


* ag/sequencer-reduce-rewriting-todo (2019-01-29) 16 commits
 - rebase--interactive: move transform_todo_file() to rebase--interactive.c
 - sequencer: use edit_todo_list() in complete_action()
 - rebase-interactive: rewrite edit_todo_list() to handle the initial edit
 - rebase-interactive: append_todo_help() changes
 - rebase-interactive: use todo_list_write_to_file() in edit_todo_list()
 - sequencer: refactor skip_unnecessary_picks() to work on a todo_list
 - sequencer: change complete_action() to use the refactored functions
 - sequencer: make sequencer_make_script() write its script to a strbuf
 - sequencer: refactor rearrange_squash() to work on a todo_list
 - sequencer: refactor sequencer_add_exec_commands() to work on a todo_list
 - sequencer: refactor check_todo_list() to work on a todo_list
 - sequencer: introduce todo_list_write_to_file()
 - sequencer: refactor transform_todos() to work on a todo_list
 - sequencer: remove the 'arg' field from todo_item
 - sequencer: make the todo_list structure public
 - sequencer: changes in parse_insn_buffer()

 The scripted version of "git rebase -i" wrote and rewrote the todo
 list many times during a single step of its operation, and the
 recent C-rewrite made a faithful conversion of the logic to C.  The
 implementation has been updated to carry necessary information
 around in-core to avoid rewriting the same file over and over
 unnecessarily.

 Was still being worked on, but seems to have stalled.

* pw/add-p-select (2018-07-26) 4 commits
 - add -p: optimize line selection for short hunks
 - add -p: allow line selection to be inverted
 - add -p: select modified lines correctly
 - add -p: select individual hunk lines

 "git add -p" interactive interface learned to let users choose
 individual added/removed lines to be used in the operation, instead
 of accepting or rejecting a whole hunk.

 Will discard.
 No further feedbacks on the topic for quite some time.
