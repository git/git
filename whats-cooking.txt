What's cooking in git.git (Nov 2015, #04; Tue, 24)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.

Sorry for the extreme delay in pushing out my tree. I ended up busier
than I expected during the first week of Junio's absence, and then it
took me a while to dig myself out of the ever-filling hole of incoming
topics. :)

Expect quite a few new topics in this edition.  A number of them have
seen review already, and I'm planning to merge them to "next" fairly
quickly (I may do another integration cycle late tonight or tomorrow
with those changes).

I still have a few threads to comb through on the list. If you don't see
the latest version of your topic here, please feel free to ping me, or
to repost.

You can find the normal integration branches at:

    https://github.com/git/git/

and all topic branches at:

    https://github.com/peff/git/

But note that I will _not_ be pushing to kernel.org.

  (merged to 'next' on 2015-11-24 at 658a9c9)
 + http: treat config options sslCAPath and sslCAInfo as paths

 Allow tilde-expansion in some http config variables.

 Will merge to 'master'.

* mr/ff-refs (2015-11-24) 5 commits
 - ff-refs: Add tests
 - ff-refs: Add documentation
 - ff-refs: add --dry-run and --skip-worktree options
 - ff-refs: update each updatable ref
 - ff-refs: builtin cmd to check and fast forward local refs to their upstream

 Specialized command to fast-forward refs to match their upstream.

 I remain skeptical that this is necessary or sufficient. Comments
 welcome.

 Will hold.

 - rebase: fix preserving commits with --keep-empty
 - rebase: test broken behavior with --keep-empty

 Keep duplicate commits via rebase --keep-empty.

 I'm not sure if I agree with this interpretation of the "rebase
 --keep-empty" documentation, but I haven't thought too hard about it.
 Comments welcome.

 Waiting for review.


* rm/subtree-unwrap-tags (2015-11-24) 1 commit
 - contrib/subtree: unwrap tag refs

 Waiting for review from subtree folks.


* sg/bash-prompt-dirty-orphan (2015-11-24) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-11-24 at ac6eb1c)

 - sh-setup: make require_clean_work_tree() work on orphan branches
 - Add tests for git-sh-setup's require_clean_work_tree()

 Allow users of git-sh-setup to handle orphan branch state.

 This series takes the conservative route of requiring scripts to opt
 into the looser behavior, at the expense of carrying around a new
 option-flag forever. I'm not sure if we need to do so. Comments
 welcome.

 Will merge to 'next' in a few days.


* tb/ls-files-eol (2015-11-24) 1 commit
 - ls-files: Add eol diagnostics

 Add options to ls-files to help diagnose end-of-line problems.

 Paths that have been told the index about with "add -N" are not yet
 in the index, but various commands behaved as if they already are.

 Some commits need better explanation.

 Waiting for a reroll.

 . WIPWIP
 . WIP: diff-b-m
 - diffcore-rename: allow easier debugging
 - diffcore-rename.c: add locate_rename_src()
 - diffcore-break: allow debugging

 "git diff -B -M" produced incorrect patch when the postimage of a
 completely rewritten file is similar to the preimage of a removed
 file; such a resulting file must not be expressed as a rename from
 other place.

 The fix in this patch is broken, unfortunately.

* vl/grep-configurable-threads (2015-11-01) 1 commit
 - grep: add --threads=<num> option and grep.threads configuration

* kf/http-proxy-auth-methods (2015-11-04) 3 commits
 . SQUASH???
 . http: use credential API to handle proxy authentication
 . http: allow selection of proxy authentication method

 New http.proxyAuthMethod configuration variable can be used to
 specify what authentication method to use, as a way to work around
 proxies that do not give error response expected by libcurl when
 CURLAUTH_ANY is used.  Also, the codepath for proxy authentication
 has been taught to use credential API to store the authentication
 material in user's keyrings.

 I ejected this from pu for the moment, as it conflicts with the
 pt/http-socks-proxy topic.

 Still being worked on.
 ($gmane/280925).

 (this branch is tangled with sb/submodule-parallel-fetch.)

 Builds on top of the "fetch --recurse-submodules" work to introduce
 parallel downloading into multiple submodules for "submodule update".

 Waiting for sb/submodule-parallel-fetch to stabilize.

 It would be the cleanest to rebuild sb/submodule-parallel-fetch on
 top of 2.7.0 once it ships and then build this directly on top;
 that way, we do not have to have merges in this topic that
 distracting (besides, some part of the other topic can be updated
 in-place instead of this follow-up topic tweaking them as past
 mistakes and inflexibilities).

 I picked up v4 from the list, but it needs review.

 Teach codepaths that communicate with users by reading text files
 to be more lenient to editors that write CRLF-terminated lines.
 Note that this is only about communication with Git, like feeding
 list of object names from the standard input instead of from the
 command line, and does not involve files in the working tree.

* mh/notes-allow-reading-treeish (2015-10-08) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-10-23 at 8a697f0)
 + notes: allow treeish expressions as notes ref
 + Merge branch 'jk/notes-dwim-doc' into next
 + Merge branch 'jc/merge-drop-old-syntax' into next
 (this branch uses jc/merge-drop-old-syntax.)

 Some "git notes" operations, e.g. "git log --notes=<note>", should
 be able to read notes from any tree-ish that is shaped like a notes
 tree, but the notes infrastructure required that the argument must
 be a ref under refs/notes/.  Loosen it to require a valid ref only
 when the operation would update the notes (in which case we must
 have a place to store the updated notes tree, iow, a ref).

 As the patch was done on top of the 'drop old-syntax from merge',
 this has to wait until that other topic can graduate, unfortunately.
 It can be redone in a way that does not depend on that topic after
 this cycle, though.

 Will keep in 'next'.


* jc/mailinfo (2015-10-21) 1 commit
 - mailinfo: ignore in-body header that we do not care about

 Some people write arbitrary garbage at the beginning of a piece of
 e-mail (or after -- >8 -- scissors -- >8 -- line) in the commit log
 message and expect them to be discarded, even though "From:" and
 "Subject:" are the only documented in-body headers that you are
 supposed to have there.  Allow some garbage (specifically, what may
 look like RFC2822 headers like "MIME-Version: ...") to be there and
 ignore them.

 I have a feeling that that this is a step in a wrong direction.
 Comments?


* js/am-3-merge-recursive-direct (2015-10-12) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-10-23 at dc631e5)
 + am: make a direct call to merge_recursive
 + merge_recursive_options: introduce the "gently" flag

 The merge_recursive_generic() function has been made a bit safer to
 call from inside a process.  "git am -3" was taught to make a direct
 call to the function when falling back to three-way merge.

 Being able to make a direct call would be good in general, but as a
 performance thing, we would want to see it backed up by numbers.

 I haven't gone through the "gently" change with fine toothed comb;
 I can see that the change avoids calling die(), but I haven't made
 sure that the program states (e.g. what's in the in-core index) are
 adjusted sensibly when it returns to the caller instead of dying,
 or the codepaths that used to die() are free of resource leaks.
 The original code certainly did not care the program states at the
 point of dying exactly because it knew it is going to exit, but now
 they have to care, and they need to be audited.

 Will keep in 'next'.


* sg/pretty-more-date-mode-format (2015-10-07) 1 commit
 - pretty: add format specifiers for short and raw date formats

* jk/graph-format-padding (2015-09-14) 1 commit
 - pretty: pass graph width to pretty formatting for use in '%>|(N)'

 Redefine the way '%>|(N)' padding and the "--graph" option
 interacts.  It has been that the available columns to display the
 log message was measured from the edge of the area the graph ended,
 but with this it becomes the beginning of the entire output.

 I have a suspicion that 50% of the users would appreciate this
 change, and the remainder see this break their expectation.  If
 that is the case, we might need to introduce a similar but
 different alignment operator so that this new behaviour is
 available to those who want to use it, without negatively affecting
 existing uses.

 Undecided.

 (this branch is tangled with sb/submodule-parallel-update.)

 Add a framework to spawn a group of processes in parallel, and use
 it to run "git fetch --recurse-submodules" in parallel.

 Is everybody happy with the topic commit?

 Will cook in 'next'.

 Will hold.

* jc/rerere-multi (2015-09-14) 7 commits
 - rerere: do use multiple variants
 - t4200: rerere a merge with two identical conflicts
 - rerere: allow multiple variants to exist
 - rerere: delay the recording of preimage
 - rerere: handle leftover rr-cache/$ID directory and postimage files
 - rerere: scan $GIT_DIR/rr-cache/$ID when instantiating a rerere_id
 - rerere: split conflict ID further

 "git rerere" can encounter two or more files with the same conflict
 signature that have to be resolved in different ways, but there was
 no way to record these separate resolutions.


* jc/merge-drop-old-syntax (2015-04-29) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-10-07 at 50fed71)
 + merge: drop 'git merge <message> HEAD <commit>' syntax
 (this branch is used by mh/notes-allow-reading-treeish.)

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2015-05-28

 Stop supporting "git merge <message> HEAD <commit>" syntax that has
 been deprecated since October 2007.  It has been reported that
 git-gui still uses the deprecated syntax, which needs to be fixed
 before this final step can proceed.

 Will keep in 'next'.
