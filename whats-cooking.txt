What's cooking in git.git (Mar 2013, #06; Thu, 21)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.

Quite a few topics have graduated to 'master'; they were all cooking
in 'next' during the feature-freeze from the previous cycle.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

[Graduated to "master"]

* ap/maint-update-index-h-is-for-help (2013-02-23) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-19 at 1d7d180)
 + update-index: allow "-h" to also display options

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-02-25

 "git update-index -h" did not do the usual "-h(elp)" thing.


* bc/commit-complete-lines-given-via-m-option (2013-02-19) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-19 at 1609f9d)
 + Documentation/git-commit.txt: rework the --cleanup section
 + git-commit: only append a newline to -m mesg if necessary
 + t7502: demonstrate breakage with a commit message with trailing newlines
 + t/t7502: compare entire commit message with what was expected

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-02-19

 'git commit -m "$str"' when $str was already terminated with a LF
 now avoids adding an extra LF to the message.


* da/difftool-fixes (2013-02-21) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-19 at ffcb23f)
 + t7800: "defaults" is no longer a builtin tool name
 + t7800: modernize tests
 + t7800: update copyright notice
 + difftool: silence uninitialized variable warning

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-02-25

 Minor maintenance updates to difftool, and updates to its tests.

* gp/avoid-explicit-mention-of-dot-git-refs (2013-02-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-02-26 at ec42d98)
 + Fix ".git/refs" stragglers

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-02-26


* gp/describe-match-uses-glob-pattern (2013-02-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-02-26 at c9cc789)
 + describe: Document --match pattern format

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-02-26


* jc/color-diff-doc (2013-02-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-02-25 at c37541c)
 + diff-options: unconfuse description of --color

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-02-25


* jc/fetch-raw-sha1 (2013-02-07) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-19 at d5363f6)
 + fetch: fetch objects by their exact SHA-1 object names
 + upload-pack: optionally allow fetching from the tips of hidden refs
 + fetch: use struct ref to represent refs to be fetched
 + parse_fetch_refspec(): clarify the codeflow a bit

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-02-14

 Allows requests to fetch objects at any tip of refs (including
 hidden ones).  It seems that there may be use cases even outside
 Gerrit (e.g. $gmane/215701).


* jc/maint-push-refspec-default-doc (2013-03-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-19 at 0b2fa41)
 + Documentation/git-push: clarify the description of defaults

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-03-14

 Clarify in the documentation "what" gets pushed to "where" when the
 command line to "git push" does not say these explicitly.


* jc/perl-cat-blob (2013-02-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-19 at ad3aae3)
 + Git.pm: fix cat_blob crashes on large files

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-02-25

 perl/Git.pm::cat_blob slurped everything in core only to write it
 out to a file descriptor, which was not a very smart thing to do.


* jk/graph-c-expose-symbols-for-cgit (2013-03-03) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-04 at be35b12)
 + Revert "graph.c: mark private file-scope symbols as static"

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-03-04

 In the v1.8.0 era, we changed symbols that do not have to be global
 to file scope static, but a few functions in graph.c were used by
 CGit from sideways bypassing the entry points of the API the
 in-tree users use.


* jk/mailsplit-maildir-muttsort (2013-03-02) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-19 at 26f457c)
 + mailsplit: sort maildir filenames more cleverly

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-03-03

 Sort filenames read from the maildir/ in a way that is more likely
 to sort messages in the order the writing MUA meant to, by sorting
 numeric segment in numeric order and non-numeric segment in
 alphabetical order.


* jk/utf-8-can-be-spelled-differently (2013-02-25) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-19 at 18ebb43)
 + utf8: accept alternate spellings of UTF-8

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-02-26

 Some platforms and users spell UTF-8 differently; retry with the
 most official "UTF-8" when the system does not understand the
 user-supplied encoding name that are the common alternative
 spellings of UTF-8.


* jn/shell-disable-interactive (2013-03-09) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-19 at 4696604)
 + shell: new no-interactive-login command to print a custom message
 + shell doc: emphasize purpose and security model

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-03-14

 When the interactive access to git-shell is not enabled, we issue a
 message meant to help the system admininstrator to enable it. Add
 an explicit way to help the end users who connect to the service by
 issuing custom messages to refuse such an access.


* lf/bundle-verify-list-prereqs (2013-03-08) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-08 at 9e55d6d)
 + bundle: Add colons to list headings in "verify"
 + bundle: Fix "verify" output if history is complete

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-03-08


* mg/gpg-interface-using-status (2013-02-14) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-19 at bd54c7a)
 + pretty: make %GK output the signing key for signed commits
 + pretty: parse the gpg status lines rather than the output
 + gpg_interface: allow to request status return
 + log-tree: rely upon the check in the gpg_interface
 + gpg-interface: check good signature in a reliable way

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-02-26

 Call "gpg" using the right API when validating the signature on
 tags.


* mn/send-email-works-with-credential (2013-02-27) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-19 at 2daad63)
 + git-send-email: use git credential to obtain password
 + Git.pm: add interface for git credential command
 + Git.pm: allow pipes to be closed prior to calling command_close_bidi_pipe
 + Git.pm: refactor command_close_bidi_pipe to use _cmd_close
 + Git.pm: fix example in command_close_bidi_pipe documentation
 + Git.pm: allow command_close_bidi_pipe to be called as method

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-02-27

 Hooks the credential system to send-email.


* nd/branch-error-cases (2013-02-23) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-19 at 17834dd)
 + branch: segfault fixes and validation

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-02-25

 "git branch" had more cases where it did not bother to check
 nonsense command line parameters.


* nd/count-garbage (2013-02-15) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-19 at cf6fa47)
 + count-objects: report how much disk space taken by garbage files
 + count-objects: report garbage files in pack directory too
 + sha1_file: reorder code in prepare_packed_git_one()
 + git-count-objects.txt: describe each line in -v output

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-02-17

 "git count-objects -v" did not count leftover temporary packfiles
 and other kinds of garbage.


* nd/doc-index-format (2013-02-23) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-02-26 at 4d3caea)
 + update-index: list supported idx versions and their features
 + read-cache.c: use INDEX_FORMAT_{LB,UB} in verify_hdr()
 + index-format.txt: mention of v4 is missing in some places

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-02-26

 Update the index format documentation to mention the v4 format.


* nd/index-pack-l10n-buf-overflow (2013-03-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-19 at 01f0223)
 + index-pack: fix buffer overflow caused by translations

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-03-18


* nd/preallocate-hash (2013-03-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-19 at b92f720)
 + Preallocate hash tables when the number of inserts are known in advance

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-03-18

 When we know approximately how many entries we will have in the
 hash-table, it makes sense to size the hash table to that number
 from the beginning to avoid unnecessary rehashing.


* ob/imap-send-ssl-verify (2013-02-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-19 at 81aaed2)
 + imap-send: support Server Name Indication (RFC4366)

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-02-25

 Correctly connect to SSL/TLS sites that serve multiple hostnames on
 a single IP by including Server Name Indication in the client-hello.


* rj/msvc-build (2013-02-25) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-02-26 at 7493068)
 + msvc: avoid collisions between "tags" and "TAGS"
 + msvc: test-svn-fe: Fix linker "unresolved external" error
 + msvc: Fix build by adding missing symbol defines
 + msvc: git-daemon: Fix linker "unresolved external" errors

* rs/zip-compresssed-size-with-export-subst (2013-02-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-19 at 3d2ff88)
 + archive-zip: fix compressed size for stored export-subst files
 (this branch is used by rs/archive-zip-raw-compression.)

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-03-03

 When export-subst is used, "zip" output recorded incorrect
 size of the file.


* rt/commit-cleanup-config (2013-02-23) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-19 at 846cf01)
 + t7502: perform commits using alternate editor in a subshell

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-02-25

 Fix tests that contaminated their environments and affected new
 tests introduced later in the sequence by containing their effects
 in their own subshells.


* tb/document-status-u-tradeoff (2013-03-16) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-19 at 01573b6)
 + status: advise to consider use of -u when read_directory takes too long
 + git status: document trade-offs in choosing parameters to the -u option

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-03-18

 Suggest users to look into using--untracked=no option when "git
 status" takes too long.


* tk/doc-filter-branch (2013-02-26) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-02-26 at bd4638b)
 + Documentation: filter-branch env-filter example

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-02-26


* tz/credential-authinfo (2013-02-25) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-19 at 1a68953)
 + Add contrib/credentials/netrc with GPG support

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-02-27

 A new read-only credential helper (in contrib/) to interact with
 the .netrc/.authinfo files.  Hopefully mn/send-email-authinfo topic
 can rebuild on top of something like this.


* we/submodule-update-prefix-output (2013-03-03) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-19 at a818063)
 + submodule update: when using recursion, show full path

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-03-04

 "git submodule update", when recursed into sub-submodules, did not
 acccumulate the prefix paths.


* wk/doc-pre-rebase (2013-02-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-02-25 at a6ec310)

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-02-26

[New Topics]

* jc/merge-tag-object (2013-03-19) 1 commit
 - merge: a random object may not necssarily be a commit

 "git merge $(git rev-parse v1.8.2)" behaved quite differently from
 "git merge v1.8.2" as if v1.8.2 were written as v1.8.2^0 and did
 not pay much attention to the annotated tag payload.

 This makes the code notice the type of the tag object, in addition
 to the dwim_ref() based classification the current code uses
 (i.e. the name appears in refs/tags/) to decide when to special
 case merging of tags.

 We may actually want to call the current behaviour a feature,
 though.  After all, the user went to great length to feed something
 different from the normal "v1.8.2" to the command.


* jk/index-pack-correct-depth-fix (2013-03-20) 1 commit
 - index-pack: always zero-initialize object_entry list

 "index-pack --fix-thin" used uninitialize value to compute delta
 depths of objects it appends to the resulting pack.


* jn/push-tests (2013-03-19) 3 commits
 - push test: rely on &&-chaining instead of 'if bad; then echo Oops; fi'
 - push test: simplify check of push result
 - push test: use test_config when appropriate

 Update t5516 with style fixes.


* nd/index-pack-threaded-fixes (2013-03-19) 2 commits
 - index-pack: guard nr_resolved_deltas reads by lock
 - index-pack: protect deepest_delta in multithread code

 "index-pack --verify-stat" used a few counters outside protection
 of mutex, possibly showing incorrect numbers.


* kb/status-ignored-optim (2013-03-19) 8 commits
 - dir.c: git-status: avoid is_excluded checks for tracked files
 - dir.c: replace is_path_excluded with now equivalent is_excluded API
 - dir.c: unify is_excluded and is_path_excluded APIs
 - dir.c: move prep_exclude and factor out parts of last_exclude_matching
 - dir.c: git-status --ignored: don't list empty directories as ignored
 - dir.c: git-status --ignored: don't list empty ignored directories
 - dir.c: git-status --ignored: don't list files in ignored directories
 - dir.c: git-status --ignored: don't drop ignored directories

 "git status --ignored" had many corner case bugs.  Also the command
 has been optimized by taking advantage of the fact that paths that
 are already known to the index do not have to be checked against
 the .gitignore mechanism most of the time.

 Expecting a review from others; this codepath is used not only by
 status but also in add and clean, so a bug in it can result in lost
 data.


* rr/tests-dedup-test-config (2013-03-19) 1 commit
 - t4018,7810,7811: remove test_config() redefinition

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ja/directory-attrs (2013-03-20) 1 commit
 - trailing slash required in .gitattributes

 Expose but not fix a recent regression that started not matching a
 directory "sub" with gitattributes pattern "sub" (without trailing
 slash).


* jn/add-2.0-u-A-sans-pathspec (2013-03-20) 5 commits
 - git add: -u/-A now affects the entire working tree
 - add -A: only show pathless 'add -A' warning when changes exist outside cwd
 - add -u: only show pathless 'add -u' warning when changes exist outside cwd
 - add: make warn_pathless_add() a no-op after first call
 - add: make pathless 'add [-u|-A]' warning a file-global function

 Replaces jc/add-2.0-u-A-sans-pathspec topic by not warning against
 "add -u/-A" that is ran without pathspec when there is no change
 outside the current directory.


* rr/test-3200-style (2013-03-20) 1 commit
 - t3200 (branch): modernize style

 Churns.

 Will merge to 'next'.

* jc/format-patch (2013-02-21) 2 commits
 - format-patch: --inline-single
 - format-patch: rename "no_inline" field

 A new option to send a single patch to the standard output to be
 appended at the bottom of a message.  I personally have no need for
 this, but it was easy enough to cobble together.  Tests, docs and
 stripping out more MIMEy stuff are left as exercises to interested
 parties.

 Not ready for inclusion.

 - help doc: include --guide option description
 - help.c: add list_common_guides_help() function
 - help.c: add --guide option
 - help.c: use OPT_COUNTUP
 - show 'git help <guide>' usage, with examples

 Give more visibility to "concept guides" to help "git help" users.

 Expecting a reroll.

* hv/config-from-strbuf (2013-03-10) 4 commits
 - teach config parsing to read from strbuf

 - Teach get_default_remote to respect remote.default.
 - Test that plain "git fetch" uses remote.default when on a detached HEAD.
 - Teach clone to set remote.default.
 - Teach "git remote" about remote.default.
 - Teach remote.c about the remote.default configuration setting.
 - Rename remote.c's default_remote_name static variables.

 When the user does not specify what remote to interact with, we
 often attempt to use 'origin'.  This can now be customized via a
 configuration variable.

 Expecting a reroll.
 $gmane/210151

 "The first remote becomes the default" bit is better done as a
 separate step.

* ap/combine-diff-ignore-whitespace (2013-03-14) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-19 at dfb2c98)
 + Allow combined diff to ignore white-spaces

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-03-18

 Teach "diff --cc" output to honor options to ignore various forms
 of whitespace changes.

 Will merge to 'master' in the 4th batch (Safe).


* jk/checkout-attribute-lookup (2013-03-20) 3 commits

  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-19 at b063a55)
 + entry: fix filter lookup
 + t2003: modernize style

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-03-15

 Codepath to stream blob object contents directly from the object
 store to filesystem did not use the correct path to find conversion
 filters when writing to temporary files.

 Will merge to 'master' in the 4th batch (Safe).


* jk/difftool-dir-diff-edit-fix (2013-03-14) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-19 at e68014a)
 + difftool --dir-diff: symlink all files matching the working tree
 + difftool: avoid double slashes in symlink targets
 + git-difftool(1): fix formatting of --symlink description

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-03-15

 "git difftool --dir-diff" made symlinks to working tree files when
 preparing a temporary directory structure, so that accidental edits
 of these files in the difftool are reflected back to the working
 tree, but the logic to decide when to do so was not quite right.

 Will merge to 'master' in the 4th batch (Safe).


* lf/setup-prefix-pathspec (2013-03-14) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-19 at 0017e9e)
 + setup.c: check that the pathspec magic ends with ")"
 + setup.c: stop prefix_pathspec() from looping past the end of string

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-03-14

 "git cmd -- ':(top'" was not diagnosed as an invalid syntax, and
 instead the parser kept reading beyond the end of the string.

 Will merge to 'master' in the 3rd batch (Safe).


* jk/fully-peeled-packed-ref (2013-03-18) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-19 at fa92bc7)
 + pack-refs: add fully-peeled trait
 + pack-refs: write peeled entry for non-tags
 + use parse_object_or_die instead of die("bad object")
 + avoid segfaults on parse_object failure

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-03-18

 Not that we do not actively encourage having annotated tags outside
 refs/tags/ hierarchy, but they were not advertised correctly to the
 ls-remote and fetch with recent version of Git.

 Will merge to 'master' in the 3rd batch (Safe).


* jk/peel-ref (2013-03-16) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-03-19 at f0d4c16)

 + upload-pack: make sure "want" objects are parsed
 + upload-pack: drop lookup-before-parse optimization

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-03-18

 Recent optimization broke shallow clones.

 Will merge to 'master' in the 3rd batch (Safe).

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-03-05

 The "--match=<pattern>" option of "git describe", when used with
 "--all" to allow refs that are not annotated tags to be used as a
 base of description, did not restrict the output from the command
 to those that match the given pattern.

 We may want to have a looser matching that does not restrict to tags,
 but that can be done as a follow-up topic; this step is purely a bugfix.

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-03-05

 config.mak.in template had an "export" line to cause a few
 common makefile variables to be exported; if they need to be
 expoted for autoconf/configure users, they should also be exported
 for people who write config.mak the same way.  Move the "export" to
 the main Makefile.  Also, stop exporting mandir that used to be
 exported (only) when config.mak.autogen was used.  It would have
 broken installation of manpages (but not other documentation
 formats).

 "git status" has been optimized by taking advantage of the fact

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-03-14

 "git add -u/-A" without pathspec has traditonally limited its
 operation to the current directory and its subdirectories, but in
 Git 1.8.2 we started encouraging users to be more explicit to
 specify "." when they mean it (and use ":/" to make it affect the
 entire working tree).  With this, we finally change the behaviour
 and make it affect the entire working tree in Git 2.0.
