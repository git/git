What's cooking in git.git (Apr 2021, #04; Thu, 15)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'seen' (formerly 'pu'---proposed updates) while commits prefixed
with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

Release tarballs are available at:

[Graduated to 'master']

* ab/complete-cherry-pick-head (2021-04-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-04-09 at 5810d0e2c2)
 + bash completion: complete CHERRY_PICK_HEAD

 The command line completion (in contrib/) has learned that
 CHERRY_PICK_HEAD is a possible pseudo-ref.


* ab/detox-config-gettext (2021-04-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-04-08 at 01d6ff5069)
 + config.c: remove last remnant of GIT_TEST_GETTEXT_POISON

 The last remnant of gettext-poison has been removed.


* ab/perl-do-not-abuse-map (2021-04-02) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-04-03 at 4eaf558557)
 + git-send-email: replace "map" in void context with "for"
 (this branch is used by ab/send-email-validate-errors.)

 Perl critique.


* ab/send-email-validate-errors (2021-04-06) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-04-06 at d7fb1dbde0)
 + git-send-email: improve --validate error output
 + git-send-email: refactor duplicate $? checks into a function
 + git-send-email: test full --validate output
 (this branch uses ab/perl-do-not-abuse-map.)

 Clean-up codepaths that implements "git send-email --validate"
 option and improves the message from it.


* cc/test-helper-bloom-usage-fix (2021-04-05) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-04-06 at 4895f33fee)
 + test-bloom: fix missing 'bloom' from usage string

 Usage message fix for a test helper.


* fm/user-manual-use-preface (2021-04-03) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-04-05 at 0ae8f63207)
 + user-manual.txt: assign preface an id and a title

 Doc update to improve git.info


* gk/gitweb-redacted-email (2021-04-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-04-08 at 8a19c3cd6e)
 + gitweb: add "e-mail privacy" feature to redact e-mail addresses

 "gitweb" learned "e-mail privacy" feature to redact strings that
 look like e-mail addresses on various pages.


* jk/ref-filter-segfault-fix (2021-04-01) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-04-02 at 03596563b7)
 + ref-filter: fix NULL check for parse object failure

 A NULL-dereference bug has been corrected in an error codepath in
 "git for-each-ref", "git branch --list" etc.


* jz/apply-3way-cached (2021-04-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-04-09 at 7d1e84936f)
 + git-apply: allow simultaneous --cached and --3way options
 (this branch uses jz/apply-run-3way-first.)

 "git apply" now takes "--3way" and "--cached" at the same time, and
 work and record results only in the index.


* jz/apply-run-3way-first (2021-04-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-04-08 at f826bcc6b8)
 + git-apply: try threeway first when "--3way" is used
 (this branch is used by jz/apply-3way-cached.)

 "git apply --3way" has always been "to fall back to 3-way merge
 only when straight application fails". Swap the order of falling
 back so that 3-way is always attempted first (only when the option
 is given, of course) and then straight patch application is used as
 a fallback when it fails.


* tb/pack-preferred-tips-to-give-bitmap (2021-03-31) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-04-03 at cd7024ecd8)
 + builtin/pack-objects.c: respect 'pack.preferBitmapTips'
 + t/helper/test-bitmap.c: initial commit
 + pack-bitmap: add 'test_bitmap_commits()' helper
 (this branch is used by tb/multi-pack-bitmaps.)

 A configuration variable has been added to force tips of certain
 refs to be given a reachability bitmap.


* tb/precompose-prefix-simplify (2021-04-05) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-04-05 at 78e8ed11b7)
 + macOS: precompose startup_info->prefix
 + precompose_utf8: make precompose_string_if_needed() public

 Streamline the codepath to fix the UTF-8 encoding issues in the
 argv[] and the prefix on macOS.


* vs/completion-with-set-u (2021-04-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-04-08 at b9b8bde89d)
 + completion: audit and guard $GIT_* against unset use

 The command-line completion script (in contrib/) had a couple of
 references that would have given a warning under the "-u" (nounset)
 option.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* ab/detox-gettext-tests (2021-04-13) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-04-15 at db0da2903a)
 + tests: remove all uses of test_i18cmp

 Test clean-up.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 - fsck: report invalid object type-path combinations
 - fsck: report invalid types recorded in objects
 - object-store.h: move read_loose_object() below 'struct object_info'
 - fsck: don't hard die on invalid object types
 - fsck tests: refactor one test to use a sub-repo
 - cache.h: move object functions to object-store.h

 "git fsck" has been taught to report mismatch between expected and
 actual types of an object better.


* ab/usage-error-docs (2021-04-13) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-04-15 at dbbbaa5eea)
 + api docs: document that BUG() emits a trace2 error event
 + api docs: document BUG() in api-error-handling.txt
 + usage.c: don't copy/paste the same comment three times

 Documentation updates, with unrelated comment updates, too.

 Will merge to 'master'.

  (merged to 'next' on 2021-04-15 at 41f303ef9b)
 + revision: avoid parsing with --exclude-promisor-objects
 + lookup_unknown_object(): take a repository argument
 + is_promisor_object(): free tree buffer after parsing
 (this branch is used by rs/repack-without-loosening-promised-objects.)

 Handling of "promisor packs" that allows certain objects to be
 missing and lazily retrievable has been optimized (a bit).

 Will merge to 'master'.

 - doc/diff-options: document new --diff-merges features
 - diff-merges: introduce log.diffMerges config variable
 - diff-merges: adapt -m to enable default diff format
 - diff-merges: refactor set_diff_merges()

 "git log" learned "--diff-merges=<style>" option, with an
 associated configuration variable log.diffMerges.

 Seems to break t9902.


* rs/repack-without-loosening-promised-objects (2021-04-14) 2 commits
 - repack: avoid loosening promisor pack objects in partial clones
 - repack: teach --no-prune-packed to skip `git prune-packed`
 (this branch uses jk/promisor-optim.)

 "git repack -A -d" in a partial clone unnecessarily loosened
 objects in promisor pack.


* jc/doc-do-not-capitalize-clarification (2021-04-14) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-04-15 at 873f7a1f84)
 + doc: clarify "do not capitalize the first word" rule

 Doc update for developers.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* mt/pkt-write-errors (2021-04-15) 1 commit
 - pkt-line: do not report packet write errors twice

 When packet_write() fails, we gave an extra error message
 unnecessarily, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ow/push-quiet-set-upstream (2021-04-15) 1 commit
 - transport: respect verbosity when setting upstream

 "git push --quiet --set-upstream" was not quiet when setting the
 upstream branch configuration, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.

[Stalled]

* dl/complete-stash (2021-03-24) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-03-24 at ce573a99cc)
 + git-completion.bash: use __gitcomp_builtin() in _git_stash()
 + git-completion.bash: extract from else in _git_stash()
 + git-completion.bash: pass $__git_subcommand_idx from __git_main()

 Update "git stash branch<TAB>" command line completion (in contrib/).

 On hold.  Probably needs either a reroll or incremental refinements.

 - git-p4: do not decode data from perforce by default
 - git-p4: avoid decoding more data from perforce

 "git p4" in Python-2 days used to accept a lot more kinds of data
 from Perforce server as uninterrupted byte sequence, but after
 switching to Python-3, too many things are expected to be in UTF-8,
 which broke traditional use cases.

 Waiting for reviews.

 When "git pack-objects" makes a literal copy of a part of existing
 packfile using the reachability bitmaps, its update to the progress
 meter was broken.

 + config: allow overriding of global and system configuration
 + config: unify code paths to get global config paths
 + config: rename `git_etc_config()`

 Replace GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM mechanism to decline from reading the
 system-wide configuration file with GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM that lets
 users specify from which file to read the system-wide configuration
 (setting it to an empty file would essentially be the same as
 setting NOSYSTEM), and introduce GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL to override the
 per-user configuration in $HOME/.gitconfig.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ds/maintenance-prefetch-fix (2021-04-10) 3 commits
 - maintenance: use 'git fetch --prefetch'
 - fetch: add --prefetch option
 - maintenance: simplify prefetch logic

 The prefetch task in "git maintenance" assumed that "git fetch"
 from any remote would fetch all its local branches, which would
 fetch too much if the user is interested in only a subset of
 branches there.

 Expecting a reroll.

 - run-command: make `exists_in_PATH()` non-static

 The codepaths involved in running "git bisect visualize" and "git
 bisect run" has been rewritten in C.

 Expecting a reroll.

 - Makefile: add missing dependencies of 'config-list.h'

 The dependencies for config-list.h and command-list.h were broken
 when the former was split out of the latter, which has been
 corrected.

 Expecting a reroll.

 "git add" and "git rm" learned not to touch those paths that are
 outside of sparse checkout.

* zh/trailer-cmd (2021-04-12) 2 commits
 - trailer: add new .cmd config option
 - docs: correct descript of trailer.<token>.command

 The way the command line specified by the trailer.<token>.command
 configuration variable receives the end-user supplied value was
 both error prone and misleading.  An alternative to achieve the
 same goal in a safer and more intuitive way has been added, as
 the trailer.<token>.cmd configuration variable, to replace it.

 Waiting for reviews.
 I doubt it is a good idea to copy the "run once even without being
 asked" from .command interface.

 corresponds to the directory that contains them when the "cone"
 mode of sparse checkout is in use.

 On hold, waiting for the "protections" topic to stablize.
