What's cooking in git.git (Jun 2010, #04; Wed, 23)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones
marked with '.' do not appear in any of the integration branches, but I am
still holding onto them.

I think I should start making noises about feature freeze for 1.7.2 by
now.  'next' is getting quite thin (and most of them look good ones),
while topics in 'pu' are mostly the kind nobody gets hurt if we waited for
a cycle or two.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* ar/decorate-color (2010-06-23) 4 commits
 - Allow customizable commit decorations colors
 - log --decorate: Colorize commit decorations
 - log-tree.c: Use struct name_decoration's type for classifying decoration

* tc/checkout-B (2010-06-22) 3 commits
 - builtin/checkout: learn -B
 - builtin/checkout: change -b from an OPTION_STRING to a OPTION_SET_INT
 - add tests for checkout -b

  (merged to 'next' on 2010-06-17 at cb81c35)
 + branch: don't fail listing branches if one of the commits wasn't found
 + branch: exit status now reflects if branch listing finds an error

* tc/commit-abbrev-fix (2010-06-12) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-06-16 at b2df7f8)

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled -- would discard unless there are some movements soon]

* js/rebase-origin-x (2010-02-05) 1 commit
 - [RFC w/o test and incomplete] rebase: add -x option to record original commit name

I retract my objection against the idea of -x; needs polishing before
moving forward.

* ab/i18n (2010-06-15) 3 commits
 . Add initial C, Shell and Perl gettext translations
 . fixup! Add infrastructure
 . Add infrastructure for translating Git with gettext

The parts that touch other topics in flight probably need to be split into
separate patches; otherwise it is unmanageable.

* ab/tap (2010-06-15) 5 commits
 . TAP: Make sure there's a newline before "ok" under harness
 . TAP: Say "pass" rather than "ok" on an empty line
 . We use TAP so the Perl test can run without scaffolding
 . Skip tests in a way that makes sense under TAP
 . Make test-lib.sh emit valid TAP format

Updated with a newer round but it seems to break "make -j8 test" when
merged to 'pu', hence ejected.  I was not sure why TAP is worth the
trouble, and I still am not sure.

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* as/maint-completion-set-u-fix (2010-06-17) 1 commit
 - bash-completion: Fix __git_ps1 to work with "set -u"

Will merge to 'next'; seemed sane.

* zl/mailinfo-recode-patch (2010-06-14) 2 commits
 - add --recode-patch option to git-am
 - add --recode-patch option to git-mailinfo

Perhaps another round is coming?

* rr/svn-export (2010-06-10) 7 commits
 - Add LICENSE
 - Add SVN dump parser
 - Add infrastructure to write revisions in fast-export format
 - Add stream helper library
 - Add library for string-specific memory pool
 - Add cpp macro implementation of treaps
 - Add memory pool library

I recall there was another round of re-roll planned for this one.

* tr/rev-list-count (2010-06-17) 2 commits
 - bash completion: Support "divergence from upstream" messages in __git_ps1
 - rev-list: introduce --count option

I'd like an Ack/Nack on the tip one from people involved in the completion
scripts.

* tr/send-email-8bit (2010-06-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-06-23 at be75199)
 + send-email: ask about and declare 8bit mails

* jl/maint-diff-ignore-submodules (2010-06-08) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-06-23 at 057acb7)
 + Add optional parameters to the diff option "--ignore-submodules"
 + git diff: rename test that had a conflicting name

* cp/textconv-cat-file (2010-06-09) 4 commits
 - [DONTMERGE] git gui: use textconv filter for diff and blame
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-06-23 at eb6f216)
 + t/t8007: test textconv support for cat-file
 + textconv: support for cat_file
 + sha1_name: add get_sha1_with_context()
 (this branch uses ab/blame-textconv.)

I'd need to prod Shawn to take a look at the tip one, as I shouldn't be
applying it to my tree myself.

* ab/blame-textconv (2010-06-07) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-06-23 at a7da5af)
 + t/t8006: test textconv support for blame
 + textconv: support for blame
 + textconv: make the API public
 (this branch is used by cp/textconv-cat-file.)

* jn/grep-open (2010-06-21) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-06-22 at 8edca58)
 + t/t7811-grep-open.sh: remove broken/redundant creation of fake "less" script
 + t/t7811-grep-open.sh: ensure fake "less" is made executable
 + t/lib-pager.sh: remove unnecessary '^' from 'expr' regular expression
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-06-18 at cf96ea8)
 + grep -O: allow optional argument specifying the pager (or editor)
 + grep: Add the option '--open-files-in-pager'
 + Unify code paths of threaded greps
 + grep: refactor grep_objects loop into its own function

* pb/maint-perl-errmsg-no-dir (2010-06-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-06-23 at 990ea67)
 + Git.pm: better error message

* eb/double-convert-before-merge (2010-06-16) 1 commit
 - ll-merge: Normalize files before merging

If running git-to-worktree and then worktree-to-git _fixes_ something, it
means that these are not roundtrip operations; there is something that is
fundamentally wrong.  The commit log message doesn't help explaining it,
either.

* js/maint-am-rebase-invalid-author (2010-06-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-06-23 at b345ad5)
 + am: use get_author_ident_from_commit instead of mailinfo when rebasing

* ps/gitweb-soc (2010-06-02) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-06-13 at 92245ae)
 + git-instaweb: Add option to reuse previous config file
 + Makefile: Use $(sharedir)/gitweb for target 'install-gitweb'

If we are going to have a configuration variable to control this, I
strongly suspect that --reuse-config should be renamed so that the
variable can be named more sanely and in line with whatever option
that replaces it.

* cc/cherry-pick-stdin (2010-06-14) 3 commits
 - revert: do not rebuild argv on heap
 - revert: accept arbitrary rev-list options
 - t3508 (cherry-pick): futureproof against unmerged files

What's the doneness of this one?

* jn/show-num-walks (2010-06-01) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-06-23 at e61649c)
 + DWIM 'git show -5' to 'git show --do-walk -5'

* mg/rev-parse-lrbranches-locals (2010-05-14) 1 commit
 - revlist: Introduce --lrbranches and --locals revision specifiers
 (this branch uses mg/rev-parse-option-sifter-deprecation.)

I am reluctant to merge a patch that introduces an unpronounceable
option.

* mg/rev-parse-option-sifter-deprecation (2010-05-14) 3 commits
 - t6018: make sure all tested symbolic names are different revs
 - t6018: add tests for rev-list's --branches and --tags
 - rev-parse: deprecate use as an option sifter
 (this branch is used by mg/rev-parse-lrbranches-locals.)

I don't think these patches help anything.  Opinions?
