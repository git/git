What's cooking in git.git (Oct 2024, #08; Tue, 15)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and
aren't considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL
to a message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity (of course they can be resubmit when new interests
arise).

This is the first pushout from the interim maintainer. A handful of
topics which were marked as "Will merge to 'master'" have done so, and
'next' does not contain any new topics. I'll plan on doing another
integration cycle towards the end of this week that will graduate some
more topics to 'master', as well as add new topics to 'next'.

Please take a close look through the report below, and make sure that
the various integration branches look OK. I spent quite a bit of time
refreshing my memory on how Junio's scripts work, but there is still
room for error. If you see something that looks wrong, please let me
know.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-scm/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/

 On macOS, fsmonitor can fall into a race condition that results in
 a client waiting forever to be notified for an event that have
 already happened.  This problem has been corrected.

 . pack-bitmap: drop `from_midx` field from `bitmapped_pack`
 . pack-bitmap.c: extract `find_base_bitmap_pos()`

 . pack-bitmap.c: avoid unnecessary `offset_to_pack_pos()`
 . pack-bitmap.c: do not pass `pack_pos` to `try_partial_reuse()`

 Allow pack-objects to reuse an existing delta in a packfile, when
 it ends up sending the base object from a different packfile.

 - remote set-head: better output for --auto

 When "git fetch $remote" notices that refs/remotes/$remote/HEAD is
 missing and discovers what branch the other side points with its
 HEAD, refs/remotes/$remote/HEAD is updated to point to it.

 Needs to shed files backend dependency a bit more.

 - BreakingChanges: early adopter option

 Describe the policy to introduce breaking changes.

 Needs review.

* jc/strbuf-commented-something (2024-09-12) 2 commits
 - strbuf: retire strbuf_commented_lines()
 - strbuf: retire strbuf_commented_addf()

 Update two functions whose callers always pass the same global
 variable to omit the redundant parameter and use the global in the
 callee themselves.

 On hold.

* cc/promisor-remote-capability (2024-09-10) 4 commits
 - promisor-remote: check advertised name or URL
 - Add 'promisor-remote' capability to protocol v2
 - strbuf: refactor strbuf_trim_trailing_ch()
 - version: refactor strbuf_sanitize()

 The v2 protocol learned to allow the server to advertise possible
 promisor remotes, and the client to respond with what promissor
 remotes it uses, so that the server side can omit objects that the
 client can lazily obtain from these other promissor remotes.

 Comments?  I got an impression that this is premature without
 finishing the discussion on a larger picture.

* sj/ref-contents-check (2024-09-30) 9 commits
 - ref: add symlink ref content check for files backend
 - t0602: add ref content checks for worktrees
 - ref: enhance escape situation for worktrees
 - ref: add escape check for the referent of symref
 - ref: add basic symref content check for files backend
 - ref: add more strict checks for regular refs
 - ref: port git-fsck(1) regular refs check for files backend
 - builtin/refs: support multiple worktrees check for refs.
 - ref: initialize "fsck_ref_report" with zero

 "git fsck" learned to issue warnings on "curiously formatted" ref
 contents that have always been taken valid but something Git
 wouldn't have written itself (e.g., missing terminating end-of-line
 after the full object name).

 Needs review.
