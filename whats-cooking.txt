What's cooking in git.git (Oct 2020, #01; Mon, 5)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'seen' (formerly 'pu'---proposed updates) while commits prefixed
with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches of the
repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-29 at 7bbf508562)
 + completion: complete refs after 'git restore -s'
 + completion: use "prev" variable instead of introducing "prevword"

 The command line completion (in contrib/) learned that "git restore
 -s <TAB>" is often followed by a refname.


* cc/bisect-start-fix (2020-09-25) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-29 at 637011d04a)
 + bisect: don't use invalid oid as rev when starting

 "git bisect start X Y", when X and Y are not valid committish
 object names, should take X and Y as pathspec, but didn't.


* ds/in-merge-bases-many-optim-bug (2020-10-02) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-10-04 at b736873ada)
 + commit-reach: fix in_merge_bases_many bug
 (this branch is used by sk/force-if-includes.)

 in_merge_bases_many(), a way to see if a commit is reachable from
 any commit in a set of commits, was totally broken when the
 commit-graph feature was in use, which has been corrected.


* eg/mailinfo-doc-scissors (2020-09-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-29 at 4694f22fe9)
 + Doc: show example scissors line

* jc/blame-ignore-fix (2020-09-24) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-29 at 96fbdb57fb)
 + blame: validate and peel the object names on the ignore list
 + t8013: minimum preparatory clean-up

 "git blame --ignore-rev/--ignore-revs-file" failed to validate
 their input are valid revision, and failed to take into account
 that the user may want to give an annotated tag instead of a
 commit, which has been corrected.


* jc/fmt-merge-msg-suppress-destination (2020-09-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-29 at 2b1f8ee654)

  (merged to 'next' on 2020-10-04 at 637072574f)
 + combine-diff: handle --find-object in multitree code path

 "log -c --find-object=X" did not work well to find a merge that
 involves a change to an object X from only one parent.

  (merged to 'next' on 2020-10-04 at ab8f65b8c5)
 + format-patch: teach format.useAutoBase "whenAble" option

 "git format-patch" learns to take "whenAble" as a possible value
 for the format.useAutoBase configuration variable to become no-op
 when the  automatically computed base does not make sense.


* jk/refspecs-negative (2020-09-30) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-10-04 at 2948e90fab)
 + refspec: add support for negative refspecs

 Code cleanup.


* js/cmake-vs (2020-09-30) 10 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-10-01 at 40be8c6094)
 + hashmap_for_each_entry(): workaround MSVC's runtime check failure #3
 + cmake (Windows): recommend using Visual Studio's built-in CMake support

 + cmake: ensure that the `vcpkg` packages are found on Windows
 + cmake: do find Git for Windows' shell interpreter
 + cmake: ignore files generated by CMake as run in Visual Studio

 Using the CMake support we added some time ago for real with Visual
 Studio build revealed there were lot of usability improvements
 possible, which have been carried out.


* js/default-branch-name-part-2 (2020-09-26) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-30 at 3fb4047ce3)
 + t9902: avoid using the branch name `master`
 + tests: avoid variations of the `master` branch name
 + t3200: avoid variations of the `master` branch name

* js/no-builtins-on-disk-option (2020-09-21) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-25 at 6b976da4d2)
 + ci: stop linking built-ins to the dashed versions
 + Optionally skip linking/copying the built-ins
 + msvc: copy the correct `.pdb` files in the Makefile target `install`

 The installation procedure learned to optionally omit "git-foo"
 executable files for each 'foo' built-in subcommand, which are only
 required by old timers that still rely on the age old promise that
 prepending "git --exec-path" output to PATH early in their script
 will keep the "git-foo" calls they wrote working.

 The old attempt to remove these executables from the disk failed in
 the 1.6 era; it may be worth attempting again, but I think it is
 worth to keep this topic separate from such a policy change to help
 it graduate early.


* jt/keep-partial-clone-filter-upon-lazy-fetch (2020-09-28) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-10-01 at 77c4c6094c)
 + fetch: do not override partial clone filter
 + promisor-remote: remove unused variable

 The lazy fetching done internally to make missing objects available
 in a partial clone incorrectly made permanent damage to the partial
 clone filter in the repository, which has been corrected.


* ma/worktree-cleanups (2020-09-27) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-10-01 at 369dcfb161)

 + worktree: rename copy-pasted variable
 + worktree: update renamed variable in comment
 + worktree: inline `worktree_ref()` into its only caller
 + wt-status: introduce wt_status_state_free_buffers()
 + wt-status: print to s->fp, not stdout
 + wt-status: replace sha1 mentions with oid

 Code clean-up.


* mr/bisect-in-c-2 (2020-09-24) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-29 at a15f1729d2)
 + bisect--helper: reimplement `bisect_next` and `bisect_auto_next` shell functions in C
 + bisect: call 'clear_commit_marks_all()' in 'bisect_next_all()'

 + bisect--helper: introduce new `write_in_file()` function
 + bisect--helper: use '-res' in 'cmd_bisect__helper' return
 + bisect--helper: BUG() in cmd_*() on invalid subcommand

 Rewrite of the "git bisect" script in C continues.


* mt/delta-base-cache-races (2020-09-28) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-29 at ee2d60c077)
 + packfile: fix memory leak in add_delta_base_cache()
 + packfile: fix race condition on unpack_entry()

 A race that leads to an access to a free'd data was corrected in
 the codepath that reads pack files.


* nl/credential-crlf (2020-10-03) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-10-04 at 213256c1e6)

 Loosen the parser in the receiving end of the credential protocol
 to allow credential helper to terminate lines with CRLF line
 ending, as well as LF line ending.


* pb/submodule-doc-fix (2020-10-04) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-10-04 at c535486479)

 + config/uploadpack.txt: fix typo in `--filter=tree:<n>`

 Hotfix.


* td/submodule-update-quiet (2020-10-01) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-10-01 at 4ae8bee636)
 + submodule update: silence underlying merge/rebase with "--quiet"

 "git submodule update --quiet" did not squelch underlying "rebase"
 and "pull" commands.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* mk/diff-ignore-regex (2020-10-01) 2 commits
 - t: add -I<regex> tests
 - diff: add -I<regex> that ignores matching changes

 "git diff" family of commands learned the "-I<regex>" option to
 ignore hunks whose changed lines all match the given pattern.

 Expecting review response.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* ew/decline-core-abbrev (2020-09-01) 1 commit
 - core.abbrev <off|false|no> disables abbreviations

 Allow the configuration to specify no abbreviation regardless of
 the hash algorithm.

 Expecting a reroll.  The intent is very good.

 - rev-parse: add option for absolute or relative path formatting

 "git rev-parse" can be explicitly told to give output as absolute
 or relative path.

 Expecting a reroll.
 cf. <20200909222333.GH241078@camp.crustytoothpaste.net>

* jc/war-on-dashed-git (2020-08-27) 1 commit
 - git: catch an attempt to run "git-foo"

 The first step to remove on-disk binaries for built-in subcommands
 by soliciting objections.

 On hold for now.


* dr/push-remoteref-fix (2020-04-23) 1 commit
 - remote.c: fix handling of %(push:remoteref)

 The "%(push:remoteref)" placeholder in the "--format=" argument of
 "git format-patch" (and friends) only showed what got explicitly
 configured, not what ref at the receiving end would be updated when
 "git push" was used, as it ignored the default behaviour (e.g. update
 the same ref as the source).

 Discard for now.
 cf. <xmqqv9gu7c61.fsf@gitster.c.googlers.com>
 cf. <20200911214358.acl3hy2e763begoo@feanor>


* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2018-10-15) 1 commit
 - zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

 longer short-hand to say the same thing.

 Expecting a reroll.
 cf. <xmqqblhyepup.fsf@gitster.c.googlers.com>


* sb/clone-origin (2020-09-30) 7 commits
 - clone: allow configurable default for `-o`/`--origin`

 + t, doc: update tests, reference for "--force-if-includes"
 + push: parse and set flag for "--force-if-includes"
 + push: add reflog check for "--force-if-includes"
 + Merge branch 'ds/in-merge-bases-many-optim-bug' into sk/force-if-includes

 "git push --force-with-lease[=<ref>]" can easily be misused to lose
 commits unless the user takes good care of their own "git fetch".
 A new option "--force-if-includes" attempts to ensure that what is
 being force-pushed was created after examining the commit at the
 tip of the remote ref that is about to be force-replaced.

 Will merge to 'master'.
