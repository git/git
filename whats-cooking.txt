Subject: What's cooking in git.git (Aug 2017, #04; Fri, 18)

What's cooking in git.git (Aug 2017, #04; Fri, 18)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

The top part of the draft release notes for the next cycle, which I
tentatively called Git 2.15, declares that "git add ''" will still
be supported up to this release but will become illegal after that.
Given that a typical release cycle is 8-12 weeks, that will happen
sometime early next year.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* cc/subprocess-handshake-missing-capabilities (2017-08-16) 1 commit
 - sub-process: print the cmd when a capability is unsupported

 When handshake with a subprocess filter notices that the process
 asked for an unknown capability, Git did not report what program
 the offending subprocess was running.  This has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 We may want a follow-up fix to tighten the error checking, though.


* tb/apply-with-crlf (2017-08-17) 3 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - apply: file commited with CRLF should roundtrip diff and apply
 - convert: add SAFE_CRLF_KEEP_CRLF
 (this branch is tangled with jc/apply-with-crlf.)

 "git apply" that is used as a better "patch -p1" failed to apply a
 taken from a file with CRLF line endings to a file with CRLF line
 endings.  The root cause was because it misused convert_to_git()
 that tried to do "safe-crlf" processing by looking at the index
 entry at the same path, which is a nonsense---in that mode, "apply"
 is not working on the data in (or derived from) the index at all.
 This has been fixed.

 Will merge to 'next' after squashing the fix in.


* rs/t1002-do-not-use-sum (2017-08-15) 1 commit
 - t1002: stop using sum(1)

 Test simplification.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sb/sha1-file-cleanup (2017-08-15) 1 commit
 - sha1_file: make read_info_alternates static

 Code clean-up.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* as/grep-quiet-no-match-exit-code-fix (2017-08-17) 1 commit
 - git-grep: correct exit code with --quiet and -L

 "git grep -L" and "git grep --quiet -L" reported different exit
 codes; this has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* hv/t5526-andand-chain-fix (2017-08-17) 1 commit
 - t5526: fix some broken && chains

 Test fix.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jc/diff-sane-truncate-no-more (2017-08-17) 1 commit
 - diff: retire sane_truncate_fn

 Code clean-up.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ks/branch-set-upstream (2017-08-17) 3 commits
 - branch: quote branch/ref names to improve readability
 - builtin/branch: stop supporting the "--set-upstream" option
 - t3200: cleanup cruft of a test

 "branch --set-upstream" that has been deprecated in Git 1.8 has
 finally been retired.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* mg/format-ref-doc-fix (2017-08-18) 2 commits
 - Documentation/git-for-each-ref: clarify peeling of tags for --format
 - Documentation: use proper wording for ref format strings

 Doc fix.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* po/read-graft-line (2017-08-18) 4 commits
 - commit: rewrite read_graft_line
 - commit: allocate array using object_id size
 - commit: replace the raw buffer with strbuf in read_graft_line
 - sha1_file: fix definition of null_sha1

 Conversion from uchar[20] to struct object_id continues; this is to
 ensure that we do not assume sizeof(struct object_id) is the same
 as the length of SHA-1 hash (or length of longest hash we support).

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sb/submodule-parallel-update (2017-08-17) 1 commit
 - submodule.sh: remove unused variable

 Code clean-up.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jc/apply-with-crlf (2017-08-16) 6 commits
 . apply: clarify read_old_data() is about no-index case
 . apply: localize the CRLF business to read_old_data()
 . apply: only pay attention to CRLF in the preimage
 . apply: remove unused field apply_state.flags
 . apply: file commited with CRLF should roundtrip diff and apply
 - convert: add SAFE_CRLF_KEEP_CRLF
 (this branch is tangled with tb/apply-with-crlf.)

 Will discard as it now is part of the tb/apply-with-crlf topic.

* mg/status-in-progress-info (2017-05-10) 2 commits
 - status --short --inprogress: spell it as --in-progress
 - status: show in-progress info for short status

 "git status" learns an option to report various operations
 (e.g. "merging") that the user is in the middle of.

* sg/clone-refspec-from-command-line-config (2017-06-16) 2 commits
 - Documentation/clone: document ignored configuration variables
 - clone: respect additional configured fetch refspecs during initial fetch
 (this branch is used by sg/remote-no-string-refspecs.)

 "git clone -c var=val" is a way to set configuration variables in
 the resulting repository, but it is more useful to also make these
 variables take effect while the initial clone is happening,
 e.g. these configuration variables could be fetch refspecs.

 Waiting for a response.

 - bswap: add 64 bit endianness helper get_be64

 We learned to talk to watchman to speed up "git status".

 Expecting a reroll.

 - diff-delta: fix encoding size that would not fit in "unsigned int"

 The machinery to create xdelta used in pack files received the
 sizes of the data in size_t, but lost the higher bits of them by
 storing them in "unsigned int" during the computation, which is
 fixed.

 - http: drop support for curl < 7.19.4
 - http: drop support for curl < 7.16.0
 - http: drop support for curl < 7.11.1

 Some code in http.c that has bitrot is being removed.

 What is the status of the discussion around this area????


* tc/curl-with-backports (2017-08-11) 2 commits
 - http: use a feature check to enable GSSAPI delegation control
 - http: fix handling of missing CURLPROTO_*

 Updates to the HTTP layer we made recently unconditionally used
 features of libCurl without checking the existence of them, causing
 compilation errors, which has been fixed.  Also migrate the code to
 check feature macros, not version numbers, to cope better with
 libCurl that vendor ships with backported features.

 What is the doneness of this topic????


* jk/drop-sha1-entry-pos (2017-08-09) 1 commit

 - trailer: put process_trailers() options into a struct

 "git interpret-trailers" has been taught a "--parse" and a few
 other options to make it easier for scripts to grab existing
 trailer lines from a commit log message.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2017-08-10) 1 commit
 - zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

 Needs review.

 There were some concerns raised around s/off_t/size_t/ in this
 change.


* pw/am-signoff (2017-08-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-18 at 7678ed822c)
 + am: fix signoff when other trailers are present

 "git am -s" has been taught that some input may end with a trailer
 block that is not Signed-off-by: and it should refrain from adding
 an extra blank line before adding a new sign-off in such a case.

 Will merge to 'master'.

  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-18 at f222bb6db0)
 + git svn fetch: Create correct commit timestamp when using --localtime

 "git svn" used with "--localtime" option did not compute the tz
 offset for the timestamp in question and instead always used the
 current time, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jt/sha1-file-cleanup (2017-08-11) 2 commits
 - sha1_file: remove read_packed_sha1()
 - sha1_file: set whence in storage-specific info fn

 Preparatory code clean-up.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* kw/rebase-progress (2017-08-14) 2 commits
 - rebase: turn on progress option by default for format-patch
 - format-patch: have progress option while generating patches

 "git rebase", especially when it is run by mistake and ends up
 trying to replay many changes, spent long time in silence.  The
 command has been taught to show progress report when it spends
 long time preparing these many changes to replay (which would give
 the user a chance to abort with ^C).

 Will merge to 'next'.


* mk/diff-delta-avoid-large-offset (2017-08-11) 1 commit
 - diff-delta: do not allow delta offset truncation

 The delta format used in the packfile cannot reference data at
 offset larger than what can be expressed in 4-byte, but the
 generator for the data failed to make sure the offset does not
 overflow.  This has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* nm/stash-untracked (2017-08-11) 1 commit
 - stash: clean untracked files before reset

 "git stash -u" used the contents of the committed version of the
 ".gitignore" file to decide which paths are ignored, even when the
 file has local changes.  The command has been taught to instead use
 the locally modified contents.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* rs/object-id (2017-08-14) 1 commit
 - tree-walk: convert fill_tree_descriptor() to object_id

 Conversion from uchar[20] to struct object_id continues.

* jt/diff-color-move-fix (2017-08-16) 3 commits
 - diff: define block by number of alphanumeric chars
 - diff: respect MIN_BLOCK_LENGTH for last block
 - diff: avoid redundantly clearing a flag
 (this branch uses sb/diff-color-move.)

 A handful of bugfixes and an improvement to "diff --color-moved".

 Will merge to 'next'.


* kd/stash-with-bash-4.4 (2017-08-14) 1 commit
 - stash: prevent warning about null bytes in input

 bash 4.4 or newer gave a warning on NUL byte in command
 substitution done in "git stash"; this has been squelched.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* kw/commit-keep-index-when-pre-commit-is-not-run (2017-08-16) 1 commit
 - commit: skip discarding the index if there is no pre-commit hook

 "git commit" used to discard the index and re-read from the filesystem
 just in case the pre-commit hook has updated it in the middle; this
 has been optimized out when we know we do not run the pre-commit hook.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* bw/git-clang-format (2017-08-14) 2 commits
 - Makefile: add style build rule
 - clang-format: outline the git project's coding style

 "make style" runs git-clang-format to help developers by pointing
 out coding style issues.


* pw/sequence-rerere-autoupdate (2017-08-02) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-14 at 010cbb0cbe)
 + cherry-pick/revert: reject --rerere-autoupdate when continuing
 + cherry-pick/revert: remember --rerere-autoupdate
 + t3504: use test_commit
 + rebase -i: honor --rerere-autoupdate
 + rebase: honor --rerere-autoupdate
 + am: remember --rerere-autoupdate setting

 Commands like "git rebase" accepted the --rerere-autoupdate option
 from the command line, but did not always use it.  This has been
 fixed.

* bw/clone-recursive-quiet (2017-08-04) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-14 at fbd4473ce4)
 + clone: teach recursive clones to respect -q

 "git clone --recurse-submodules --quiet" did not pass the quiet
 option down to submodules.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* lg/merge-signoff (2017-07-25) 1 commit

 "git merge" learned a "--signoff" option to add the Signed-off-by:
 trailer with the committer's name.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* pb/trailers-from-command-line (2017-08-14) 4 commits
 - interpret-trailers: fix documentation typo
 - interpret-trailers: add options for actions
 - trailers: introduce struct new_trailer_item
 - trailers: export action enums and corresponding lookup functions

 "git interpret-trailers" learned to take the trailer specifications
 from the command line that overrides the configured values.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sb/submodule-recursive-checkout-detach-head (2017-07-28) 2 commits
 - Documentation/checkout: clarify submodule HEADs to be detached
 - recursive submodules: detach HEAD from new state

 "git checkout --recursive" may overwrite and rewind the history of
 the branch that happens to be checked out in submodule
 repositories, which might not be desirable.  Detach the HEAD but
 still allow the recursive checkout to succeed in such a case.

 Undecided.
 This needs justification in a larger picture; it is unclear why
 this is better than rejecting recursive checkout, for example.


* ti/external-sha1dc (2017-08-16) 2 commits
 - sha1dc: allow building with the external sha1dc library
 - sha1dc: build git plumbing code more explicitly

 Platforms that ship with a separate sha1 with collision detection
 library can link to it instead of using the copy we ship as part of
 our source tree.

 Waiting for reviews.

 (this branch uses bw/grep-recurse-submodules.)

 Code clean-up to avoid mixing values read from the .gitmodules file
 and values read from the .git/config file.


* bw/push-options-recursively-to-submodules (2017-07-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-14 at 421dc09fd0)

* bw/grep-recurse-submodules (2017-08-02) 10 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-14 at dcfcfc94af)
 + grep: recurse in-process using 'struct repository'
 + submodule: merge repo_read_gitmodules and gitmodules_config
 + submodule: check for unmerged .gitmodules outside of config parsing
 + submodule: check for unstaged .gitmodules outside of config parsing

 + config: add config_from_gitmodules
 + cache.h: add GITMODULES_FILE macro
 + repository: have the_repository use the_index
 + repo_read_index: don't discard the index
 (this branch is used by bw/submodule-config-cleanup.)

 "git grep --recurse-submodules" has been reworked to give a more
 consistent output across submodule boundary (and do its thing
 without having to fork a separate process).

 Will merge to 'master'.

 - push: disable lazy --force-with-lease by default

 Because "git push --force-with-lease[=<ref>]" that relies on the
 stability of remote-tracking branches is unsafe when something
 fetches into the repository behind user's back, it is now disabled
 by default.  A new configuration variable can be used to enable it
 by users who know what they are doing.  This would pave the way to
 possibly turn `--force` into `--force-with-lease`.

 Will discard.
 Independent from disabling the feature by default, this stirred up
 a discussion to replace the DWIM heuristics with a better one, which
 deserves to be its own topic.

  (merged to 'next' on 2017-08-14 at 24db08a6e8)
 + pathspec: die on empty strings as pathspec
 + t0027: do not use an empty string as a pathspec element

 The final step to make an empty string as a pathspec element
 illegal.  We started this by first deprecating and warning a
 pathspec that has such an element in 2.11 (Nov 2016).

 Hopefully we can merge this down to the 'master' by the end of the
 year?  A deprecation warning period that is about 1 year does not
 sound too bad.

 Will cook in 'next'.

* sd/branch-copy (2017-06-18) 3 commits
 - branch: add a --copy (-c) option to go with --move (-m)
 - branch: add test for -m renaming multiple config sections
 - config: create a function to format section headers

 "git branch" learned "-c/-C" to create and switch to a new branch
 by copying an existing one.

 I personally do not think "branch --copy master backup" while on
 "master" that switches to "backup" is a good UI, and I *will* say
 "I told you so" when users complain after we merge this down to
 'master'.

 (this branch is used by jt/diff-color-move-fix.)

 "git diff" has been taught to optionally paint new lines that are
 the same as deleted lines elsewhere differently from genuinely new
 lines.

 Will merge to 'next'.
 ... again.

 "git gc" and friends when multiple worktrees are used off of a
 single repository did not consider the index and per-worktree refs
 of other worktrees as the root for reachability traversal, making
 objects that are in use only in other worktrees to be subject to
 garbage collection.
