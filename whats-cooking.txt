What's cooking in git.git (Feb 2020, #02; Mon, 10)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* am/checkout-file-and-ref-ref-ambiguity (2020-01-07) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-01-27 at daf1dadc78)
 + checkout: don't revert file on ambiguous tracking branches
 + parse_branchname_arg(): extract part as new function

 "git checkout X" did not correctly fail when X is not a local
 branch but could name more than one remote-tracking branches
 (i.e. to be dwimmed as the starting point to create a corresponding
 local branch), which has been corrected.


* bc/hash-independent-tests-part-7 (2020-01-15) 20 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-01-27 at a519c8fae4)

 + t4054: make hash-size independent

 Preparation of test scripts for the day when the object names will
 use SHA-256 continues.


* dl/test-must-fail-fixes (2019-12-20) 15 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-01-27 at ed382cd096)
 + t1507: inline full_name()

* en/fill-directory-fixes-more (2020-01-16) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-01-27 at 9a27e1495b)
 + dir: point treat_leading_path() warning to the right place
 + dir: restructure in a way to avoid passing around a struct dirent
 + dir: treat_leading_path() and read_directory_recursive(), round 2
 + clean: demonstrate a bug with pathspecs
 (this branch is used by en/fill-directory-exponential.)

 Corner case bugs in "git clean" that stems from a (necessarily for
 performance reasons) awkward calling convention in the directory
 enumeration API has been corrected.


* es/fetch-show-failed-submodules-atend (2020-01-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-01-27 at 7b41163881)
 + fetch: emphasize failure during submodule fetch

 A fetch that is told to recursively fetch updates in submodules
 inevitably produces reams of output, and it becomes hard to spot
 error messages.  The command has been taught to enumerate
 submodules that had errors at the end of the operation.


* js/add-p-leftover-bits (2020-01-15) 10 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-01-27 at ec5021a1bd)

 + built-in add -p: handle Escape sequences in interactive.singlekey mode
 + built-in add -p: respect the `interactive.singlekey` config setting
 + terminal: add a new function to read a single keystroke
 + terminal: accommodate Git for Windows' default terminal
 + terminal: make the code of disable_echo() reusable
 + built-in add -p: handle diff.algorithm
 + built-in add -p: support interactive.diffFilter
 + t3701: adjust difffilter test
 (this branch uses js/patch-mode-in-others-in-c.)

 The final leg of rewriting "add -i/-p" in C.


* js/patch-mode-in-others-in-c (2019-12-21) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-01-27 at 36f6756aae)
 + commit --interactive: make it work with the built-in `add -i`
 + built-in add -p: implement the "worktree" patch modes
 + built-in add -p: implement the "checkout" patch modes
 + built-in stash: use the built-in `git add -p` if so configured
 + legacy stash -p: respect the add.interactive.usebuiltin setting
 + built-in add -p: implement the "stash" and "reset" patch modes
 + built-in add -p: prepare for patch modes other than "stage"
 (this branch is used by js/add-p-leftover-bits.)

 The effort to move "git-add--interactive" to C continues.


* km/submodule-add-errmsg (2020-01-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-01-27 at 0ff8378907)
 + submodule add: show 'add --dry-run' stderr when aborting

 Improve error message generation for "git submodule add".


* mt/sparse-checkout-doc-update (2020-01-23) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-01-27 at dbd5a83613)
 + completion: add support for sparse-checkout
 + doc: sparse-checkout: mention --cone option

 Doc update.

  (merged to 'next' on 2020-01-27 at e4cb1e376a)
 + submodule.c: use get_git_dir() instead of get_git_common_dir()
 + t2405: clarify test descriptions and simplify test
 + t2405: use git -C and test_commit -C instead of subshells
 + t7410: rename to t2405-worktree-submodule.sh

 The "--recurse-submodules" option of various subcommands did not
 work well when run in an alternate worktree, which has been
 corrected.

--------------------------------------------------

[Stalled]

* jc/format-patch-delay-message-id (2019-04-05) 1 commit
 - format-patch: move message-id and related headers to the end

 The location "git format-patch --thread" adds the Message-Id:
 header in the series of header fields has been moved down, which
 may help working around a suspected bug in GMail MSA, reported at
 <CAHk-=whP1stFZNAaJiMi5eZ9rj0MRt20Y_yHVczZPH+O01d+sA@mail.gmail.com>

 Waiting for feedback to see if it truly helps.
 Needs tests.


* pw/advise-rebase-skip (2019-12-06) 9 commits
 - rebase -i: leave CHERRY_PICK_HEAD when there are conflicts
 - rebase: fix advice when a fixup creates an empty commit
 - commit: give correct advice for empty commit during a rebase
 - commit: encapsulate determine_whence() for sequencer
 - commit: use enum value for multiple cherry-picks
 - sequencer: write CHERRY_PICK_HEAD for reword and edit
 - cherry-pick: check commit error messages
 - cherry-pick: add test for `--skip` advice in `git commit`
 - t3404: use test_cmp_rev

 The mechanism to prevent "git commit" from making an empty commit
 or amending during an interrupted cherry-pick was broken during the
 rewrite of "git rebase" in C, which has been corrected.

 What's the status of this one?
 The tip two are still RFC.


* es/pathspec-f-f-grep (2020-01-13) 1 commit
 . grep: support the --pathspec-from-file option

 "git grep" learned the "--pathspec-from-file" command line
 option.

 Getting tired of waiting for review responses.  Will discard.
 cf. <20191204203911.237056-1-emilyshaffer@google.com>


* at/rebase-fork-point-regression-fix (2019-12-09) 1 commit
 - rebase: fix --fork-point with short refname

 The "--fork-point" mode of "git rebase" regressed when the command
 was rewritten in C back in 2.20 era, which has been corrected.

 Was waiting for discussion to settle.

* ma/config-bool-valex (2019-11-14) 8 commits
 - builtin/config: die if "value_regex" doesn't canonicalize as boolean
 - builtin/config: warn if "value_regex" doesn't canonicalize as boolean
 - builtin/config: canonicalize "value_regex" with `--type=bool-or-int`
 - builtin/config: canonicalize "value_regex" with `--type=bool`
 - builtin/config: collect "value_regexp" data in a struct
 - builtin/config: extract `handle_value_regex()` from `get_value()`
 - t1300: modernize part of script
 - config: make `git_parse_maybe_bool_text()` public

 "git config" can be told to affect the existing entries that
 "match" the given value via its value_regex argument.  It learned
 to normalize the value set in the configuration and the value given
 from the command line before computing they "match", e.g. "true" in
 the configuration file can now match with "yes" given from the
 command line.

 Retracted for now.

* vn/reset-deleted-ita (2019-07-26) 1 commit
 - reset: unstage empty deleted ita files

 "git reset HEAD [<pathspec>]" did not reset an empty file that was
 added with the intent-to-add bit.

 Expecting a reroll.


* jn/unknown-index-extensions (2018-11-21) 2 commits
 . index: offer advice for unknown index extensions
 . index: do not warn about unrecognized extensions

 A bit too alarming warning given when unknown index extensions
 exist is getting revamped.

 Getting tired of waiting for a reroll.  Will discard.


* js/protocol-advertise-multi (2018-12-28) 1 commit
 . protocol: advertise multiple supported versions

 The transport layer has been updated so that the protocol version
 used can be negotiated between the parties, by the initiator
 listing the protocol versions it is willing to talk, and the other
 side choosing from one of them.

 Getting tired of waiting for a reroll.  Will discard.

* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2018-10-15) 1 commit
 - zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

 (this branch uses mr/show-config-scope; is tangled with es/bugreport.)

 "git remote rename X Y" needs to adjust configuration variables
 (e.g. branch.<name>.remote) whose value used to be X to Y.
 branch.<name>.pushRemote is now also updated.

 Waiting for mr/show-config-scope to stabilize.


* es/bright-colors (2020-01-23) 3 commits
 - color.c: alias RGB colors 8-15 to aixterm colors
 - color.c: support bright aixterm colors
 - color.c: refactor color_output arguments

 The basic 7 colors learned the brighter counterparts
 (e.g. "brightred").

 + t7400: testcase for submodule status on unregistered inner git repos
 + submodule: fix status of initialized but not cloned submodules
 + t7400: add a testcase for submodule status on empty dirs

 The way "git submodule status" reports an initialized but not yet
 populated submodule has not been reimplemented correctly when a
 part of the "git submodule" command was rewritten in C, which has
 been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ag/rebase-avoid-unneeded-checkout (2020-01-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-07 at b08da07534)
 + rebase -i: stop checking out the tip of the branch to rebase

 "git rebase -i" (and friends) used to unnecessarily check out the
 tip of the branch to be rebased, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ds/sparse-checkout-harden (2020-01-31) 15 commits

 - t1300: fix over-indented HERE-DOCs
 - config: fix typo in variable name
 (this branch is used by bw/remote-rename-update-config and es/bugreport.)

 "git config" learned to show in which "scope", in addition to in
 which file, each config setting comes from.

* bk/p4-pre-edit-changelist (2020-02-06) 5 commits
 - git-p4: add p4 submit hooks
 - git-p4: restructure code in submit
 - git-p4: add --no-verify option
 - git-p4: create new function run_git_hook
 - git-p4: rewrite prompt to be Windows compatible

 "git p4" learned four new hooks and also "--no-verify" option to
 bypass them (and the existing "p4-pre-submit" hook).


* dt/submodule-rm-with-stale-cache (2020-01-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-05 at 701ef6c41b)
 + git rm submodule: succeed if .gitmodules index stat info is zero

 Running "git rm" on a submodule failed unnecessarily when
 .gitmodules is only cache-dirty, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 - dir: replace exponential algorithm with a linear one
 - dir: refactor treat_directory to clarify control flow
 - dir: fix confusion based on variable tense
 - dir: fix broken comment
 - dir: consolidate treat_path() and treat_one_path()

 The directory traversal code had redundant recursive calls which
 made its performance characteristics exponential wrt the depth of
 the tree, which was corrected.

 Still RFC?

  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-05 at 839ae05c00)
 + git: update documentation for --git-dir

 One effect of specifying where the GIT_DIR is (either with the
 environment variable, or with the "git --git-dir=<where> cmd"
 option) is to disable the repository discovery.  This has been
 placed a bit more stress in the documentation, as new users often
 get confused.

 + diff: move diff.wsErrorHighlight to "basic" config

 The diff-* plumbing family of subcommands now pay attention to the
 diff.wsErrorHighlight configuration, which has been ignored before;
 this allows "git add -p" to also show the whitespace problems to
 the end user.

 Disambiguation logic to tell revisions and pathspec apart has been
 tweaked so that backslash-escaped glob special characters do not
 count in the "wildcards are pathspec" rule.

 The index-pack code now diagnoses a bad input packstream that
 records the same object twice when it is used as delta base; the
 code used to declare a software bug when encountering such an
 input, but it is an input error.

  (merged to 'next' on 2020-02-05 at 227bbe1e05)
 + grep: ignore --recurse-submodules if --no-index is given

 "git grep --no-index" should not get affected by the contents of
 the .gitmodules file but when "--recurse-submodules" is given or
 the "submodule.recurse" variable is set, it did.  Now these
 settings are ignored in the "--no-index" mode.

 The code to compute the commit-graph has been taught to use a more
 robust way to tell if two object directories refer to the same
 thing.

 - builtin/commit-graph.c: support '--split[=<strategy>]'
 (this branch uses tb/commit-graph-object-dir.)

 The code to write out the commit-graph has been taught a few
 options to control if the resulting graph chains should be merged
 or a single new incremental graph is created.

 Waiting for the discussion to settle.

 - doc: stash: split options from description (2)
 - doc: stash: split options from description (1)

 + rebase -i: re-fix short SHA-1 collision
 + parse_insn_line(): improve error message when parsing failed
 (this branch is used by ag/edit-todo-drop-check.)

 "git rebase -i" identifies existing commits in its todo file with
 their abbreviated object name, which could become ambigous as it
 goes to create new commits, and has a mechanism to avoid ambiguity
 in the main part of its execution.  A few other cases however were
 not covered by the protection against ambiguity, which has been
 corrected.

 + replace-object: make replace operations thread-safe
 + grep: fix racy calls in grep_objects()
 + grep: fix race conditions at grep_submodule()
 + grep: fix race conditions on userdiff calls

 Traditionally, we avoided threaded grep while searching in objects
 (as opposed to files in the working tree) as accesses to the object
 layer is not thread-safe.  This limitation is getting lifted.
