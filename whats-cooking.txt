What's cooking in git.git (Sep 2025, #11; Mon, 29)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and
aren't considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL
to a message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity (of course they can be resubmit when new interests
arise).

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-scm/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

Release tarballs are available at:

* dk/stash-apply-index (2025-09-21) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2025-09-23 at 04e76cf5be)
 + stash: honor stash.index in apply, pop modes
 + stash: refactor private config globals
 + t3905: remove unneeded blank line
 + t3903: reduce dependencies on previous tests

 The stash.index configuration variable can be set to make "git stash
 pop/apply" pretend that it was invoked with "--index".

  (merged to 'next' on 2025-09-22 at dc4168c337)
 + initial branch: give hints after switching the default name
 (this branch uses pw/3.0-default-initial-branch-to-main.)

 Keep giving hint about the default initial branch name for users
 who may be surprised after Git 3.0 switch-over.

* jk/color-variable-fixes (2025-09-16) 13 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2025-09-23 at 8aa3006a1e)
 + config: store want_color() result in a separate bool
 + add-interactive: retain colorbool values longer
 + color: return bool from want_color()
 + color: use git_colorbool enum type to store colorbools
 + pretty: use format_commit_context.auto_color as colorbool
 + diff: stop passing ecbdata->use_color as boolean
 + diff: pass o->use_color directly to fill_metainfo()
 + diff: don't use diff_options.use_color as a strict bool
 + diff: simplify color_moved check when flushing
 + grep: don't treat grep_opt.color as a strict bool
 + color: return enum from git_config_colorbool()
 + color: use GIT_COLOR_* instead of numeric constants
 + Merge branch 'jk/add-i-color' into jk/color-variable-fixes

 Some places in the code confused a variable that is *not* a boolean
 to enable color but is an enum that records what the user requested
 to do about color.  A couple of bugs of this sort have been fixed,
 while the code has been cleaned up to prevent similar bugs in the
 future.

* jk/setup-revisions-freefix (2025-09-19) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2025-09-23 at e30036fad0)
 + revision: retain argv NULL invariant in setup_revisions()
 + treewide: pass strvecs around for setup_revisions_from_strvec()
 + treewide: use setup_revisions_from_strvec() when we have a strvec
 + revision: add wrapper to setup_revisions() from a strvec
 + revision: manage memory ownership of argv in setup_revisions()
 + stash: tell setup_revisions() to free our allocated strings

 There are double frees and leaks around setup_revisions() API used
 in "git stash show", which has been fixed, and setup_revisions()
 API gained a wrapper to make it more ergonomic when using it with
 strvec-manged argc/argv pairs.

* kn/refs-files-case-insensitive (2025-09-17) 4 commits

 + refs/files: handle F/D conflicts in case-insensitive FS
 + refs/files: use correct error type when lock exists
 + refs/files: catch conflicts on case-insensitive file-systems

 Deal more gracefully with directory / file conflicts when the files
 backend is used for ref storage, by failing only the ones that are
 involved in the conflict while allowing others.

 "git rebase -i" failed to clean-up the commit log message when the

 "git replay" (experimental) learned to perform ref updates itself

 should point at and leaving the actual update to another command.

[Stalled]

These topics have been expecting updates for quite some time.  I'll
eject any of them when they start to conflict with other topics in
'seen' and may drop them from my tree when they are dormant for too
long (let's say 8 weeks is way too long, for now).  After that, they
can be proposed again by rerolling them in a shape that would work
well with other topics in 'seen' (and of course 'next' and
"master').

 - format-patch: handle range-diff on notes correctly for single patches
 - revision: add rdiff_log_arg to rev_info
 - range-diff: rename other_arg to log_arg

 "git format-patch --range-diff=... --notes=..." did not drive the
 underlying range-diff with correct --notes parameter, ending up
 comparing with different set of notes from its main patch output
 you would get from "git format-patch --notes=..." for a singleton

 all the split pieces 'selected'; this has been changed to make them

 + builtin/pack-refs: factor out core logic into a shared library
 + builtin/pack-refs: convert to use the generic refs_optimize() API
 + reftable-backend: implement 'optimize' action
 + files-backend: implement 'optimize' action
 + refs: add a generic 'optimize' API

 "git refs optimize" is added for not very well explained reason
 despite it does the same thing as "git pack-refs"...

 Will merge to 'master'.

* sj/string-list (2025-09-17) 4 commits
 - refs: enable sign compare warnings check
 - string-list: change "string_list_find_insert_index" return type to "size_t"
 - string-list: replace negative index encoding with "exact_match" parameter
 - string-list: use bool instead of int for "exact_match"

 The "string-list" API function to find where a given string would
 be inserted got updated so that it can use unrealistically huge
 array index that would only fit in size_t but not int or ssize_t
 to achieve unstated goal.

 Expecting a reroll.
