Subject: What's cooking in git.git (May 2019, #01; Thu, 9)

What's cooking in git.git (May 2019, #01; Thu, 9)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

The 8th batch of topics, which Hopefully is the final one before
-rc0, have been pushed out to 'master'.  The "no-extern" topic is
now in 'next', with its merge conflict with many other topics, is
still slowing me down when it is moved earlier in the merge order.
I expect it to need only one more topic shuffling before merged to
'master', so I hope I'd survive.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* cc/aix-has-fileno-as-a-macro (2019-04-25) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-25 at f1d6464f98)
 + Makefile: use fileno macro work around on AIX
 (this branch is used by cc/access-on-aix-workaround.)

 AIX shared the same build issues with other BSDs around fileno(fp),
 which has been corrected.


* cc/replace-graft-peel-tags (2019-04-15) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-25 at f8d0db27ba)
 + replace: peel tag when passing a tag first to --graft
 + replace: peel tag when passing a tag as parent to --graft
 + t6050: redirect expected error output to a file
 + t6050: use test_line_count instead of wc -l

 When given a tag that points at a commit-ish, "git replace --graft"
 failed to peel the tag before writing a replace ref, which did not
 make sense because the old graft mechanism the feature wants to
 mimick only allowed to replace one commit object with another.
 This has been fixed.


* dl/merge-cleanup-scissors-fix (2019-04-19) 10 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-25 at 2014eef6b1)
 + cherry-pick/revert: add scissors line on merge conflict
 + sequencer.c: save and restore cleanup mode
 + merge: add scissors line on merge conflict
 + merge: cleanup messages like commit
 + parse-options.h: extract common --cleanup option
 + commit: extract cleanup_mode functions to sequencer
 + t7502: clean up style
 + t7604: clean up style
 + t3507: clean up style
 + t7600: clean up style
 (this branch uses pw/sequencer-cleanup-with-signoff-x-fix.)

 The list of conflicted paths shown in the editor while concluding a
 conflicted merge was shown above the scissors line when the
 clean-up mode is set to "scissors", even though it was commented
 out just like the list of updated paths and other information to
 help the user explain the merge better.


* dl/warn-tagging-a-tag (2019-04-12) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-25 at 8b966d7fe8)
 + tag: advise on nested tags
 + tag: fix formatting

 "git tag" learned to give an advice suggesting it might be a
 mistake when creating an annotated or signed tag that points at
 another tag.


* dr/ref-filter-push-track-fix (2019-04-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-25 at 07db067adc)
 + ref-filter: use correct branch for %(push:track)

 %(push:track) token used in the --format option to "git
 for-each-ref" and friends was not showing the right branch, which
 has been fixed.


* en/merge-directory-renames (2019-04-08) 15 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-25 at fd5b4f57b4)
 + merge-recursive: switch directory rename detection default
 + merge-recursive: give callers of handle_content_merge() access to contents
 + merge-recursive: track information associated with directory renames
 + t6043: fix copied test description to match its purpose
 + merge-recursive: switch from (oid,mode) pairs to a diff_filespec
 + merge-recursive: cleanup handle_rename_* function signatures
 + merge-recursive: track branch where rename occurred in rename struct
 + merge-recursive: remove ren[12]_other fields from rename_conflict_info
 + merge-recursive: shrink rename_conflict_info
 + merge-recursive: move some struct declarations together
 + merge-recursive: use 'ci' for rename_conflict_info variable name
 + merge-recursive: rename locals 'o' and 'a' to 'obuf' and 'abuf'
 + merge-recursive: rename diff_filespec 'one' to 'o'
 + merge-recursive: rename merge_options argument from 'o' to 'opt'
 + Use 'unsigned short' for mode, like diff_filespec does

 "git merge-recursive" backend recently learned a new heuristics to
 infer file movement based on how other files in the same directory
 moved.  As this is inherently less robust heuristics than the one
 based on the content similarity of the file itself (rather than
 based on what its neighbours are doing), it sometimes gives an
 outcome unexpected by the end users.  This has been toned down to
 leave the renamed paths in higher/conflicted stages in the index so
 that the user can examine and confirm the result.


* jk/pack-objects-reports-num-objects-to-trace2 (2019-04-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-25 at e79464c054)
 + pack-objects: write objects packed to trace2

 The "git pack-objects" command learned to report the number of
 objects it packed via the trace2 mechanism.


* jk/prune-optim (2019-04-19) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-25 at c50353b27f)
 + t5304: add a test for pruning with bitmaps

 A follow-up test for an earlier "git prune" improvements.


* jk/untracked-cache-more-fixes (2019-04-19) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-25 at a6037ddd54)
 + untracked-cache: simplify parsing by dropping "len"
 + untracked-cache: simplify parsing by dropping "next"
 + untracked-cache: be defensive about missing NULs in index

 Code clean-up.


* js/misc-doc-fixes (2019-04-19) 8 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-25 at 6898f709d0)
 + Turn `git serve` into a test helper
 + test-tool: handle the `-C <directory>` option just like `git`
 + check-docs: do not bother checking for legacy scripts' documentation
 + docs: exclude documentation for commands that have been excluded
 + check-docs: allow command-list.txt to contain excluded commands
 + help -a: do not list commands that are excluded from the build
 + Makefile: drop the NO_INSTALL variable
 + remote-testgit: move it into the support directory for t5801

 "make check-docs", "git help -a", etc. did not account for cases
 where a particular build may deliberately omit some subcommands,
 which has been corrected.


* js/trace2-to-directory (2019-03-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-25 at 53adf71c41)
 + trace2: write to directory targets

 The trace2 tracing facility learned to auto-generate a filename
 when told to log to a directory.


* jt/clone-server-option (2019-04-18) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-25 at 21f07cc85d)
 + clone: send server options when using protocol v2
 + transport: die if server options are unsupported

 "git clone" learned a new --server-option option when talking over
 the protocol version 2.


* jt/submodule-repo-is-with-worktree (2019-04-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-25 at da2c6d684d)
 + worktree: update is_bare heuristics

 The logic to tell if a Git repository has a working tree protects
 "git branch -D" from removing the branch that is currently checked
 out by mistake.  The implementation of this logic was broken for
 repositories with unusual name, which unfortunately is the norm for
 submodules these days.  This has been fixed.


* km/empty-repo-is-still-a-repo (2019-04-10) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-25 at bb3d4406a5)
 + add: error appropriately on repository with no commits
 + dir: do not traverse repositories with no commits
 + submodule: refuse to add repository with no commits

 Running "git add" on a repository created inside the current
 repository is an explicit indication that the user wants to add it
 as a submodule, but when the HEAD of the inner repository is on an
 unborn branch, it cannot be added as a submodule.  Worse, the files
 in its working tree can be added as if they are a part of the outer
 repository, which is not what the user wants.  These problems are
 being addressed.


* nd/sha1-name-c-wo-the-repository (2019-04-16) 34 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-25 at d826918329)
 + sha1-name.c: remove the_repo from get_oid_mb()
 + sha1-name.c: remove the_repo from other get_oid_*
 + sha1-name.c: remove the_repo from maybe_die_on_misspelt_object_name

 + sha1-name.c: remove the_repo from get_describe_name()
 + sha1-name.c: remove the_repo from get_oid_oneline()

 + sha1-name.c: remove the_repo from interpret_branch_mark()
 + sha1-name.c: remove the_repo from interpret_nth_prior_checkout()
 + sha1-name.c: remove the_repo from get_short_oid()
 + sha1-name.c: add repo_for_each_abbrev()
 + sha1-name.c: store and use repo in struct disambiguate_state
 + sha1-name.c: add repo_find_unique_abbrev_r()
 + sha1-name.c: remove the_repo from find_abbrev_len_packed()
 + sha1-name.c: remove the_repo from sort_ambiguous()
 + commit.c: add repo_get_commit_tree()
 + commit.cocci: refactor code, avoid double rewrite
 + refs.c: remove the_repo from read_ref_at()
 + refs.c: add repo_dwim_log()
 + refs.c: add repo_dwim_ref()
 + refs.c: remove the_repo from expand_ref()
 + refs.c: remove the_repo from substitute_branch_name()
 + refs.c: add refs_shorten_unambiguous_ref()
 + refs.c: add refs_ref_exists()
 + packfile.c: add repo_approximate_object_count()
 + builtin rebase: use oideq()
 + builtin rebase: use FREE_AND_NULL

 Further code clean-up to allow the lowest level of name-to-object
 mapping layer to work with a passed-in repository other than the
 default one.


* pw/sequencer-cleanup-with-signoff-x-fix (2019-04-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-25 at cc587fb2b9)
 + sequencer: fix cleanup with --signoff and -x
 (this branch is used by dl/merge-cleanup-scissors-fix.)

 "git cherry-pick" run with the "-x" or the "--signoff" option used
 to (and more importantly, ought to) clean up the commit log message
 with the --cleanup=space option by default, but this has been
 broken since late 2017.  This has been fixed.


* ss/msvc-path-utils-fix (2019-04-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-25 at ee2850da18)
 + MSVC: include compat/win32/path-utils.h for MSVC, too, for real_path()

 An earlier update for MinGW and Cygwin accidentally broke MSVC build,
 which has been fixed.


* tb/unexpected (2019-04-10) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-25 at c49927fca0)
 + rev-list: detect broken root trees
 + rev-list: let traversal die when --missing is not in use
 + get_commit_tree(): return NULL for broken tree
 + list-objects.c: handle unexpected non-tree entries
 + list-objects.c: handle unexpected non-blob entries
 + t: introduce tests for unexpected object types
 + t: move 'hex2oct' into test-lib-functions.sh

 Code tightening against a "wrong" object appearing where an object
 of a different type is expected, instead of blindly assuming that
 the connection between objects are correctly made.


* tz/git-svn-doc-markup-fix (2019-04-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-25 at 3efaa6285c)
 + Documentation/git-svn: improve asciidoctor compatibility

 Doc formatting fix.


* vk/autoconf-gettext (2019-04-19) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-25 at 918870cbc2)
 + autoconf: #include <libintl.h> when checking for gettext()

 The autoconf generated configure script failed to use the right
 gettext() implementations from -libintl by ignoring useless stub
 implementations shipped in some C library, which has been
 corrected.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* ab/perf-installed-fix (2019-05-08) 6 commits
 - perf-lib.sh: forbid the use of GIT_TEST_INSTALLED
 - perf tests: add "bindir" prefix to git tree test results

 - perf-lib.sh: make "./run <revisions>" use the correct gits
 - perf aggregate: remove GIT_TEST_INSTALLED from --codespeed
 - perf README: correct docs for 3c8f12c96c regression

 Performance test framework has been broken and measured the version
 of Git that happens to be on $PATH, not the specified one to
 measure, for a while, which has been corrected.

 - branch: make create_branch accept a merge base rev
 - t2018: cleanup in current test

 "git branch new A...B" and "git checkout -b new A...B" have been
 taught that in their contexts, the notation A...B means "the merge
 base between these two commits", just like "git checkout A...B"
 detaches HEAD at that commit.

 - fast-export: do automatic reencoding of commit messages only if requested
 - fast-export: differentiate between explicitly utf-8 and implicitly utf-8
 - fast-export: avoid stripping encoding header if we cannot reencode
 - fast-import: support 'encoding' commit header
 - t9350: fix encoding test to actually test reencoding

 The "git fast-export/import" pair has been taught to handle commits

 like we can already do so under address sanitizer.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/cocci-batch (2019-05-08) 2 commits
 - coccicheck: make batch size of 0 mean "unlimited"

 Will merge to 'next'.
 cf. <pull.185.git.gitgitgadget@gmail.com>
 It might be helpful in the longer term to encapsulate the code that
 uses /proc/$$/winpid into a helper function and use it anywhere $$
 is referenced, but let's defer it until we see such a callsite that
 would be helped by such a move.


* mh/http-fread-api-fix (2019-05-08) 1 commit
 - Make fread/fwrite-like functions in http.c more like fread/fwrite.

 A pair of private functions in http.c that had names similar to
 fread/fwrite did not return the number of elements, which was found
 to be confusing.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* nd/merge-quit (2019-05-07) 2 commits
 - merge: add --quit
 - merge: remove drop_save() in favor of remove_merge_branch_state()

 "git merge" learned "--quit" option that cleans up the in-progress
 merge while leaving the working tree and the index still in a mess.

 Hmph, why is this a good idea?


* nd/parse-options-aliases (2019-05-07) 1 commit
 - parse-options: don't emit "ambiguous option" for aliases

 Attempt to use an abbreviated option in "git clone --recurs" is
 responded by a request to disambiguate between --recursive and
 --recurse-submodules, which is bad because these two are synonyms.
 The parse-options API has been extended to define such synonyms
 more easily and not produce an unnecessary failure.

* sg/ci-libsvn-perl (2019-05-07) 1 commit
 - ci: install 'libsvn-perl' instead of 'git-svn'

 - send-email: honor transferencoding config option again

* jc/make-dedup-ls-files-output (2019-04-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-05-09 at e3d5825003)
 + Makefile: dedup list of files obtained from ls-files

 A "ls-files" that emulates "find" to enumerate files in the working
 tree resulted in duplicated Makefile rules that caused the build to
 issue an unnecessary warning during a trial build after merge
 conflicts are resolved in working tree *.h files but before the
 resolved results are added to the index.  This has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.
 A not-so-low hanging fruit to teach ls-files to dedup either optionally
 or always has also been discussed, which probably is a good idea,
 to prevent mistakes similar to the bug this topic fixes in the future.

 - Honor core.precomposeUnicode in more places

 The names of the refs stored as filesystem entities may become

 around by paying attemption to the core.precomposeUnicode

 The script to aggregate perf result unconditionally depended on
 libjson-perl even though it did not have to, which has been
 corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 Update "git difftool" and "git mergetool" so that the combinations
 of {diff,merge}.{tool,guitool} configuration variables serve as
 fallback settings of each other in a sensible order.

 + commit/reset: try to clean up sequencer state

 "git chery-pick" (and "revert" that shares the same runtime engine)
 that deals with multiple commits got confused when the final step
 gets stopped with a conflict and the user concluded the sequence
 with "git commit".  Attempt to fix it by cleaning up the state
 files used by these commands in such a situation.

 - t/perf: add perf script for partial clones
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-04-25 at ebd8b4bffd)
 + clone: do faster object check for partial clones

 During an initial "git clone --depth=..." partial clone, it is
 pointless to spend cycles for a large portion of the connectivity
 check that enumerates and skips promisor objects (which by
 definition is all objects fetched from the other side).  This has
 been optimized out.

 Will merge to 'next' and then to 'master'.


* cc/multi-promisor (2019-04-15) 17 commits

 - promisor-remote: implement promisor_remote_get_direct()
 - Add initial support for many promisor remotes
 - fetch-object: make functions return an error code
 - t0410: remove pipes after git commands
 - Merge branch 'jt/batch-fetch-blobs-in-diff' into cc/multi-promisor

 Teach the lazy clone machinery that there can be more than one
 promisor remote and consult them in order when downloading missing
 objects on demand.

 Needs review.

 - git-checkout.txt: fix monospace typeset
 - doc: document --overwrite-ignore
 - git-checkout.txt: fix one syntax line
 - git-checkout.txt: spell out --no-option

 Two new commands "git switch" and "git restore" are introduced to
 split "checking out a branch to work on advancing its history" and
 "checking out paths out of the index and/or a tree-ish to work on
 advancing the current history" out of the single "git checkout"
 command.

 The "switch" part seems more or less ready for testing.  Perhaps
 we should split this back into two topics and merge it to 'next'.

 - rebase: refactor can_fast_forward into goto tower
 - t3432: test rebase fast-forward behavior
 - t3431: add rebase --fork-point tests

 "git rebase --keep-base <upstream>" tries to find the original base
 of the topic being rebased and rebase on top of that same base,
 which is useful when running the "git rebase -i" (and its limited
 variant "git rebase -x").

 The command also has learned to fast-forward in more cases where it
 can instead of replaying to recreate identical commits.

 On hold.

* nd/worktree-name-sanitization (2019-03-20) 2 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - worktree add: sanitize worktree names

 In recent versions of Git, per-worktree refs are exposed in
 refs/worktrees/<wtname>/ hierarchy, which means that worktree names
 must be a valid refname component.  The code now sanitizes the names
 given to worktrees, to make sure these refs are well-formed.

 I am inclined to squash the fix at the tip in and merge the result
 to 'next'.  Opinions?

 Retracted.

 I am not sure what aspect of this longer-term "precious" vision,
 which gets taught to various commands and use cases individually
 and incrementally, Ævar finds problematic, which I understand is
 the reason of redtraction.
