What's cooking in git.git (Mar 2020, #03; Mon, 9)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* am/mingw-poll-fix (2020-02-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-03-02 at 7082619f34)
 + mingw: workaround for hangs when sending STDIN

 MinGW's poll() emulation has been improved.


* am/pathspec-f-f-more (2020-02-19) 8 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-03-02 at 33ff7e29f0)
 + stash push: support the --pathspec-from-file option
 + stash: eliminate crude option parsing
 + doc: stash: synchronize <pathspec> description
 + doc: stash: document more options
 + doc: stash: split options from description (2)
 + doc: stash: split options from description (1)
 + rm: support the --pathspec-from-file option
 + doc: rm: synchronize <pathspec> description

 "git rm" and "git stash" learns the new "--pathspec-from-file"
 option.


* en/merge-path-collision (2020-02-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-03-02 at cb2655c779)
 + merge-recursive: apply collision handling unification to recursive case

 Handling of conflicting renames in merge-recursive have further
 been made consistent with how existing codepaths try to mimic what
 is done to add/add conflicts.


* en/test-cleanup (2020-02-27) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-03-02 at 93a81886b7)
 + t6020: new test with interleaved lexicographic ordering of directories
 + t6022, t6046: test expected behavior instead of testing a proxy for it
 + t3035: prefer test_must_fail to bash negation for git commands
 + t6020, t6022, t6035: update merge tests to use test helper functions
 + t602[1236], t6034: modernize test formatting

 Test cleanup.


* hd/show-one-mergetag-fix (2020-03-02) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-03-02 at 12fe907f8d)
 + show_one_mergetag: print non-parent in hex form.

 "git show" and others gave an object name in raw format in its
 error output, which has been corrected to give it in hex.


* kk/complete-diff-color-moved (2020-02-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-03-02 at 1bdb401f6a)
 + completion: add diff --color-moved[-ws]

 Completion update.


* pb/am-show-current-patch (2020-02-20) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-03-02 at 30b5300705)
 + am: support --show-current-patch=diff to retrieve .git/rebase-apply/patch
 + am: support --show-current-patch=raw as a synonym for--show-current-patch
 + am: convert "resume" variable to a struct
 + parse-options: convert "command mode" to a flag
 + parse-options: add testcases for OPT_CMDMODE()

 "git am --short-current-patch" is a way to show the piece of e-mail
 for the stopped step, which is not suitable to directly feed "git
 apply" (it is designed to be a good "git am" input).  It learned a
 new option to show only the patch part.


* rj/t1050-use-test-path-is-file (2020-02-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-03-02 at 68a681640e)
 + t1050: replace test -f with test_path_is_file

 Code cleanup.


* rs/show-progress-in-dumb-http-fetch (2020-03-03) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-03-05 at 98ed6360e7)
 + remote-curl: show progress for fetches over dumb HTTP

 "git fetch" over HTTP walker protocol did not show any progress
 output.  We inherently do not know how much work remains, but still
 we can show something not to bore users.


* rt/format-zero-length-fix (2020-02-28) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-03-02 at a4070ef573)
 + config.mak.dev: re-enable -Wformat-zero-length
 + rebase-interactive.c: silence format-zero-length warnings

 Recently we inadvertently added a few instances of using 0-width
 format string to functions that we mark as printf-like without any
 developers noticing.  The root cause was that the compiler warning
 that is triggered by this is almost always useless and we disabled
 the warning in our developer builds, but not for general public.
 The new instances have been corrected, and the warning has been
 resurrected in the developer builds.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* hi/gpg-prefer-check-signature (2020-03-05) 2 commits
 - gpg-interface: prefer check_signature() for GPG verification
 - t: increase test coverage of signature verification output

 The code to interface with GnuPG has been refactored.


* jc/maintain-doc (2020-03-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-03-09 at 7f1a754f60)
 + update how-to-maintain-git

 Doc update.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* am/real-path-fix (2020-03-06) 4 commits
 - get_superproject_working_tree(): return strbuf
 - real_path_if_valid(): remove unsafe API
 - real_path: remove unsafe API
 - set_git_dir: fix crash when used with real_path()

 The real_path() convenience function can easily be misused; with a
 bit of code refactoring in the callers' side, its use has been
 eliminated.

 Expecting a reroll.

* ds/sparse-add (2020-03-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-03-09 at 4e675cfd89)
 + t1091: don't grep for `strerror()` string

 Test fix.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 - Makefile: alphabetically sort += lists

 "git merge" learns the "--autostash" option.

 Expecting a reroll.

* bk/p4-pre-edit-changelist (2020-02-14) 7 commits
 - git-p4: add RCS keyword status message
 - git-p4: add p4 submit hooks
 - git-p4: restructure code in submit
 - git-p4: add --no-verify option
 - git-p4: add p4-pre-submit exit text
 - git-p4: create new function run_git_hook
 - git-p4: rewrite prompt to be Windows compatible

 "git p4" learned four new hooks and also "--no-verify" option to
 bypass them (and the existing "p4-pre-submit" hook).

 Waiting for response to RFH from Windows/Python folks.
 cf. <pull.698.v6.git.git.1581691486.gitgitgadget@gmail.com>


* en/fill-directory-exponential (2020-01-31) 6 commits
 - t7063: blindly accept diffs
 - dir: replace exponential algorithm with a linear one
 - dir: refactor treat_directory to clarify control flow
 - dir: fix confusion based on variable tense
 - dir: fix broken comment
 - dir: consolidate treat_path() and treat_one_path()

 The directory traversal code had redundant recursive calls which
 made its performance characteristics exponential with respect to
 the depth of the tree, which was corrected.

 Expecting an update.

* vn/reset-deleted-ita (2019-07-26) 1 commit
 - reset: unstage empty deleted ita files

 "git reset HEAD [<pathspec>]" did not reset an empty file that was
 added with the intent-to-add bit.

 Expecting a reroll.


* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2018-10-15) 1 commit
 - zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

[Cooking]

* dr/push-remote-ref-update (2020-03-03) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-03-09 at 5a72128815)
 + remote: drop "explicit" parameter from remote_ref_for_branch()

 Code clean-up.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* tb/commit-graph-split-merge (2020-03-05) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-03-09 at f3aa7bb305)
 + builtin/commit-graph.c: support '--input=none'
 + builtin/commit-graph.c: introduce '--input=<source>'
 + builtin/commit-graph.c: support '--split[=<strategy>]'

 The code to write out the commit-graph has been taught a few
 options to control if the resulting graph chains should be merged
 or a single new incremental graph is created.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* ah/force-pull-rebase-configuration (2020-03-05) 2 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - pull: warn if the user didn't say whether to rebase or to merge

 "git pull" learned to warn when no pull.rebase configuration
 exists, and neither --[no-]rebase nor --ff-only is given (which
 would result a merge).

 Needs to add some tests.


* tg/retire-scripted-stash (2020-03-05) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-03-05 at 8e82eb9dec)
 + stash: remove the stash.useBuiltin setting
 + stash: get git_stash_config at the top level

 "git stash" has kept an escape hatch to use the scripted version
 for a few releases, which got stale.  It has been removed.

 Will cook in 'next'.
 cf. <20200306172913.GF1571684@cat>


* es/outside-repo-errmsg-hints (2020-03-03) 1 commit
 - prefix_path: show gitdir if worktree unavailable

 An earlier update to show the location of working tree in the error
 message did not consider the possibility that a git command may be
 run in a bare repository, which has been corrected.

 May want a test or two.


* js/https-proxy-config (2020-03-05) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-03-09 at 8a06f8501d)
 + http: add environment variable support for HTTPS proxies
 + http: add client cert support for HTTPS proxies

 A handful of options to configure SSL when talking to proxies have
 been added.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* jc/doc-single-h-is-for-help (2020-02-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-03-09 at 9580bb63a2)
 + Documentation: clarify that `-h` alone stands for `help`

 Both "git ls-remote -h" and "git grep -h" give short usage help,
 like any other Git subcommand, but it is not unreasonable to expect
 that the former would behave the same as "git ls-remote --head"
 (there is no other sensible behaviour for the latter).  The
 documentation has been updated in an attempt to clarify this.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* pw/advise-rebase-skip (2019-12-06) 9 commits
 - rebase -i: leave CHERRY_PICK_HEAD when there are conflicts
 - rebase: fix advice when a fixup creates an empty commit
 - commit: give correct advice for empty commit during a rebase
 - commit: encapsulate determine_whence() for sequencer
 - commit: use enum value for multiple cherry-picks
 - sequencer: write CHERRY_PICK_HEAD for reword and edit
 - cherry-pick: check commit error messages
 - cherry-pick: add test for `--skip` advice in `git commit`
 - t3404: use test_cmp_rev

 The mechanism to prevent "git commit" from making an empty commit
 or amending during an interrupted cherry-pick was broken during the
 rewrite of "git rebase" in C, which has been corrected.

 Will discard the tip two, which are still RFC, and advance the rest.
 cf. <xmqq7e0e7d9z.fsf@gitster-ct.c.googlers.com>


* at/rebase-fork-point-regression-fix (2020-02-11) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-03-02 at a1a84d37a7)
 + rebase: --fork-point regression fix

 The "--fork-point" mode of "git rebase" regressed when the command
 was rewritten in C back in 2.20 era, which has been corrected.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* jc/describe-misnamed-annotated-tag (2020-02-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-03-02 at b4e2ca6a46)
 + describe: force long format for a name based on a mislocated tag

 When "git describe C" finds an annotated tag with tagname A to be
 the best name to explain commit C, and the tag is stored in a
 "wrong" place in the refs/tags hierarchy, e.g. refs/tags/B, the
 command gave a warning message but used A (not B) to describe C.
 If C is exactly at the tag, the describe output would be "A", but
 "git rev-parse A^0" would not be equal as "git rev-parse C^0".  The
 behavior of the command has been changed to use the "long" form
 i.e. A-0-gOBJECTNAME, which is correctly interpreted by rev-parse.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* pb/recurse-submodules-fix (2020-02-19) 6 commits
 - t/lib-submodule-update: add test removing nested submodules
 - unpack-trees: check for missing submodule directory in merged_entry
 - unpack-trees: remove outdated description for verify_clean_submodule
 - t/lib-submodule-update: move a test to the right section
 - t/lib-submodule-update: remove outdated test description
 - t7112: remove mention of KNOWN_FAILURE_SUBMODULE_RECURSIVE_NESTED


* bc/sha-256-part-1-of-4 (2020-02-28) 22 commits
 - fast-import: add options for rewriting submodules
 - fast-import: add a generic function to iterate over marks
 - fast-import: make find_marks work on any mark set
 - fast-import: add helper function for inserting mark object entries
 - fast-import: permit reading multiple marks files
 - commit: use expected signature header for SHA-256
 - worktree: allow repository version 1
 - init-db: move writing repo version into a function
 - builtin/init-db: add environment variable for new repo hash
 - builtin/init-db: allow specifying hash algorithm on command line
 - setup: allow check_repository_format to read repository format
 - t/helper: make repository tests hash independent
 - t/helper: initialize repository if necessary
 - t/helper/test-dump-split-index: initialize git repository
 - t6300: make hash algorithm independent
 - t6300: abstract away SHA-1-specific constants
 - t: use hash-specific lookup tables to define test constants
 - repository: require a build flag to use SHA-256
 - hex: add functions to parse hex object IDs in any algorithm
 - hex: introduce parsing variants taking hash algorithms
 - hash: implement and use a context cloning function
 - builtin/pack-objects: make hash agnostic

 SHA-256 transition continues.

 Tentatively I dropped the bits about signed tag, as it depended on
 a reverted change to the gpg interface API.


* hw/advise-ng (2020-03-05) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-03-09 at ea9e5a1fa3)
 + tag: use new advice API to check visibility
 + advice: revamp advise API
 + advice: change "setupStreamFailure" to "setUpstreamFailure"
 + advice: extract vadvise() from advise()

 Revamping of the advise API to allow more systematic enumeration of
 advice knobs in the future.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* hn/reftable (2020-02-26) 6 commits
 . Reftable support for git-core
 . Add reftable library
 . reftable: file format documentation
 . refs: document how ref_iterator_advance_fn should handle symrefs
 . create .git/refs in files-backend.c
 . refs.h: clarify reflog iteration order

 A new refs backend "reftable" to replace the traditional
 combination of packed-refs files and one-file-per-ref loose refs
 has been implemented and integrated for improved performance and
 atomicity.

 Temporarily ejected as this unfortunately conflicts with the
 SHA-256 topic.


* es/bugreport (2020-03-06) 6 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - bugreport: add compiler info
 - bugreport: add uname info
 - bugreport: gather git version and build info
 - bugreport: add tool to generate debugging info
 - help: move list_config_help to builtin/help

 The "bugreport" tool.

 As the scope of the topic got trimmed, hopefully these early parts
 can be polished quickly enough?


* gs/commit-graph-path-filter (2020-02-12) 12 commits
 - (bytesex breakage band-aid)
 - commit-graph: add GIT_TEST_COMMIT_GRAPH_CHANGED_PATHS test flag
 - revision.c: use Bloom filters to speed up path based revision walks
 - commit-graph: add --changed-paths option to write subcommand
 - commit-graph: reuse existing Bloom filters during write.
 - commit-graph: write Bloom filters to commit graph file
 - commit-graph: examine commits by generation number
 - commit-graph: examine changed-path objects in pack order
 - commit-graph: compute Bloom filters for changed paths
 - diff: halt tree-diff early after max_changes
 - bloom: core Bloom filter implementation for changed paths
 - commit-graph: use MAX_NUM_CHUNKS

 Introduce an extension to the commit-graph to make it efficient to
 check for the paths that were modified at each commit using Bloom
 filters.

 Will be rerolled with bytesex fixes squashed in.
 Breakage due to byte-order dependency reported.
