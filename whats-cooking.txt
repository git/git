What's cooking in git.git (Aug 2009, #04; Sun, 23)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones
marked with '.' do not appear in any of the integration branches, but I am
still holding onto them.

After the 1.6.5 cycle, the next release will be 1.7.0, and we will push
out the planned "push safety" change.  1.7.0 would be a good time to
introduce "justifiable" changes that are not strictly backward compatible.

During 1.6.5 cycle, 'next' will hold topics meant for 1.6.5 and 1.7.0.

[New Topics]

* jc/mailinfo-scissors (2009-08-23) 1 commit
 - Teach mailinfo to ignore everything before -- >8 -- mark

 - xutils: Fix xdl_recmatch() on incomplete lines
 - xutils: Fix hashing an incomplete line with whitespaces at the end

  (merged to 'next' on 2009-08-22 at 5106de8)
 + send-email: make --no-chain-reply-to the default

 - Improve on 'approxidate'

* mm/reset-report (2009-08-21) 2 commits
 - reset: make the reminder output consistent with "checkout"

[Stalled]

* sr/gfi-options (2009-08-13) 3 commits
 - fast-import: test the new option command
 - fast-import: add option command
 - fast-import: put option parsing code in seperate functions

What is this used by?

* lt/block-sha1 (2009-08-17) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-08-18 at 67a1ce8)
 + remove ARM and Mozilla SHA1 implementations
 + block-sha1: guard gcc extensions with __GNUC__
 + make sure byte swapping is optimal for git
 + block-sha1: make the size member first in the context struct

Finishing touches ;-)  There were a few Solaris portability patches
floated around that I didn't pick up, waiting for them to finalize.

* js/stash-dwim (2009-07-27) 1 commit.
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-08-16 at 67896c4)
 + Make 'git stash -k' a short form for 'git stash save --keep-index'
 (this branch is used by tr/reset-checkout-patch.)

* tr/reset-checkout-patch (2009-08-18) 8 commits.
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-08-18 at e465bb3)
 + tests: disable interactive hunk selection tests if perl is not available

 + Implement 'git reset --patch'
 + builtin-add: refactor the meat of interactive_add()
 + Add a small patch-mode testing library
 + git-apply--interactive: Refactor patch mode code
 (this branch uses js/stash-dwim.)

There was a discussion on better DWIMmery for the above two topics to (1)
forbid "git stash save --anything-with-dash" and (2) redirect with any
option "git stash --opt" to "git stash save --opt", to keep it flexible
and safe at the same time.  I think it is a sane thing to do, but nothing
has happened lately.

* jn/gitweb-blame (2009-08-06) 3 commits
 - gitweb: Create links leading to 'blame_incremental' using JavaScript
 - gitweb: Incremental blame (WIP)
 - gitweb: Add optional "time to generate page" info in footer

Ajax-y blame WIP

 - Add support for "import" helper command
 - transport-helper_init(): fix a memory leak in error path
 - Add a config option for remotes to specify a foreign vcs

  (merged to 'next' on 2009-08-05 at 33d491e)

 + Use an external program to implement fetching with curl
 + Add support for external programs for handling native fetches
 (this branch is used by jh/cvs-helper.)

There was a discussion that suggests that the use of colon ':' before vcs
helper name needs to be corrected.  Nothing happened since.

* je/send-email-no-subject (2009-08-05) 1 commit
 - send-email: confirm on empty mail subjects

This seems to break t9001.  Near the tip of 'pu' I have a iffy
workaround.

* cc/sequencer-rebase-i (2009-08-21) 17 commits.
 - rebase -i: use "git sequencer--helper --cherry-pick"

Migrating "rebase -i" bit by bit to C.  I am inclined to agree with Dscho
that maybe this approach forces the migration to follow the structure of
the shell script too much, and could force a suboptimal end result, but
we'll see.

* aj/fix-read-tree-from-scratch (2009-08-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-08-20 at 7a04133)

  (merged to 'next' on 2009-08-22 at b3507bb)
 + git status: not "commit --dry-run" anymore
 + git stat -s: short status output
 + git stat: the beginning of "status that is not a dry-run of commit"
 (this branch uses jc/shortstatus.)

As promised, I squashed incremental "fix-up" into the commits they fix;
this will be kept in 'next' until 1.7.0

* jc/shortstatus (2009-08-15) 11 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-08-15 at 7e40766)

  (merged to 'next' on 2009-08-12 at 53bda17)
 + wt-status: collect untracked files in a separate "collect" phase
 + Make git_status_config() file scope static to builtin-commit.c
 + wt-status: move wt_status_colors[] into wt_status structure
 + wt-status: move many global settings to wt_status structure

  (merged to 'next' on 2009-08-20 at 671bea4)
 + git clone: Add --recursive to automatically checkout (nested) submodules

  (merged to 'next' on 2009-08-18 at f4a881d)

Will merge.

* jh/notes (2009-07-29) 8 commits.
 - t3302-notes-index-expensive: Speed up create_repo()
 - fast-import: Add support for importing commit notes
 - First draft of notes tree parser with support for fanout subtrees
 - Teach "-m <msg>" and "-F <file>" to "git notes edit"
 - Add an expensive test for git-notes
 - Speed up git notes lookup

The cvs-helper series depends on this one.

* ne/rev-cache (2009-08-21) 6 commits
 . support for path name caching in rev-cache
 . full integration of rev-cache into git, completed test suite
 . administrative functions for rev-cache, start of integration into git
 . support for non-commit object caching in rev-cache
 . basic revision cache system, no integration or features
 . man page and technical discussion for rev-cache

Updated but seems to break tests when merged to 'pu'; didn't look at the
issue deeply.

* jh/cvs-helper (2009-08-18) 7 commits
 - More fixes to the git-remote-cvs installation procedure
 - Fix the Makefile-generated path to the git_remote_cvs package in git-remote-cvs

 - 2/2: Add Python support library for CVS remote helper
 - 1/2: Add Python support library for CVS remote helper
 - Basic build infrastructure for Python scripts
 (this branch uses db/vcs-helper.)

Builds on db/vcs-helper.  The testing of Python part seemed to be
still fragile even with the latest fix on one of my boches with an
earlier round already installed, but I didn't look very deeply before
removing the older installation.

* nd/sparse (2009-08-20) 20 commits
 - sparse checkout: inhibit empty worktree
 - Add tests for sparse checkout
 - read-tree: add --no-sparse-checkout to disable sparse checkout support

 - unpack-trees(): add CE_WT_REMOVE to remove on worktree alone
 - Introduce "sparse checkout"
 - dir.c: export excluded_1() and add_excludes_from_file_1()
 - excluded_1(): support exclude files in index
 - unpack-trees(): carry skip-worktree bit over in merged_entry()
 - Read .gitignore from index if it is skip-worktree

 - update-index: refactor mark_valid() in preparation for new options
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-08-20 at ea167d7)
 + Prevent diff machinery from examining assume-unchanged entries on worktree

The first one was an independent fix; the rest has been replaced with the
"return of no-checkout" series.

* jc/1.7.0-diff-whitespace-only-status (2009-05-23) 2 commits.
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-08-02 at 9c08420)
 + diff: Rename QUIET internal option to QUICK
 + diff: change semantics of "ignore whitespace" options

For 1.7.0.  This changes exit code from "git diff --ignore-whitespace" and
friends when there is no actual output.  It is a backward incompatible
change, but we could argue that it is a bugfix.

* jc/1.7.0-push-safety (2009-02-09) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-08-02 at 38b82fe)
 + Refuse deleting the current branch via push
 + Refuse updating the current branch in a non-bare repository via push

For 1.7.0.

* jc/mailinfo-remove-brackets (2009-07-15) 1 commit.
 - mailinfo: -b option keeps [bracketed] strings that is not a [PATCH] marker
--------------------------------------------------
[I have been too busy to purge these]

 . git-merge-file: allow converting the results for the work tree

* lt/read-directory (2009-05-15) 3 commits.
 . Add initial support for pathname conversion to UTF-8
 . read_directory(): infrastructure for pathname character set conversion
 . Add 'fill_directory()' helper function for directory traversal

* ps/blame (2009-03-12) 1 commit.
 . blame.c: start libifying the blame infrastructure

* pb/tracking (2009-07-16) 7 commits.
 . branch.c: if remote is not config'd for branch, don't try delete push config
 . branch, checkout: introduce autosetuppush
 . move deletion of merge configuration to branch.c
 . remote: add per-remote autosetupmerge and autosetuprebase configuration
 . introduce a struct tracking_config
 . branch: install_branch_config and struct tracking refactoring
