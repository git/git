What's cooking in git.git (May 2023, #02; Fri, 5)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a future
release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and aren't
considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL to a
message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

Release tarballs are available at:

* fc/doc-drop-custom-callout-format (2023-05-03) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2023-05-04 at c2fd654367)
 + doc: remove custom callouts format

 Our custom callout formatter is no longer used in the documentation
 formatting toolchain, as the upstream default ones give better
 output these days.

 The titles of manual pages (formatted with AsciiDoc) used to be
 chomped at unreasonably short limit, which has been removed; this
 makes the formatted output match that of asciidoctor.

 - diff: fix interaction between the "-s" option and other options
 (this branch uses jc/dirstat-plug-leaks.)

 The "-s" (silent, squelch) option of the "diff" family of commands
 did not interact with other options that specify the output format
 well.  This has been cleaned up so that it will clear all the
 formatting options given before.

 setting pull.rebase=true, but these days pull.rebase=merges may be
 more inline with the original spirit of "rebuild your side on top
 of theirs".

 May want to discard.

 + parse_commit(): handle broken whitespace-only timestamp
 + parse_commit(): parse timestamp from end of line
 + t4212: avoid putting git on left-hand side of pipe

 author/committer ident.

* tb/pack-bitmap-traversal-with-boundary (2023-05-05) 2 commits
 - pack-bitmap.c: use commit boundary during bitmap traversal
 - pack-bitmap.c: extract `fill_in_bitmap()`

 The object traversal using reachability bitmap done by
 "pack-object" has been tweaked to take advantage of the fact that
 using "boundary" commits as representative of all the uninteresting
 ones can save quite a lot of object enumeration.

 Under discussion.
