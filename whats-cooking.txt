What's cooking in git.git (Jul 2019, #01; Wed, 3)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

The third batch of topics post 2.22 are now in 'master', and the tip
of 'next' has been rewound.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* bc/hash-independent-tests-part-4 (2019-07-01) 10 commits
 - t2203: avoid hard-coded object ID values
 - t1710: make hash independent
 - t1007: remove SHA1 prerequisites

 Update to the tests to help SHA-256 transition continues.


* pw/prompt-cherry-pick-revert-fix (2019-07-01) 1 commit
 - git-prompt: improve cherry-pick/revert detection

 When one step in multi step cherry-pick or revert is reset or
 committed, the command line prompt script failed to notice the
 current status, which has been improved.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* pw/rebase-progress-test-cleanup (2019-07-01) 1 commit
 - t3420: remove progress lines before comparing output
 (this branch uses sg/rebase-progress.)

 Test cleanup.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sg/git-C-empty-doc (2019-07-01) 1 commit
 - Document that 'git -C ""' works and doesn't change directory

 Doc update.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* es/local-atomic-push-failure-with-http (2019-07-02) 2 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - transport-helper: enforce atomic in push_refs_with_push

 "git push --atomic" that goes over the transport-helper (namely,
 the smart http transport) failed to prevent refs to be pushed when
 it can locally tell that one of the ref update will fail without
 having to consult the other end, which has been corrected.

 Need to either wait for reroll or squash the fix in directly.


* es/walken-tutorial (2019-07-02) 1 commit
 - documentation: add tutorial for revision walking

 Yet another revision walker tutorial.


* qn/clone-doc-use-long-form (2019-07-02) 2 commits
 - docs: git-clone: list short form of options first
 - docs: git-clone: refer to long form of options

 The "git clone" documentation refers to command line options in its
 description in the short form; they have been replaced with long
 forms to make them more recognisable.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sg/ci-brew-gcc-workaround (2019-07-03) 2 commits
 - ci: disable Homebrew's auto cleanup
 - ci: don't update Homebrew

 Dev support update.

[Stalled]

* jn/unknown-index-extensions (2018-11-21) 2 commits
 - index: offer advice for unknown index extensions
 - index: do not warn about unrecognized extensions

 A bit too alarming warning given when unknown index extensions
 exist is getting revamped.

 Expecting a reroll.


* jc/format-patch-delay-message-id (2019-04-05) 1 commit
 - format-patch: move message-id and related headers to the end

 The location "git format-patch --thread" adds the Message-Id:
 header in the series of header fields has been moved down, which
 may help working around a suspected bug in GMail MSA, reported at
 <CAHk-=whP1stFZNAaJiMi5eZ9rj0MRt20Y_yHVczZPH+O01d+sA@mail.gmail.com>

 Waiting for feedback to see if it truly helps.
 Needs tests.


* jt/fetch-cdn-offload (2019-03-12) 9 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - upload-pack: send part of packfile response as uri
 - fetch-pack: support more than one pack lockfile
 - upload-pack: refactor reading of pack-objects out
 - Documentation: add Packfile URIs design doc
 - Documentation: order protocol v2 sections
 - http-fetch: support fetching packfiles by URL
 - http: improve documentation of http_pack_request
 - http: use --stdin when getting dumb HTTP pack

 WIP for allowing a response to "git fetch" to instruct the bulk of
 the pack contents to be instead taken from elsewhere (aka CDN).

 Stalled


* js/protocol-advertise-multi (2018-12-28) 1 commit
 - protocol: advertise multiple supported versions

 The transport layer has been updated so that the protocol version
 used can be negotiated between the parties, by the initiator
 listing the protocol versions it is willing to talk, and the other
 side choosing from one of them.

 Expecting a reroll.

* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2018-10-15) 1 commit
 - zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".


* dl/remote-save-to-push (2018-12-11) 1 commit
 - remote: add --save-to-push option to git remote set-url

 "git remote set-url" learned a new option that moves existing value
 of the URL field to pushURL field of the remote before replacing
 the URL field with a new value.

 Anybody who wants to champion this topic?
 I am personally not yet quite convinced if this is worth pursuing.

* js/rebase-reschedule-applies-only-to-interactive (2019-07-01) 1 commit
 - rebase --am: ignore rebase.rescheduleFailedExec

 The configuration variable rebase.rescheduleFailedExec should be
 effective only while running an interactive rebase and should not
 affect anything when running an non-interactive one, which was not
 the case.  This has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jt/t5551-test-chunked (2019-06-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-07-03 at aafd74451c)

 - repack: disable bitmaps-by-default if .keep files exist

 Generation of pack bitmaps are now disabled when .keep files exist,
 as these are mutually exclusive features.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 - check_everything_connected: assume alternate ref tips are valid
 - object-store.h: move for_each_alternate_ref() from transport.h

 The tips of refs from the alternate object store can be used as
 starting point for reachability computation now.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 A test helper has been introduced to optimize preparation of test
 repositories with many simple commits, and a handful of test
 scripts have been updated to use it.

 Will merge to 'next'.
 I think I spotted one unused command, which we may want to remove, though.


* ab/test-env (2019-06-21) 8 commits
 - tests: make GIT_TEST_FAIL_PREREQS a boolean
 - tests: replace test_tristate with "git env--helper"

 - t6040 test: stop using global "script" variable
 - config.c: refactor die_bad_number() to not call gettext() early
 - env--helper: new undocumented builtin wrapping git_env_*()
 - config tests: simplify include cycle test

 Many GIT_TEST_* environment variables control various aspects of
 how our tests are run, but a few followed "non-empty is true, empty
 or unset is false" while others followed the usual "there are a few
 ways to spell true, like yes, on, etc., and also ways to spell
 false, like no, off, etc." convention.

 - repo-settings: pack.useSparse=true
 - repo-settings: use index.version=4 by default
 - repo-settings: create core.featureAdoptionRate setting

 A mechanism to enable newish configuration settings in bulk has
 been invented.

 The model may need to be rethought.  A linear scale with "early
 adoption" mindset may not match diverse use cases of the tool.

 The codepath to compute delta islands used to spew progress output
 without giving the callers any way to squelch it, which has been
 fixed.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 + fetch-pack: print server version at the top in -v -v
 + fetch-pack: print all relevant supported capabilities with -v -v
 + fetch-pack: move capability names out of i18n strings

 Protocol capabilities that go over wire should never be translated,
 but it was incorrectly marked for translation, which has been
 corrected.  The output of protocol capabilities for debugging has
 been tweaked a bit.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 "ls-files" learned "--debug-json" option to dump the contents and
 the extensions of the index file.

 At least the fixup at the tip needs to be squashed into the right
 commit.

 Retire use of kwset library, which is an optimization for looking
 for fixed strings, with use of pcre2 JIT.

 On hold.

 Will merge to 'master'.
 The 'kwset' one may get a wholesale replacement, either with new
 version of kwset from upstream or removal of its users, but in the
 meantime, it is probably OK to merge it down.

  (merged to 'next' on 2019-06-26 at 86b60f2631)
 + packfile: rename close_all_packs to close_object_store
 + packfile: close commit-graph in close_all_packs
 + commit-graph: use raw_object_store when closing
 (this branch is used by ds/commit-graph-incremental; uses ds/commit-graph-write-refactor.)

 The commit-graph file is now part of the "files that the runtime
 may keep open file descriptors on, all of which would need to be
 closed when done with the object store", and the file descriptor to
 an existing commit-graph file now is closed before "gc" finalizes a
 new instance to replace it.

 "git rebase --abort" used to leave refs/rewritten/ when concluding
 "git rebase -r", which has been corrected.

 + branch: add worktree info on verbose output
 + branch: update output to include worktree info
 + ref-filter: add worktreepath atom

 "git branch --list" learned to show branches that are checked out
 in other worktrees connected to the same repository prefixed with
 '+', similar to the way the currently checked out branch is shown
 with '*' in front.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* cc/multi-promisor (2019-06-25) 15 commits
 - Move core_partial_clone_filter_default to promisor-remote.c

 - promisor-remote: implement promisor_remote_get_direct()
 - Add initial support for many promisor remotes
 - fetch-object: make functions return an error code

 Teach the lazy clone machinery that there can be more than one
 promisor remote and consult them in order when downloading missing
 objects on demand.

 There is a bit of interaction with md/list-objects-filter-combo
 topic, whose conflict resolution I have no confidence in X-<.
 Extra sets of eyes are appreciated.

 (this branch is used by jl/status-reduce-vertical-blank.)

 Two new commands "git switch" and "git restore" are introduced to
 split "checking out a branch to work on advancing its history" and
 "checking out paths out of the index and/or a tree-ish to work on
 advancing the current history" out of the single "git checkout"
 command.

* jc/format-patch-noclobber (2019-02-22) 1 commit
 - format-patch: --no-clobber refrains from overwriting output files

 "git format-patch" used to overwrite an existing patch/cover-letter
 file.  A new "--no-clobber" option stops it.

 Undecided but inclined to discard.

* dl/rebase-i-keep-base (2019-04-25) 6 commits
 - rebase: teach rebase --keep-base

 - rebase: fast-forward --onto in more cases
 - rebase: refactor can_fast_forward into goto tower
 - t3432: test rebase fast-forward behavior
 - t3431: add rebase --fork-point tests

 "git rebase --keep-base <upstream>" tries to find the original base
 of the topic being rebased and rebase on top of that same base,
 which is useful when running the "git rebase -i" (and its limited
 variant "git rebase -x").

 The command also has learned to fast-forward in more cases where it
 can instead of replaying to recreate identical commits.

 On hold.
