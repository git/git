What's cooking in git.git (Jan 2022, #03; Thu, 13)
--------------------------------------------------

There are a few "oops, what we merged recently is broken" topics
that still are not in 'master', but otherwise what we have should
be pretty much what we'll have in the final one.

 - I am reasonably happy with ab/refs-errno-cleanup (just one patch)
   that fixes the incorrect state of the code left by the earlier
   parts of the topic that have already been merged during this
   cycle.

 - I am also OK with ab/reftable-build-fixes (two patches), one for
   general type correctness fix, the other for helping older sub-C99
   compilers.

If there are fixes for regressions that we introduced during this
cycle other than these two topics, I certainly am missing them, so
please holler loudly and quickly, hopefully in time for me to tag
the -rc1 tomorrow.

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen',
which means nothing more than that I have found them of interest for
some reason (like "it may have hard-to-resolve conflicts with
another topic already in flight" or "this may turn out to be
useful").  Do not read too much into a topic being in (or not in)
'seen'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of the
integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/

 implementation also made "git stash -h" to show short help only for
 "git stash push", which has been corrected.

 that logically removes one ref may end up invoking ref-transaction
 hook twice, which has been corrected.

 "git fetch --nogotiate-only" is an internal command used by "git
 push" to figure out which part of our history is missing from the
 other side.  It should never recurse into submodules even when
 fetch.recursesubmodules configuration variable is set, nor it
 should trigger "gc".  The code has been tightened up to ensure it
 only does common ancestry discovery and nothing else.

 When the http-backend program, which is the server-side component
 for the smart HTTP transport, sends a "404 Not found" error, we
 deliberately did not say anything to the requesting client.  We now
 send a message back to the browser to tell the user that they do
 not want to visit the URL via their browser, instead of a totally
 blank page.
