What's cooking in git.git (May 2017, #07; Tue, 23)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

The 'maint' branch is now for the v2.13.x maintenance track.  A
handful of fixes in 'master' will soon be merged to it to prepare
for v2.13.1 in a week or so.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

* ab/doc-replace-gmane-links (2017-05-09) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-05-20 at 2c4f96560c)
 + doc: replace more gmane links
 + doc: replace a couple of broken gmane links

 The Web interface to gmane news archive is long gone, even though
 the articles are still accessible via NTTP.  Replace the links with
 ones to public-inbox.org.  Because their message identification is
 based on the actual message-id, it is likely that it will be easier
 to migrate away from it if/when necessary.


* ab/fix-poison-tests (2017-05-11) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-05-20 at 5b13ba86bd)
 + travis-ci: add job to run tests with GETTEXT_POISON
 + travis-ci: setup "prove cache" in "script" step
 + tests: fix tests broken under GETTEXT_POISON=YesPlease

 Update tests to pass under GETTEXT_POISON (a mechanism to ensure
 that output strings that should not be translated are not
 translated by mistake), and tell TravisCI to run them.


* ah/log-decorate-default-to-auto (2017-05-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-05-20 at 209614479c)
 + builtin/log: honor log.decorate

 Setting "log.decorate=false" in the configuration file did not take
 effect in v2.13, which has been corrected.


* bw/submodule-with-bs-path (2017-05-01) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-05-20 at b740f784cb)
 + t7400: add !CYGWIN prerequisite to 'add with \\ in path'

 A hotfix to a topic that is already in v2.13.


* jt/push-options-doc (2017-05-10) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-05-20 at ca7f344111)
 + receive-pack: verify push options in cert
 + docs: correct receive.advertisePushOptions default

 The receive-pack program now makes sure that the push certificate
 records the same set of push options used for pushing.


* ls/travis-relays-for-windows-ci (2017-05-04) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-05-20 at 47f34b78e2)
 + travis-ci: retry if Git for Windows CI returns HTTP error 502 or 503
 + travis-ci: handle Git for Windows CI status "failed" explicitly

 Will merge to 'master'.


* rs/checkout-am-fix-unborn (2017-05-08) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-05-20 at d4f1ee3ed7)
 + am: check return value of resolve_refdup before using hash
 + checkout: check return value of resolve_refdup before using hash

 A few codepaths in "checkout" and "am" working on an unborn branch
 tried to access an uninitialized piece of memory.


* tb/dedup-crlf-tests (2017-05-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-05-20 at 0a7ffff154)

* ah/doc-interpret-trailers-ifexists (2017-05-23) 1 commit
 - Documentation: fix reference to ifExists for interpret-trailers

 Documentation fix.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ah/doc-pretty-format-fix (2017-05-23) 1 commit

 Documentation fix.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sb/submodule-blanket-recursive (2017-05-23) 6 commits
 . builtin/push.c: respect 'submodule.recurse' option
 . builtin/grep.c: respect 'submodule.recurse' option
 . builtin/fetch.c: respect 'submodule.recurse' option
 . Introduce submodule.recurse option for worktree manipulators
 . submodule test invocation: only pass additional arguments
 . submodule.c: add has_submodules to check if we have any submodules
 (this branch uses sb/reset-recurse-submodules.)

 A new configuration variable "submodule.recurse" can be set to true
 to force various commands run at the top-level superproject to
 behave as if they were invoked with the "--recurse-submodules"
 option.

 Seems to break t7814 when merged to 'pu'.


* sb/t5531-update-desc (2017-05-23) 1 commit
 - t5531: fix test description

 The description strings for a few tests have been updated.

[Stalled]

* mg/status-in-progress-info (2017-05-10) 2 commits
 - status --short --inprogress: spell it as --in-progress
 - status: show in-progress info for short status

 "git status" learns an option to report various operations
 (e.g. "merging") that the user is in the middle of.

 cf. <xmqqmvakcdqw.fsf@gitster.mtv.corp.google.com>


* mg/name-rev-debug (2017-03-31) 2 commits
 - describe: pass --debug down to name-rev
 - name-rev: provide debug output
 (this branch uses jc/name-rev-lw-tag.)

 "git describe --debug --contains" did not add any meaningful
 information, even though without "--contains" it did.


* nd/worktree-move (2017-04-20) 6 commits
 - worktree remove: new command
 - worktree move: refuse to move worktrees with submodules
 - worktree move: accept destination as directory
 - worktree move: new command
 - worktree.c: add update_worktree_location()
 - worktree.c: add validate_worktree()

 "git worktree" learned move and remove subcommands.

 - remove_subtree(): reimplement using iterators
 - dir_iterator: rewrite state machine model
 - dir_iterator: refactor dir_iterator_advance
 - remove_subtree(): test removing nested directories
 - dir_iterator: add tests for dir_iterator API

 Update the dir-iterator API and use it to reimplement
 remove_subtree().

 A reroll exists that is based on the updated 'master', but I ran
 out of time trying to get it to work with other topics in flight
 in 'pu'.

* ab/conditional-config-with-symlinks (2017-05-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-05-23 at 6162222c2e)
 + config: match both symlink & realpath versions in IncludeIf.gitdir:*

 The recently introduced "[includeIf "gitdir:$dir"] path=..."
 mechansim has further been taught to take symlinks into account.
 The directory "$dir" specified in "gitdir:$dir" may be a symlink to
 a real location, not something that $(getcwd) may return.  In such
 a case, a realpath of "$dir" is compared with the real path of the
 current repository to determine if the contents from the named path
 should be included.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* bm/interpret-trailers-cut-line-is-eom (2017-05-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-05-23 at 3e5ff08517)
 + interpret-trailers: honor the cut line

 "git interpret-trailers", when used as GIT_EDITOR for "git commit
 -v", looked for and appended to a trailer block at the very end,
 i.e. at the end of the "diff" output.  The command has been
 corrected to pay attention to the cut-mark line "commit -v" adds to
 the buffer---the real trailer block should appear just before it.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/skip-test-in-the-middle (2017-05-18) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-05-23 at 6c962b353b)
 + t5545: enhance test coverage when no http server is installed
 + test: allow skipping the remainder

 A recent update to t5545-push-options.sh started skipping all the
 tests in the script when a web server testing is disabled or
 unavailable, not just the ones that require a web server.  Non HTTP
 tests have been salvaged to always run in this script.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/alternate-ref-optim (2017-05-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-05-23 at 4b4b3ac463)
 + t5400: avoid concurrent writes into a trace file

 A test allowed both "git push" and "git receive-pack" on the other
 end write their traces into the same file.  This is OK on platforms
 that allows atomically appending to a file opened with O_APPEND,
 but on other platforms led to a mangled output, causing
 intermittent test failures.  This has been fixed by disabling
 traces from "receive-pack" in the test.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* mh/packed-ref-store-prep (2017-05-23) 26 commits
 - cache_ref_iterator_begin(): avoid priming unneeded directories
 - ref-filter: limit traversal to prefix
 - create_ref_entry(): remove `check_name` option
 - refs_ref_iterator_begin(): handle `GIT_REF_PARANOIA`
 - read_packed_refs(): report unexpected fopen() failures

 - get_packed_ref_cache(): assume "packed-refs" won't change while locked
 - should_pack_ref(): new function, extracted from `files_pack_refs()`
 - ref_update_reject_duplicates(): add a sanity check
 - ref_update_reject_duplicates(): use `size_t` rather than `int`
 - ref_update_reject_duplicates(): expose function to whole refs module
 - ref_transaction_prepare(): new optional step for reference updates
 - ref_transaction_commit(): check for valid `transaction->state`
 - files_transaction_cleanup(): new helper function
 - files_ref_store: put the packed files lock directly in this struct
 - files-backend: move `lock` member to `files_ref_store`
 - lockfile: add a new method, is_lock_file_locked()
 - ref_store: take a `msg` parameter when deleting references
 - refs: use `size_t` indexes when iterating over ref transaction updates
 - refs_ref_iterator_begin(): don't check prefixes redundantly
 - prefix_ref_iterator: don't trim too much
 - files-backend: use `die("BUG: ...")`, not `die("internal error: ...")`
 - ref_iterator_begin_fn(): fix docstring
 - refs.h: clarify docstring for the ref_transaction_update()-related fns
 - t3600: clean up permissions test properly
 - Merge branch 'bc/object-id'
 (this branch uses bc/object-id.)

 The implementation of "ref" API around the "packed refs" have been
 cleaned up, in preparation for further changes.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sl/clean-d-ignored-fix (2017-05-22) 7 commits
 - SQUASH????
 - clean: teach clean -d to skip dirs containing ignored files
 - dir: expose cmp_name() and check_contains()
 - dir: hide untracked contents of untracked dirs
 - dir: recurse into untracked dirs for ignored files
 - t7061: status --ignored should search untracked dirs
 - t7300: clean -d should skip dirs with ignored files

 "git clean -d" used to clean directories that has ignored files,
 even though the command should not lose ignored ones without "-x".
 This has been corrected.

 Expecting a reroll.

* tg/stash-push-fixup (2017-05-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-05-23 at 338eb650f2)
 + completion: add git stash push

 The shell completion script (in contrib/) learned "git stash" has
 a new "push" subcommand.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ab/sha1dc (2017-05-22) 3 commits
 - sha1collisiondetection: automatically enable when submodule is populated
 - sha1dc: optionally use sha1collisiondetection as a submodule
 - sha1dc: update from upstream

 The "collission-detecting" implementation of SHA-1 hash we borrowed
 from is replaced by directly binding the upstream project as our
 submodule.

 Will keep in 'pu' for a few CI cycles.
 Impact to the various build and release infrastructure of using
 submodule is not yet fully known, but this lets us dip our toes.


* bp/fsmonitor (2017-05-21) 10 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - SQUASH???
 - SQUASH???
 - fsmonitor: add a sample query-fsmonitor hook script for Watchman
 - fsmonitor: add documentation for the fsmonitor extension.
 - fsmonitor: add test cases for fsmonitor extension
 - SQUASH???
 - fsmonitor: teach git to optionally utilize a file system monitor to speed up detecting new or changed files.
 - dir: make lookup_untracked() available outside of dir.c
 - bswap: add 64 bit endianness helper get_be64

 Expecting a reroll.


* dk/send-email-avoid-net-smtp-ssl-when-able (2017-05-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-05-23 at fc59b8a1d4)
 + send-email: Net::SMTP::SSL is obsolete, use only when necessary

 "git send-email" now uses Net::SMTP::SSL, which is obsolete, only
 when needed.  Recent versions of Net::SMTP can do TLS natively.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/name-rev-lw-tag (2017-03-29) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-05-23 at 3f88b6d73c)
 + name-rev: favor describing with tags and use committer date to tiebreak
 + name-rev: refactor logic to see if a new candidate is a better name
 (this branch is used by mg/name-rev-debug.)

 "git describe --contains" penalized light-weight tags so much that
 they were almost never considered.  Instead, give them about the
 same chance to be considered as an annotated tag that is the same
 age as the underlying commit would.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/diff-blob (2017-05-20) 15 commits
 - diff: use blob path for blob/file diffs
 - diff: use pending "path" if it is available
 - diff: use the word "path" instead of "name" for blobs
 - diff: pass whole pending entry in blobinfo
 - handle_revision_arg: record paths for pending objects
 - handle_revision_arg: record modes for "a..b" endpoints
 - t4063: add tests of direct blob diffs
 - get_sha1_with_context: dynamically allocate oc->path
 - get_sha1_with_context: always initialize oc->symlink_path
 - sha1_name: consistently refer to object_context as "oc"
 - handle_revision_arg: add handle_dotdot() helper
 - handle_revision_arg: hoist ".." check out of range parsing
 - handle_revision_arg: stop using "dotdot" as a generic pointer
 - handle_revision_arg: simplify commit reference lookups
 - handle_revision_arg: reset "dotdot" consistently

 The result from "git diff" that compares two blobs, e.g. "git diff
 $commit1:$path $commit2:$path", used to be shown with the full
 object name as given on the command line, but it is more natural to
 use the $path in the output and use it to look up .gitattributes.

 Needs review.


* jk/ignore-broken-tags-when-ignoring-missing-links (2017-05-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-05-23 at 977491e52a)
 + revision.c: ignore broken tags with ignore_missing_links

 Tag objects, which are not reachable from any ref, that point at
 missing objects were mishandled by "git gc" and friends (they
 should silently be ignored instead)

 Will merge to 'master'.


* js/bs-is-a-dir-sep-on-windows (2017-05-20) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-05-23 at e27040ceb0)
 + Windows: do not treat a path with backslashes as a remote's nick name
 + mingw.h: permit arguments with side effects for is_dir_sep

 "foo\bar\baz" in "git fetch foo\bar\baz", even though there is no
 slashes in it, cannot be a nickname for a remote on Windows, as
 that is likely to be a pathname on a local filesystem.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* js/larger-timestamps (2017-05-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-05-23 at 16f7c9e677)

* kn/ref-filter-branch-list (2017-05-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-05-23 at e0cc721af0)
 + ref-filter: resolve HEAD when parsing %(HEAD) atom

 "git for-each-ref --format=..." with %(HEAD) in the format used to
 resolve the HEAD symref as many times as it had processed refs,
 which was wasteful, and "git branch" shared the same problem.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* pw/rebase-i-regression-fix (2017-05-20) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-05-23 at 14676d0013)

 . diff: introduce more flexible emit function
 . diff.c: factor out diff_flush_patch_all_file_pairs
 . diff: move line ending check into emit_hunk_header
 . diff: readability fix

 "git diff" has been taught to optionally paint new lines that are
 the same as deleted lines elsewhere differently from genuinely new
 lines.

 The internal logic used in "git blame" has been libified to make it
 easier to use by cgit.

 RFC, and is hard to review due to renaming of symbols and moving of
 lines across files are intermixed but I think the overall direction
 is a good one.

 Expecting a rerolled non-RFC series.

 "git read-tree -m" (no tree-ish) gave a nonsense suggestion "use
 --empty if you want to clear the index".  With "-m", such a request
 will still fail anyway, as you'd need to name at least one tree-ish
 to be merged.

* dt/unpack-save-untracked-cache-extension (2017-05-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-05-23 at 3196d093d6)
 + unpack-trees: preserve index extensions

 When "git checkout", "git merge", etc. manipulates the in-core
 index, various pieces of information in the index extensions are
 discarded from the original state, as it is usually not the case
 that they are kept up-to-date and in-sync with the operation on the
 main index.  The untracked cache extension is copied across these
 operations now, which would speed up "git status" (as long as the
 cache is properly invalidated).

* sg/clone-refspec-from-command-line-config (2017-05-16) 4 commits
 - clone: use free_refspec() to free refspec list
 - remote: drop free_refspecs() function
 - Documentation/clone: document ignored configuration variables
 - clone: respect additional configured fetch refspecs during initial fetch

 "git clone -c var=val" is a way to set configuration variables in
 the resulting repository, but it is more useful to also make these
 variables take effect while the initial clone is happening,
 e.g. these configuration variables could be fetch refspecs.

 Waiting for response.

 + t5310: fix "; do" style
 + pack-objects: disable pack reuse for object-selection options

 "pack-objects" can stream a slice of an existing packfile out when
 the pack bitmap can tell that the reachable objects are all needed
 in the output, without inspecting individual objects.  This
 strategy however would not work well when "--local" and other
 options are in use, and need to be disabled.

 Make sure our tests would pass when the sources are checked out
 with "platform native" line ending convention by default on
 Windows.  Some "text" files out tests use and the test scripts
 themselves that are meant to be run with /bin/sh, ought to be
 checked out with eol=LF even on Windows.

 of other worktrees as the root for reachability traversal, making
 objects that are in use only in other worktrees to be subject to
 garbage collection.
