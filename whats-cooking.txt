Subject: What's cooking in git.git (Apr 2020, #03; Tue, 28)
X-master-at: 86ab15cb154862b6fa5cc646dac27532f881e1fb

What's cooking in git.git (Apr 2020, #03; Tue, 28)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

Quite a few topics have been merged to 'next' and also to 'master'.
There are a few more important topics that need to be merged down to
'master' before we're comfortable cutting the next maintenance
update but hopefully we'd get there during this week.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

* dl/libify-a-few (2020-03-24) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-20 at 84eb704a32)
 + Lib-ify prune-packed
 + Lib-ify fmt-merge-msg

 Code in builtin/*, i.e. those can only be called from within

  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-20 at 601e10f9a1)
 + doc: --recurse-submodules mostly applies to active submodules
 + doc: be more precise on (fetch|push).recurseSubmodules

* dr/midx-avoid-int-underflow (2020-03-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-15 at eb2343a5eb)
 + midx.c: fix an integer underflow

 When fed a midx that records no objects, some codepaths tried to
 loop from 0 through (num_objects-1), which, due to integer
 arithmetic wrapping around, made it nonsense operation with out of
 bounds array accesses.  The code has been corrected to reject such
 an midx file.


* ds/commit-graph-expiry-fix (2020-04-01) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-20 at 4afb3de947)
 + commit-graph: fix buggy --expire-time option

 "git commit-graph write --expire-time=<timestamp>" did not use the

 Doc update.


* ds/log-exclude-decoration-config (2020-04-16) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-22 at 7dc5fae7d9)
 + log: add log.excludeDecoration config option
 + log-tree: make ref_filter_match() a helper method

 The "--decorate-refs" and "--decorate-refs-exclude" options "git
 log" takes have learned a companion configuration variable
 log.excludeDecoration that sits at the lowest priority in the
 family.


* ds/revision-show-pulls (2020-04-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-15 at 89b4d86a3a)
 + revision: --show-pulls adds helpful merges

 "git log" learned "--show-pulls" that helps pathspec limited
 history views; a merge commit that takes the whole change from a
 side branch, which is normally omitted from the output, is shown
 in addition to the commits that introduce real changes.


* ds/t5319-touch-fix (2020-04-01) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-20 at 41ccdb3fcd)
 + t5319: replace 'touch -m' with 'test-tool chmtime'

 Tests update to use "test-chmtime" instead of "touch -t".


* eb/format-patch-no-encode-headers (2020-04-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-15 at 368840cd6c)
 + format-patch: teach --no-encode-email-headers

 The output from "git format-patch" uses RFC 2047 encoding for
 non-ASCII letters on From: and Subject: headers, so that it can
 directly be fed to e-mail programs.  A new option has been added
 to produce these headers in raw.


* eb/mboxrd-doc (2020-04-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-22 at 8935542c17)

  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-15 at 3aa725ff45)
 + pull: avoid running both merge and rebase

 "git pull --rebase" tried to run a rebase even after noticing that
 the pull results in a fast-forward and no rebase is needed nor
 sensible, for the past few years due to a mistake nobody noticed.


* en/rebase-doc-hooks-called-by-accident (2020-04-05) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-20 at 1011f8a876)
 + git-rebase.txt: add another hook to the hooks section, and explain more

 "git rebase" happens to call some hooks meant for "checkout" and
 "commit" by this was not a designed behaviour than historical
 accident.  This has been documented.


* en/rebase-no-keep-empty (2020-04-11) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-15 at 9908cee7c0)
 + rebase: fix an incompatible-options error message
 + rebase: reinstate --no-keep-empty
 + rebase -i: mark commits that begin empty in todo editor
 (this branch is used by jt/rebase-allow-duplicate.)

 "git rebase" (again) learns to honor "--no-keep-empty", which lets
 the user to discard commits that are empty from the beginning (as
 opposed to the ones that become empty because of rebasing).  The
 interactive rebase also marks commits that are empty in the todo.


* en/sequencer-reflog-action (2020-04-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-15 at 6c635bdaa1)
 + sequencer: honor GIT_REFLOG_ACTION

 "git rebase -i" did not leave the reflog entries correctly.


* jc/allow-strlen-substitution-in-shell-scripts (2020-03-29) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-15 at 262424efdc)
 + CodingGuidelines: allow ${#posix} == strlen($posix)

 Coding guideline update.

  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-20 at 4bd94585d1)
 + t/README: suggest how to leave test early with failure

 Document the recommended way to abort a failing test early (e.g. by
 exiting a loop), which is to say "return 1".


* jc/gnu-hurd-lets-fread-read-dirs (2020-04-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-22 at 8cd50b8150)
 + config.mak.uname: Define FREAD_READS_DIRECTORIES for GNU/Hurd

 GNU/Hurd is also among the ones that need the fopen() wrapper.


* jc/log-no-mailmap (2020-03-16) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-20 at b43968e73e)
 + log: give --[no-]use-mailmap a more sensible synonym --[no-]mailmap
 + clone: reorder --recursive/--recurse-submodules
 + parse-options: teach "git cmd -h" to show alias as alias

 "git log" learns "--[no-]mailmap" as a synonym to "--[no-]use-mailmap"


* jc/missing-ref-store-fix (2020-04-09) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-15 at 83caf48c7a)
 + repository: mark the "refs" pointer as private
 + sha1-name: do not assume that the ref store is initialized

 We've left the command line parsing of "git log :/a/b/" broken for
 about a full year without anybody noticing, which has been
 corrected.


* jk/config-use-size-t (2020-04-10) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-20 at 4af9fea74f)
 + config: reject parsing of files over INT_MAX
 + config: use size_t to store parsed variable baselen
 + git_config_parse_key(): return baselen as size_t
 + config: drop useless length variable in write_pair()
 + parse_config_key(): return subsection len as size_t
 + remote: drop auto-strlen behavior of make_branch() and make_rewrite()

 The config API made mixed uses of int and size_t types to represent
 length of various pieces of text it parsed, which has been updated
 to use the correct type (i.e. size_t) throughout.


* jk/credential-parsing-end-of-host-in-URL (2020-04-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-15 at 55bc3eb7cb)
 + credential: treat "?" and "#" in URLs as end of host

 Parsing of URL for the credential helper has been corrected.

  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-20 at 76e8908efe)
 + fast-import: replace custom hash with hashmap.c

 The custom hash function used by "git fast-import" has been
 replaced with the one from hashmap.c, which gave us a nice
 performance boost.


* jk/harden-protocol-v2-delim-handling (2020-03-29) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-15 at c983535405)
 + test-lib-functions: simplify packetize() stdin code
 + upload-pack: handle unexpected delim packets
 + test-lib-functions: make packetize() more efficient

 The server-end of the v2 protocol to serve "git clone" and "git
 fetch" was not prepared to see a delim packets at unexpected
 places, which led to a crash.


* jk/oid-array-cleanups (2020-03-30) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-15 at d6155cd023)

  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-15 at 11d6110e99)
 + clone: use "quick" lookup while following tags

 The logic to auto-follow tags by "git clone --single-branch" was
 not careful to avoid lazy-fetching unnecessary tags, which has been
 corrected.


* jm/gitweb-fastcgi-utf8 (2020-03-29) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-15 at adb7f2373a)

 + Revert "fetch: default to protocol version 2"

 Those fetching over protocol v2 from linux-next and other kernel
 repositories are reporting that v2 often fetches way too much than
 needed.


* js/flush-prompt-before-interative-input (2020-04-10) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-15 at 051407eb3a)
 + interactive: explicitly `fflush` stdout before expecting input
 + interactive: refactor code asking the user for interactive input

 The interactive input from various codepaths are consolidated and
 any prompt possibly issued earlier are fflush()ed before we read.


* js/import-tars-do-not-make-phony-files-from-pax-headers (2020-03-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-15 at 408afae2c9)
 + import-tars: ignore the global PAX header

 The import-tars importer (in contrib/fast-import/) used to create
 phony files at the top-level of the repository when the archive
 contains global PAX headers, which made its own logic to detect and
 omit the common leading directory ineffective, which has been
 corrected.


* js/mingw-fixes (2020-04-10) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-15 at 11a3d39d2b)

  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-20 at 435bf60bd5)
 + stash -p: (partially) fix bug concerning split hunks
 + t3904: fix incorrect demonstration of a bug

 Allowing the user to split a patch hunk while "git stash -p" does
 not work well; a band-aid has been added to make this (partially)
 work better.

 lazily on-demand from promisor remote repositories.


* jt/rebase-allow-duplicate (2020-04-11) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-15 at 56a9d83adf)
 + rebase --merge: optionally skip upstreamed commits
 (this branch uses en/rebase-no-keep-empty.)

 Allow "git rebase" to reapply all local commits, even if the may be
 already in the upstream, without checking first.


* jx/atomic-push (2020-04-17) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-20 at 266d6934d8)
 + transport-helper: new method reject_atomic_push()
 + transport-helper: mark failure for atomic push
 + send-pack: mark failure of atomic push properly
 + t5543: never report what we do not push

  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-20 at c18cd924c9)
 + git-submodule.sh: setup uninitialized variables

 The "git submodule" command did not initialize a few variables it
 internally uses and was affected by variable settings leaked from

  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-22 at 55cf00e322)
 + grep: follow conventions for printing paths w/ unusual chars

  (merged to 'next' on 2020-03-31 at 2183baf09c)
 + builtin/commit-graph.c: support '--input=graphed'
 + builtin/commit-graph.c: introduce '--input=<source>'
 + builtin/commit-graph.c: support '--split[=<strategy>]'

 The code to write out the commit-graph has been taught a few
 options to control if the resulting graph chains should be merged
 or a single new incremental graph is created.

 Discarded---tb/commit-graph-split-strategy supersedes this.
