What's cooking in git.git (Sep 2023, #01; Fri, 1)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and
aren't considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL
to a message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity (of course they can be resubmit when new interests
arise).

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

Release tarballs are available at:

  (merged to 'next' on 2023-09-01 at ad87c89ee3)
 + format-patch: --rfc honors what --subject-prefix sets

 "git format-patch --rfc --subject-prefix=<foo>" used to ignore the
 "--subject-prefix" option and used "[RFC PATCH]"; now we will add
 "RFC" prefix to whatever subject prefix is specified.

 This is a backward compatible change that may deserve a note.

  (merged to 'next' on 2023-08-29 at 5466f7fcb2)

 It may be tempting to leave the help text NULL for a command line
 option that is either hidden or too obvious, but "git subcmd -h"
 and "git subcmd --help-all" would have segfaulted if done so.  Now
 the help text is optional.

 - resolve-undo: allow resurrecting conflicted state that resolved to deletion
 - update-index: do not read HEAD and MERGE_HEAD unconditionally
 (this branch is used by jc/rerere-cleanup.)

 "checkout --merge -- path" and "update-index --unresolve path" did
 not resurrect conflicted state that was resolved to remove path,
 but now they do.

 Needs review.

 - status: fix branch shown when not only bisecting

 "git status" is taught to show both the branch being bisected and
 being rebased when both are in effect at the same time.

 Needs review.

 + commit-graph: fix small leak with invalid changedPathsVersion
  (merged to 'next' on 2023-08-03 at d99958c287)
 + commit-graph: new filter ver. that fixes murmur3
 + repo-settings: introduce commitgraph.changedPathsVersion
 + t4216: test changed path filters with high bit paths
 + t/helper/test-read-graph: implement `bloom-filters` mode
 + bloom.h: make `load_bloom_filter_from_graph()` public
 + t/helper/test-read-graph.c: extract `dump_graph_info()`
 + gitformat-commit-graph: describe version 2 of BDAT

 The Bloom filter used for path limited history traversal was broken
 on systems whose "char" is unsigned; update the implementation and
 bump the format version to 2.

 Reverted out of 'next', superseded by the tb/path-filter-fix topic.

 "git send-email" exits with non-zero status when end-user

 Breaks existing users without even an opt-out knob.
