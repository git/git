What's cooking in git.git (Nov 2012, #01; Sun, 4)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.

The third batch of topics has graduated to master.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches of
my repository at:

  git://github.com/peff/git.git

Until Junio returns, kernel.org and the other "usual" places will not be
updated.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* as/maint-doc-fix-no-post-rewrite (2012-11-02) 1 commit

 - remote-bzr: add simple tests
 - remote-bzr: add support for pushing
 - Add new remote-bzr transport helper

 New remote helper for bzr.


* fc/remote-hg (2012-11-04) 16 commits
 - remote-hg: the author email can be null
 - remote-hg: add option to not track branches
 - remote-hg: add extra author test
 - remote-hg: add tests to compare with hg-git
 - remote-hg: add bidirectional tests
 - test-lib: avoid full path to store test results
 - remote-hg: add basic tests
 - remote-hg: fake bookmark when there's none
 - remote-hg: add compat for hg-git author fixes
 - remote-hg: add support for hg-git compat mode

 - Add new remote-hg transport helper

 New remote helper for hg.

 May want to do one more round of review on the list.

 Most of the discussion so far has been on whether to pursue this versus
 what's in msysgit, and not on the specifics of the code. I'd like to
 put this in next soon, but it probably makes sense for everybody to
 give it a final look-over.


* jk/maint-http-half-auth-fetch (2012-10-31) 2 commits
 - remote-curl: retry failed requests for auth even with gzip
 - remote-curl: hoist gzip buffer size to top of post_rpc

 Fixes fetch from servers that ask for auth only during the actual
 packing phase. This is not really a recommended configuration, but it
 cleans up the code at the same time.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* js/hp-nonstop (2012-10-30) 1 commit
 - fix 'make test' for HP NonStop

 Will merge to 'next'.


* kb/preload-index-more (2012-11-02) 1 commit
 - update-index/diff-index: use core.preloadindex to improve performance

 Use preloadindex in more places, which has a nice speedup on systems
 with slow stat calls (and even on Linux).

 Will merge to 'next'.


* mh/notes-string-list (2012-11-04) 5 commits
 - string_list_add_refs_from_colon_sep(): use string_list_split()
 - notes: fix handling of colon-separated values
 - combine_notes_cat_sort_uniq(): sort and dedup lines all at once
 - Initialize sort_uniq_list using named constant
 - string_list: add a function string_list_remove_empty_items()

 Improve the asymptotic performance of the cat_sort_uniq notes merge
 strategy.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* mh/strbuf-split (2012-11-04) 4 commits
 - strbuf_split*(): document functions
 - strbuf_split*(): rename "delim" parameter to "terminator"
 - strbuf_split_buf(): simplify iteration
 - strbuf_split_buf(): use ALLOC_GROW()

 Cleanups and documentation for strbuf_split.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* mm/maint-doc-commit-edit (2012-11-02) 1 commit

  (merged to 'next' on 2012-10-25 at 80f1592)
 + Documentation: remote tracking branch -> remote-tracking branch

 We long ago hyphenated "remote-tracking branch"; this
 catches some new instances added since then.

 Will merge to 'master' in the third batch.


* ph/pull-rebase-detached (2012-10-25) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-10-25 at 73d9d14)

  (merged to 'next' on 2012-10-29 at af52cef)
 + Teach git-completion about git p4

 Comment from Pete will need to be addressed in a follow-up patch.


* as/test-tweaks (2012-09-20) 7 commits
 - tests: paint unexpectedly fixed known breakages in bold red
 - tests: test the test framework more thoroughly
 - [SQUASH] t/t0000-basic.sh: quoting of TEST_DIRECTORY is screwed up
 - tests: refactor mechanics of testing in a sub test-lib
 - tests: paint skipped tests in bold blue
 - tests: test number comes first in 'not ok $count - $message'
 - tests: paint known breakages in bold yellow

 Various minor tweaks to the test framework to paint its output
 lines in colors that match what they mean better.

 Has the "is this really blue?" issue Peff raised resolved???


* jc/maint-name-rev (2012-09-17) 7 commits
 - describe --contains: use "name-rev --algorithm=weight"
 - name-rev --algorithm=weight: tests and documentation
 - name-rev --algorithm=weight: cache the computed weight in notes
 - name-rev --algorithm=weight: trivial optimization
 - name-rev: --algorithm option
 - name_rev: clarify the logic to assign a new tip-name to a commit
 - name-rev: lose unnecessary typedef

 "git name-rev" names the given revision based on a ref that can be
 reached in the smallest number of steps from the rev, but that is
 not useful when the caller wants to know which tag is the oldest one
 that contains the rev.  This teaches a new mode to the command that
 uses the oldest ref among those which contain the rev.

 I am not sure if this is worth it; for one thing, even with the help
 from notes-cache, it seems to make the "describe --contains" even
 slower. Also the command will be unusably slow for a user who does
 not have a write access (hence unable to create or update the
 notes-cache).

 Stalled mostly due to lack of responses.


* jc/xprm-generation (2012-09-14) 1 commit
 - test-generation: compute generation numbers and clock skews

 A toy to analyze how bad the clock skews are in histories of real
 world projects.

 Stalled mostly due to lack of responses.


* jc/blame-no-follow (2012-09-21) 2 commits
 - blame: pay attention to --no-follow
 - diff: accept --no-follow option

 Teaches "--no-follow" option to "git blame" to disable its
 whole-file rename detection.

 Stalled mostly due to lack of responses.


* jc/doc-default-format (2012-10-07) 2 commits
 - [SQAUSH] allow "cd Doc* && make DEFAULT_DOC_TARGET=..."
 - Allow generating a non-default set of documentation

 Need to address the installation half if this is to be any useful.


* mk/maint-graph-infinity-loop (2012-09-25) 1 commit
 - graph.c: infinite loop in git whatchanged --graph -m

 The --graph code fell into infinite loop when asked to do what the
 code did not expect ;-)

 Anybody who worked on "--graph" wants to comment?
 Stalled mostly due to lack of responses.


* jc/add-delete-default (2012-08-13) 1 commit
 - git add: notice removal of tracked paths by default

 "git add dir/" updated modified files and added new files, but does
 not notice removed files, which may be "Huh?" to some users.  They
 can of course use "git add -A dir/", but why should they?

 Resurrected from graveyard, as I thought it was a worthwhile thing
 to do in the longer term.

 Waiting for comments.


* mb/remote-default-nn-origin (2012-07-11) 6 commits
 - Teach get_default_remote to respect remote.default.
 - Test that plain "git fetch" uses remote.default when on a detached HEAD.
 - Teach clone to set remote.default.
 - Teach "git remote" about remote.default.
 - Teach remote.c about the remote.default configuration setting.
 - Rename remote.c's default_remote_name static variables.

 When the user does not specify what remote to interact with, we
 often attempt to use 'origin'.  This can now be customized via a
 configuration variable.

 Expecting a reroll.

 "The first remote becomes the default" bit is better done as a
 separate step.

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* mh/ceiling (2012-10-29) 8 commits
 - string_list_longest_prefix(): remove function
 - setup_git_directory_gently_1(): resolve symlinks in ceiling paths
 - longest_ancestor_length(): require prefix list entries to be normalized
 - longest_ancestor_length(): take a string_list argument for prefixes
 - longest_ancestor_length(): use string_list_split()
 - Introduce new function real_path_if_valid()
 - real_path_internal(): add comment explaining use of cwd
 - Introduce new static function real_path_internal()

 Elements of GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES list may not match the real
 pathname we obtain from getcwd(), leading the GIT_DIR discovery
 logic to escape the ceilings the user thought to have specified.

 Need to look at v4 which made it to the list.

* ta/doc-cleanup (2012-10-25) 6 commits
 - Documentation: build html for all files in technical and howto
 - Documentation/howto: convert plain text files to asciidoc
 - Documentation/technical: convert plain text files to asciidoc
 - Change headline of technical/send-pack-pipeline.txt to not confuse its content with content from git-send-pack.txt
 - Shorten two over-long lines in git-bisect-lk2009.txt by abbreviating some sha1
 - Split over-long synopsis in git-fetch-pack.txt into several lines

 Misapplication of a patch fixed; the ones near the tip needs to
 update the links to point at the html files, though.

 Needs follow-up on Junio's comment above.


* lt/diff-stat-show-0-lines (2012-10-17) 1 commit
 - Fix "git diff --stat" for interesting - but empty - file changes

 We failed to mention a file without any content change but whose
 permission bit was modified, or (worse yet) a new file without any
 content in the "git diff --stat" output.

 Needs some test updates.


* jc/prettier-pretty-note (2012-10-26) 11 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-11-04 at 40e3e48)
 + Doc User-Manual: Patch cover letter, three dashes, and --notes

 + format-patch: append --signature after notes
 + pretty_print_commit(): do not append notes message
 + pretty: prepare notes message at a centralized place

 Now that Philip has submitted some documentation updates, this is
 looking more ready.

* sz/maint-curl-multi-timeout (2012-10-19) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-11-04 at f696dd8)
 + Fix potential hang in https handshake

 Sometimes curl_multi_timeout() function suggested a wrong timeout
 value when there is no file descriptors to wait on and the http
 transport ended up sleeping for minutes in select(2) system call.
 Detect this and reduce the wait timeout in such a case.

 Will merge to master in the fourth batch.


* jc/same-encoding (2012-11-04) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-11-04 at 54991f2)
 + reencode_string(): introduce and use same_encoding()

 Various codepaths checked if two encoding names are the same using
 ad-hoc code and some of them ended up asking iconv() to convert
 between "utf8" and "UTF-8".  The former is not a valid way to spell
 the encoding name, but often people use it by mistake, and we
 equated them in some but not all codepaths. Introduce a new helper
 function to make these codepaths consistent.

 will merge to master in the fourth batch.


* nd/tree-walk-enum-cleanup (2012-10-19) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-11-04 at 8ccdf98)

* cr/cvsimport-local-zone (2012-11-04) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-11-04 at 292f0b4)

 Will merge to master in the fourth batch.


* fc/zsh-completion (2012-10-29) 3 commits
 - completion: add new zsh completion
 - completion: add new __gitcompadd helper
 - completion: get rid of empty COMPREPLY assignments

 Needs comments from completion folks.


* jc/apply-trailing-blank-removal (2012-10-12) 1 commit
 - apply.c:update_pre_post_images(): the preimage can be truncated

 Fix to update_pre_post_images() that did not take into account the
 possibility that whitespace fix could shrink the preimage and
 change the number of lines in it.

 Extra set of eyeballs appreciated.


* jn/warn-on-inaccessible-loosen (2012-10-14) 4 commits
 - config: exit on error accessing any config file
 - doc: advertise GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM
 - config: treat user and xdg config permission problems as errors
 - config, gitignore: failure to access with ENOTDIR is ok

 An RFC to deal with a situation where .config/git is a file and we
 notice .config/git/config is not readable due to ENOTDIR, not
 ENOENT; I think a bit more refactored approach to consistently
 address permission errors across config, exclude and attrs is
 desirable.  Don't we also need a check for an opposite situation
 where we open .config/git/config or .gitattributes for reading but
 they turn out to be directories?


* rs/lock-correct-ref-during-delete (2012-10-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-10-25 at 9341eea)
 + refs: lock symref that is to be deleted, not its target

 When "update-ref -d --no-deref SYM" tried to delete a symbolic ref
 SYM, it incorrectly locked the underlying reference pointed by SYM,
 not the symbolic ref itself.

 Will merge to 'master' in the fourth batch.


* as/check-ignore (2012-10-29) 13 commits
 - Documentation/check-ignore: we show the deciding match, not the first
 - Add git-check-ignore sub-command
 - dir.c: provide free_directory() for reclaiming dir_struct memory
 - pathspec.c: move reusable code from builtin/add.c
 - dir.c: refactor treat_gitlinks()
 - dir.c: keep track of where patterns came from
 - dir.c: refactor is_path_excluded()
 - dir.c: refactor is_excluded()
 - dir.c: refactor is_excluded_from_list()
 - dir.c: rename excluded() to is_excluded()
 - dir.c: rename excluded_from_list() to is_excluded_from_list()
 - dir.c: rename path_excluded() to is_path_excluded()
 - dir.c: rename cryptic 'which' variable to more consistent name
 (this branch uses nd/attr-match-optim-more; is tangled with nd/wildmatch.)

 Duy helped to reroll this.

 Expecting another re-roll.


* js/format-2047 (2012-10-18) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-10-25 at 76d91fe)

 + format-patch: fix rfc2047 address encoding with respect to rfc822 specials
 + format-patch: make rfc2047 encoding more strict
 + format-patch: introduce helper function last_line_length()
 + format-patch: do not wrap rfc2047 encoded headers too late
 + format-patch: do not wrap non-rfc2047 headers too early
 + utf8: fix off-by-one wrapping of text

 Fixes many rfc2047 quoting issues in the output from format-patch.

 Will merge to 'master' in the fourth batch.


* km/send-email-compose-encoding (2012-10-25) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-10-29 at d7d2bb4)
 + git-send-email: add rfc2047 quoting for "=?"
 + git-send-email: introduce quote_subject()
 + git-send-email: skip RFC2047 quoting for ASCII subjects
 + git-send-email: use compose-encoding for Subject
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-10-25 at 5447367)
 + git-send-email: introduce compose-encoding

 "git send-email --compose" can let the user create a non-ascii
 cover letter message, but there was not a way to mark it with
 appropriate content type before sending it out.

 Further updates fix subject quoting.

 Will merge to 'master' in the fourth batch.


* so/prompt-command (2012-10-17) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-10-25 at 79565a1)
 + coloured git-prompt: paint detached HEAD marker in red
 + Fix up colored git-prompt
 + show color hints based on state of the git tree
 + Allow __git_ps1 to be used in PROMPT_COMMAND

 Updates __git_ps1 so that it can be used as $PROMPT_COMMAND,
 instead of being used for command substitution in $PS1, to embed
 color escape sequences in its output.

 Will 'cook' in next.


* aw/rebase-am-failure-detection (2012-10-11) 1 commit
 - rebase: Handle cases where format-patch fails

 I am unhappy a bit about the possible performance implications of
 having to store the output in a temporary file only for a rare case
 of format-patch aborting.


* nd/wildmatch (2012-10-15) 13 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-10-25 at 510e8df)
 + Support "**" wildcard in .gitignore and .gitattributes
 + wildmatch: make /**/ match zero or more directories
 + wildmatch: adjust "**" behavior
 + wildmatch: fix case-insensitive matching
 + wildmatch: remove static variable force_lower_case
 + wildmatch: make wildmatch's return value compatible with fnmatch
 + t3070: disable unreliable fnmatch tests
 + Integrate wildmatch to git
 + wildmatch: follow Git's coding convention
 + wildmatch: remove unnecessary functions
 + Import wildmatch from rsync
 + ctype: support iscntrl, ispunct, isxdigit and isprint
 + ctype: make sane_ctype[] const array
 (this branch uses nd/attr-match-optim-more; is tangled with as/check-ignore.)

 Allows pathname patterns in .gitignore and .gitattributes files
 with double-asterisks "foo/**/bar" to match any number of directory
 hierarchies.

 I suspect that this needs to be plugged to pathspec matching code;
 otherwise "git log -- 'Docum*/**/*.txt'" would not show the log for
 commits that touch Documentation/git.txt, which would be confusing
 to the users.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* jk/lua-hackery (2012-10-07) 6 commits
 - pretty: fix up one-off format_commit_message calls
 - Minimum compilation fixup
 - Makefile: make "lua" a bit more configurable
 - add a "lua" pretty format
 - add basic lua infrastructure
 - pretty: make some commit-parsing helpers more public

 Interesting exercise. When we do this for real, we probably would want
 to wrap a commit to make it more like an "object" with methods like
 "parents", etc.


* nd/attr-match-optim-more (2012-10-15) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-10-25 at 09f70ce)
 + attr: more matching optimizations from .gitignore
 + gitignore: make pattern parsing code a separate function
 + exclude: split pathname matching code into a separate function
 + exclude: fix a bug in prefix compare optimization
 + exclude: split basename matching code into a separate function
 + exclude: stricten a length check in EXC_FLAG_ENDSWITH case
 + Merge commit 'f9f6e2c' into nd/attr-match-optim-more
 (this branch is used by as/check-ignore and nd/wildmatch.)

 Start laying the foundation to build the "wildmatch" after we can
 agree on its desired semantics.

 Will merge to 'master' in the fourth batch.


* nd/pretty-placeholder-with-color-option (2012-09-30) 9 commits
 . pretty: support %>> that steal trailing spaces
 . pretty: support truncating in %>, %< and %><
 . pretty: support padding placeholders, %< %> and %><
 . pretty: two phase conversion for non utf-8 commits
 . utf8.c: add utf8_strnwidth() with the ability to skip ansi sequences
 . utf8.c: move display_mode_esc_sequence_len() for use by other functions
 . pretty: support %C(auto[,N]) to turn on coloring on next placeholder(s)
 . pretty: split parsing %C into a separate function
 . pretty: share code between format_decoration and show_decorations

 This causes warnings with -Wuninitialized, so I've ejected it from pu
 for the time being.


* jc/maint-fetch-tighten-refname-check (2012-10-19) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-11-04 at eda85ef)
 + get_fetch_map(): tighten checks on dest refs

 This was split out from discarded jc/maint-push-refs-all topic.

 Will merge to master in the fifth batch.


* jh/symbolic-ref-d (2012-10-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-11-04 at b0762f5)
 + git symbolic-ref --delete $symref

 Add "symbolic-ref -d SYM" to delete a symbolic ref SYM.

 It is already possible to remove a symbolic ref with "update-ref -d
