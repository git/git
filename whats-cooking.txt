What's cooking in git.git (May 2016, #05; Fri, 13)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

The 'master' branch now has the eleventh batch of topics of this
cycle.  On the 'maint' front, 2.8.2 is out and fixes that have been
in 'master' accumulates on it for 2.8.3.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

* jc/commit-tree-ignore-commit-gpgsign (2016-05-03) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-05-06 at 08eccb2)
 + commit-tree: do not pay attention to commit.gpgsign

 "git commit-tree" plumbing command required the user to always sign
 its result when the user sets the commit.gpgsign configuration
 variable, which was an ancient mistake.  Rework "git rebase" that
 relied on this mistake so that it reads commit.gpgsign and pass (or
 not pass) the -S option to "git commit-tree" to keep the end-user
 expectation the same, while teaching "git commit-tree" to ignore
 the configuration variable.  This will stop requiring the users to
 sign commit objects used internally as an implementation detail of
 "git stash".

 The "git apply" standalone program is being libified; this is the
 first step to move many state variables into a structure that can
 be explicitly (re)initialized to make the machinery callable more
 than once.

 The next step that moves some remaining state variables into the
 structure and turns die()s into an error return that propagates up
 to the caller is not queued yet but in flight.  It would be good to
 review the above first and give the remainder of the series a solid
 base to build on.

 verified.  Also the phrasing used for signature and key validity is
 adjusted to align with that used by OpenPGP.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 The existing "git fetch --depth=<n>" option was hard to use
 correctly when making the history of an existing shallow clone
 deeper.  A new option, "--deepen=<n>", has been added to make this
 easier to use.  "git clone" also learned "--shallow-since=<date>"
 and "--shallow-exclude=<tag>" options to make it easier to specify
 "I am interested only in the recent N months worth of history" and
 "Give me only the history since that version".

* az/p4-bare-no-rebase (2016-02-19) 1 commit
 - git-p4.py: Don't try to rebase on submit from bare repository

 "git p4 submit" attempts to do a rebase, which would fail if done
 in a bare repository.  Not doing this rebase would paper over the
 failure, which is what this patch does, but it is unclear what the
 side effect of not rebasing is.

* js/am-3-merge-recursive-direct (2015-10-12) 2 commits
 - am: make a direct call to merge_recursive
 - merge_recursive_options: introduce the "gently" flag

 The merge_recursive_generic() function has been made a bit safer to
 call from inside a process.  "git am -3" was taught to make a direct
 call to the function when falling back to three-way merge.

 Being able to make a direct call would be good in general, but as a
 performance thing, the change needs to be backed up by numbers.

 I haven't gone through the "gently" change with fine toothed comb;
 I can see that the change avoids calling die(), but I haven't made
 sure that the program states (e.g. what's in the in-core index) are
 adjusted sensibly when it returns to the caller instead of dying,
 or the codepaths that used to die() are free of resource leaks.
 The original code certainly did not care the program states at the
 point of dying exactly because it knew it is going to exit, but now
 they have to care, and they need to be audited.

 Will be rerolled.

 . WIPWIP
 . WIP: diff-b-m
 - diffcore-rename: allow easier debugging
 - diffcore-rename.c: add locate_rename_src()
 - diffcore-break: allow debugging

 "git diff -B -M" produced incorrect patch when the postimage of a
 completely rewritten file is similar to the preimage of a removed
 file; such a resulting file must not be expressed as a rename from
 other place.

 The fix in this patch is broken, unfortunately.

* jc/merge-impossible-no-commit (2016-04-26) 2 commits
 - merge: warn --no-commit merge when no new commit is created
 - merge: do not contaminate option_commit with --squash

 "git merge --no-commit" silently succeeded when there is no need to
 create any commit, either when you are more recent than the commit
 you tried to merge, or you can fast-forward to the commit you tried
 to merge.  The command gives a warning message in such cases.

 Just tying loose ends in a discussion.  Unless somebody else
 champions this topic, I'll drop it.

 Will discard.

* ar/diff-args-osx-precompose (2016-05-13) 1 commit
 - diff: run arguments through precompose_argv

 Many commands normalize command line arguments from NFD to NFC

 not, causing "git diff $path" to complain that no such path is

 + test-lib: set BASH_XTRACEFD automatically

 Running tests with '-x' option to trace the individual command
 executions is a useful way to debug test scripts, but some tests
 that capture the standard error stream and check what the command
 said can be broken with the trace output mixed in.  When running
 our tests under "bash", however, we can redirect the trace output
 to another file descriptor to keep the standard error of programs
 being tested intact.

  (merged to 'next' on 2016-05-10 at 7cf5cca)
 + submodule: ensure that -c http.extraheader is heeded
 + Merge branch 'jk/submodule-c-credential' into js/http-custom-headers
 + t5551: make the test for extra HTTP headers more robust
 + tests: adjust the configuration for Apache 2.2
 (this branch uses jk/submodule-c-credential.)

 Update tests for "http.extraHeaders=<header>" to be portable back
 to Apache 2.2 (the original depended on <RequireAll/> which is a
 more recent feature).

* sb/submodule-deinit-all (2016-05-05) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-05-09 at 0fd4518)
 + submodule deinit: require '--all' instead of '.' for all submodules

 Correct faulty recommendation to use "git submodule deinit ." when
 de-initialising all submodules, which would result in a strange
 error message in a pathological corner case.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* bn/config-doc-tt-varnames (2016-05-05) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-05-10 at aa7b834)

* jc/test-parse-options-expect (2016-05-10) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-05-10 at 3ca5783)

 + t0040: remove unused test helpers
 + test-parse-options: --expect=<string> option to simplify tests
 + test-parse-options: fix output when callback option fails
 (this branch uses pb/commit-verbose-config.)

 t0040 had too many unnecessary repetitions in its test data.  Teach
 test-parse-options program so that a caller can tell what it
 expects in its output, so that these repetitions can be cleaned up.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/doc-lint (2016-05-10) 1 commit
 - ci: validate "linkgit:" in documentation

 Find common mistakes when writing gitlink: in our documentation and
 drive the check from "make check-docs".

 I am not entirely happy with the way the script chooses what input
 file to validate, but it is not worse than not having anything, so
 let's move it forward and have the logic improved later when people
 care about it deeply.

  (merged to 'next' on 2016-05-06 at e91626c)
 + Windows: add pthread_sigmask() that does nothing

 Some Windows SDK lacks pthread_sigmask() implementation and fails
 to compile the recently updated "git push" codepath that uses it.

 + githooks.txt: improve the intro section

 A new configuration variable core.hooksPath allows customizing
 where the hook directory is.

* bn/http-cookiefile-config (2016-05-04) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-05-09 at d519b13)
 + http: expand http.cookieFile as a path
 + Documentation: config: improve word ordering for http.cookieFile

 "http.cookieFile" configuration variable clearly wants a pathname,
 but we forgot to treat it as such by e.g. applying tilde expansion.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/config-pathname-type (2016-05-04) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-05-09 at 0876e55)

* jk/submodule-c-credential (2016-05-06) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-05-10 at 4abe871)
 + submodule: stop sanitizing config options
 + submodule: use prepare_submodule_repo_env consistently
 + submodule--helper: move config-sanitizing to submodule.c
 + submodule: export sanitized GIT_CONFIG_PARAMETERS
 + t5550: break submodule config test into multiple sub-tests
 + t5550: fix typo in $HTTPD_URL
 (this branch is used by js/http-custom-headers.)

 An earlier addition of "sanitize_submodule_env" with 14111fc4 (git:
 submodule honor -c credential.* from command line, 2016-02-29)
 turned out to be a convoluted no-op; implement what it wanted to do
 correctly, and stop filtering settings given via "git -c var=val".

 Will merge to 'master'.


* mh/connect-leak (2016-04-28) 1 commit

* ew/fast-import-unpack-limit (2016-05-11) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-05-11 at ffd4efb)
 + fast-import: implement unpack limit

 "git fast-import" learned the same performance trick to avoid
 creating too small a packfile as "git fetch" and "git push" have,
 using *.unpackLimit configuration.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* nd/worktree-various-heads (2016-04-22) 13 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-05-10 at 61d3415)

 + dir.c: rename str(n)cmp_icase to fspath(n)cmp
 (this branch is used by nd/worktree-cleanup-post-head-protection.)

 The experimental "multiple worktree" feature gains more safety to
 forbid operations on a branch that is checked out or being actively
 worked on elsewhere, by noticing that e.g. it is being rebased.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* pb/commit-verbose-config (2016-05-10) 7 commits

 configuration variable and act as if "--verbose" option was
 given from the command line.

 + fsck: detect and warn a commit with embedded NUL
 + fsck_commit_buffer(): do not special case the last validation

 "git fsck" learned to catch NUL byte in a commit object as
 potential error and warn.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/ll-merge-internal (2016-05-09) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-05-10 at a6bf1d0)
 + t6036: remove pointless test that expects failure
 + ll-merge: use a longer conflict marker for internal merge
 + ll-merge: fix typo in comment

 "git rerere" can get confused by conflict markers deliberately left
 by the inner merge step, because they are indistinguishable from
 the real conflict markers left by the outermost merge which are
 what the end user and "rerere" need to look at.  This was fixed by
 making the conflict markers left by the inner merges a bit longer.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* sb/submodule-init (2016-05-03) 7 commits

 + Merge branch 'sb/submodule-path-misc-bugs' into sb/submodule-init
 + Merge branch 'sb/submodule-helper-clone-regression-fix' into sb/submodule-init

 Update of "git submodule" to move pieces of logic to C continues.

 Will cook for a bit more in 'next'.


* jc/send-email-skip-backup (2016-04-12) 1 commit
 - send-email: detect and offer to skip backup files

 A careless invocation of "git send-email directory/" after editing
 0001-change.patch with an editor often ends up sending both
 0001-change.patch and its backup file, 0001-change.patch~, causing
 embarrassment and a minor confusion.  Detect such an input and
 offer to skip the backup files when sending the patches out.

 Needs review.

 its output.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 A new "index-helper" daemon has been introduced to give newly
 spawned Git process a quicker access to the data in the index, and
 optionally interface with the watchman daemon to further reduce the
 refresh cost.

 Under review.

 - bundle v3: the beginning
 - bundle: keep a copy of bundle file name in the in-core bundle header

 The beginning of "split bundle", which could be one of the
 ingredients to allow "git clone" traffic off of the core server
 network to CDN.


* jc/merge-drop-old-syntax (2015-04-29) 1 commit
 - merge: drop 'git merge <message> HEAD <commit>' syntax

 Stop supporting "git merge <message> HEAD <commit>" syntax that has
 been deprecated since October 2007, and issues a deprecation
 warning message since v2.5.0.

 It has been reported that git-gui still uses the deprecated syntax,
 which needs to be fixed before this final step can proceed.
