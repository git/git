What's cooking in git.git (Nov 2013, #01; Fri, 1)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.

An early preview 1.8.5-rc0 has been tagged. There still are handful
of fixes and enhancements left in 'next' that I'd like to see in the
final, which will hopefully be in when the first release candidate
is tagged.

As promised/requested, the final steps for 2.0 are in 'next'; they,
together with a handful topics that have been merged to 'next'
fairly recently, will _not_ be part of the upcoming 1.8.5 release,
but will be carried over in 'next' to the next cycle.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

* ap/remote-hg-unquote-cquote (2013-10-23) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-10-28 at 6b99fd5)
 + remote-hg: unquote C-style paths when exporting

 A fast-import stream expresses a pathname with funny characters by
 quoting them in C style; remote-hg remote helper forgot to unquote
 such a path.


* jk/for-each-ref-skip-parsing (2013-10-30) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-10-30 at 56ea310)
 + for-each-ref: avoid loading objects to print %(objectname)


* jk/pack-corruption-post-mortem (2013-10-25) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-10-30 at 2248df6)
 + howto: add article on recovering a corrupted object


* jk/reset-p-current-head-fix (2013-10-25) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-10-30 at 37ae6e0)
 + reset: pass real rev name to add--interactive
 + add-interactive: handle unborn branch in patch mode

 "git reset -p HEAD" has codepath to special case it from resetting
 to contents of other commits, but recent change broke it.


* jl/submodule-mv (2013-10-13) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-10-28 at 8dc9b31)
 + mv: Fix spurious warning when moving a file in presence of submodules

 Moving a regular file in a repository with a .gitmodules file was
 producing a warning 'Could not find section in .gitmodules where
 path=<filename>'.


* js/test-help-format-windows-port-fix (2013-10-30) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-10-30 at b98e991)

 + Documentation: restore a space in unpack-objects usage

 - t1005: add test for "read-tree --reset -u A B"
 - t1005: reindent

* np/pack-v4 (2013-09-18) 90 commits
 . packv4-parse.c: add tree offset caching
 . t1050: replace one instance of show-index with verify-pack
 . index-pack, pack-objects: allow creating .idx v2 with .pack v4
 . unpack-objects: decode v4 trees
 . unpack-objects: allow to save processed bytes to a buffer
 - ...

 Nico and Duy advancing the eternal vaporware pack-v4.  This is here
 primarily for wider distribution of the preview edition.

 Temporarily ejected from 'pu', to try out jk/pack-bitmap, which
 this topic conflicts with.


* mf/graph-show-root (2013-10-25) 1 commit
 . graph.c: mark root commit differently

 In a repository with multiple-roots, "log --graph", especially with
 "--oneline", does not give the reader enough visual cue to see
 where one line of history ended and a separate history began.

 This is the version that marks the roots 'x' when they would have
 been marked as '*'; Keshav Kini suggested an alternative of giving
 an extra blank line after every root, which I tend to think is a
 better approach to the problem.


* tg/perf-lib-test-perf-cleanup (2013-09-19) 2 commits
 - perf-lib: add test_perf_cleanup target
 - perf-lib: split starting the test from the execution

 Add test_perf_cleanup shell function to the perf suite, that allows
 the script writers to define a test with a clean-up action.

 Holding until needed.


* yt/shortened-rename (2013-10-18) 2 commits
 - SQUASH??? style fixes and s/omit/shorten/ where appropriate
 - diff.c: keep arrow(=>) on show_stats()'s shortened filename part to make rename visible

 Attempts to give more weight on the fact that a filepair represents
 a rename than showing substring of the actual path when diffstat
 lines are not wide enough.

 I am not sure if that is solving a right problem, though.


* rv/send-email-cache-generated-mid (2013-08-21) 2 commits
 - git-send-email: Cache generated message-ids, use them when prompting
 - git-send-email: add optional 'choices' parameter to the ask sub


* rj/read-default-config-in-show-ref-pack-refs (2013-06-17) 3 commits
 - ### DONTMERGE: needs better explanation on what config they need
 - pack-refs.c: Add missing call to git_config()
 - show-ref.c: Add missing call to git_config()

 The changes themselves are probably good, but it is unclear what
 basic setting needs to be read for which exact operation.

 Waiting for clarification.
 $gmane/228294


* jc/format-patch (2013-04-22) 2 commits
 - format-patch: --inline-single
 - format-patch: rename "no_inline" field

 A new option to send a single patch to the standard output to be
 appended at the bottom of a message.  I personally have no need for
 this, but it was easy enough to cobble together.  Tests, docs and
 stripping out more MIMEy stuff are left as exercises to interested
 parties.


* jk/gitweb-utf8 (2013-04-08) 4 commits
 - gitweb: Fix broken blob action parameters on blob/commitdiff pages
 - gitweb: Don't append ';js=(0|1)' to external links

 - gitweb: Fix utf8 encoding for blob_plain, blobdiff_plain, commitdiff_plain, and patch

 Various fixes to gitweb.

 Drew Northup volunteered to take a look into this.

* jc/ref-excludes (2013-11-01) 5 commits
 - rev-parse: introduce --exclude=<glob> to tame wildcards
 - rev-list --exclude: export add/clear-ref-exclusion and ref-excluded API
 - rev-list --exclude: tests
 - document --exclude option
 - revision: introduce --exclude=<glob> to tame wildcards

 People often wished a way to tell "git log --branches" (and "git
 log --remotes --not --branches") to exclude some local branches
 from the expansion of "--branches" (similarly for "--tags", "--all"
 and "--glob=<pattern>").  Now they have one.

* jt/commit-fixes-footer (2013-10-30) 1 commit
 - commit: Add -f, --fixes <commit> option to add Fixes: line

 There is an ongoing discussion around this topic; in general I am
 fairly negative on a new feature that is too narrow and prefer a
 more generic solution that can be tailored for specific needs, as
 many people stated in the thread.

* th/reflog-annotated-tag (2013-10-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-11-01 at 8b154cc)
 + reflog: handle lightweight and annotated tags equally

 "git log -g $annotated_tag", when there is no reflog history, should
 have produced a single output entry (i.e. the ref creation event),
 but instead showed the history leading to the tag.

 Will merge to 'master'.

* jc/merge-base-reflog (2013-10-29) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-11-01 at 6114764)

 Enhance "rev-parse --parseopt" mode to help parsing options with
 an optional parameter.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* ak/submodule-foreach-quoting (2013-09-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-10-14 at d77c5f1)
 + submodule foreach: skip eval for more than one argument

 A behavior change, but a worthwhile one: "git submodule foreach"
 was treating its arguments as part of a single command to be
 concatenated and passed to a shell, making writing buggy
 scripts too easy.

 This patch preserves the old "just pass it to the shell" behavior
 when a single argument is passed to 'git submodule foreach' and
 moves to a new "skip the shell and use the arguments passed
 unmolested" behavior when more than one argument is passed.

 The old behavior (always concatenating and passing to the shell)
 was similar to the 'ssh' command, while the new behavior (switching
 on the number of arguments) is what 'xterm -e' does.

 May need more thought to make sure this change is advertised well
 so that scripts that used multiple arguments but added their own
 extra layer of quoting are not broken.

 Will cook in 'next' for the rest of this cycle.


* kb/fast-hashmap (2013-10-22) 12 commits
 - remove old hash.[ch] implementation
 - read-cache.c: fix memory leaks caused by removed cache entries
 - name-hash.c: remove cache entries instead of marking them CE_UNHASHED
 - name-hash.c: use new hash map implementation for cache entries
 - name-hash.c: remove unreferenced directory entries
 - name-hash.c: use new hash map implementation for directories
 - diffcore-rename.c: use new hash map implementation
 - diffcore-rename.c: simplify finding exact renames
 - diffcore-rename.c: move code around to prepare for the next patch
 - buitin/describe.c: use new hash map implementation
 - add a hashtable implementation that supports O(1) removal
 - submodule: don't access the .gitmodules cache entry after removing it

 Improvements to our hash table to get it to meet the needs of the
 msysgit fscache project, with some nice performance improvements.

 The preparatory clean-up to submodule from Jens is at the bottom. I
 also squashed in a fix-up by Karsten found at $gmane/236468 (please
 double-check the result).

 More valgrind breakage reported ($gmane/236869).
