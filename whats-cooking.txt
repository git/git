What's cooking in git.git (Oct 2022, #09; Mon, 31)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a future
release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and aren't
considered "accepted" at all.  A topic without enough support may be
discarded after a long period of no activity.

This is the first pushout from the interim maintainer. Topics which
were marked as ready for 'master' have been merged, and 'next' is now
empty. A number of topics have been marked for 'next' which will start
graduating in the next round.

Please point out any glitches you see along the way. If a topic you
sent doesn't appear here, please nudge me or resend it.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	https://github.com/git/git/

The following mirrors are currently out-of-date while the usual
maintainer is offline.

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/ttaylorr/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are typically published in these repositories
for convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
  pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

...but these and the release tarballs below are similarly out-of-date:

 (this branch is used by pw/rebase-reflog-fixes.)

 "git rebase --keep-base" used to discard the commits that are
 already cherry-picked to the upstream, even when "keep-base" meant
 that the base, on top of which the history is being rebuilt, does
 not yet include these cherry-picked commits.  The --keep-base
 option now implies --reapply-cherry-picks and --no-fork-point
 options.

 (this branch uses pw/rebase-keep-base-fixes.)

 Fix some bugs in the reflog messages when rebasing and changes the
 reflog messages of "rebase --apply" to match "rebase --merge" with
 the aim of making the reflog easier to parse.

 "git branch --edit-description" can exit with status -1 which is

* ps/receive-use-only-advertised (2022-10-28) 3 commits
 - SQUASH - leakfix
 - receive-pack: use advertised reference tips to inform connectivity check
 - connected: allow supplying different view of reachable objects

 "git receive-pack" used to use all the local refs as the boundary
 for checking connectivity of the data "git push" sent, but now it
 uses only the refs that it advertised to the pusher.  In a
 repository with the .hideRefs configuration, this reduces the
 resource needed to perform the check, and also forces the pusher to
 prove they have all objects that are necessary to complete the
 history on top of only the history available to them.

 Expecting a reroll.
