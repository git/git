What's cooking in git.git (Jul 2014, #01; Tue, 8)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

[Graduated to "master"]

* bc/fix-rebase-merge-skip (2014-06-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-06-20 at 01f81f5)
 + rebase--merge: fix --skip with two conflicts in a row

 "git rebase --skip" did not work well when it stopped due to a
 conflict twice in a row.


* dt/refs-check-refname-component-sse (2014-06-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-06-20 at d286027)
 + refs.c: SSE2 optimizations for check_refname_component

 Further micro-optimization of a leaf-function.


* jk/commit-buffer-length (2014-06-13) 18 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-06-16 at b2d2d7b)
 + reuse cached commit buffer when parsing signatures
 + commit: record buffer length in cache
 + commit: convert commit->buffer to a slab
 + commit-slab: provide a static initializer
 + use get_commit_buffer everywhere
 + convert logmsg_reencode to get_commit_buffer
 + use get_commit_buffer to avoid duplicate code
 + use get_cached_commit_buffer where appropriate
 + provide helpers to access the commit buffer
 + provide a helper to set the commit buffer
 + provide a helper to free commit buffer
 + sequencer: use logmsg_reencode in get_message
 + logmsg_reencode: return const buffer
 + do not create "struct commit" with xcalloc
 + commit: push commit_index update into alloc_commit_node
 + alloc: include any-object allocations in alloc_report
 + replace dangerous uses of strbuf_attach
 + commit_tree: take a pointer/len pair rather than a const strbuf

 Move "commit->buffer" out of the in-core commit object and keep
 track of their lengths.  Use this to optimize the code paths to
 validate GPG signatures in commit objects.

  (merged to 'next' on 2014-06-20 at 9492bae)

 - git-rebase: print name of rev when using shorthand

 Teach "git rebase -" to report the concrete name of the branch
 (i.e. the previous one).

 But it stops short and does not do the same for "git rebase @{-1}".
 Expecting a reroll.


* tr/merge-recursive-index-only (2014-02-05) 3 commits
 - merge-recursive: -Xindex-only to leave worktree unchanged
 - merge-recursive: internal flag to avoid touching the worktree

 . name-hash: allow dir hashing even when !ignore_case
 . merge-recursive: allow storing conflict hunks in index
 . revision: fold all merge diff variants into an enum merge_diff_mode
 . combine-diff: do not pass revs->dense_combined_merges redundantly
 (this branch uses tr/merge-recursive-index-only.)

 "log -p" output learns a new way to let users inspect a merge
 commit by showing the differences between the automerged result
 with conflicts the person who recorded the merge would have seen
 and the final conflict resolution that was recorded in the merge.

 Needs to be rebased, now kb/fast-hashmap topic is in.


* jk/makefile (2014-02-05) 16 commits
 . FIXUP
 . move LESS/LV pager environment to Makefile
 . Makefile: teach scripts to include make variables
 . FIXUP
 . Makefile: auto-build C strings from make variables

 . Makefile: use tempfile/mv strategy for GIT-*
 . Makefile: introduce make-var helper function
 . Makefile: fix git-instaweb dependency on gitweb
 . Makefile: drop USE_GETTEXT_SCHEME from GIT-CFLAGS

 Simplify the Makefile rules and macros that exist primarily for
 quoting purposes, and make it easier to robustly express the
 dependency rules.

 Expecting a reroll.


* po/everyday-doc (2014-01-27) 1 commit
 - Make 'git help everyday' work

 This may make the said command to emit something, but the source is
 not meant to be formatted into a manual pages to begin with, and
 also its contents are a bit stale.  It may be a good first step in
 the right direction, but needs more work to at least get the
 mark-up right before public consumption.

 Will hold.


* jk/branch-at-publish-rebased (2014-01-17) 5 commits
 . t1507 (rev-parse-upstream): fix typo in test title
 . implement @{publish} shorthand
 . branch_get: provide per-branch pushremote pointers
 . branch_get: return early on error
 . sha1_name: refactor upstream_mark

 Give an easier access to the tracking branches from "other" side in
 a triangular workflow by introducing B@{publish} that works in a
 similar way to how B@{upstream} does.

 Meant to be used as a basis for whatever Ram wants to build on.

 Ejected from 'pu' to unclutter.


* fc/publish-vs-upstream (2014-04-21) 8 commits
 . sha1_name: add support for @{publish} marks
 . sha1_name: simplify track finding
 . sha1_name: cleanup interpret_branch_name()
 . branch: display publish branch
 . push: add --set-publish option
 . branch: add --set-publish-to option
 . Add concept of 'publish' branch
 . t5516 (fetch-push): fix test restoration

 Add branch@{publish}; it seems that this is somewhat different from
 Ram and Peff started working on.  At least the tip needs to be
 rerolled not to squat on @{p} which @{push} and possibly @{pull}
 may want to share.


* rb/merge-prepare-commit-msg-hook (2014-01-10) 4 commits
 - merge: drop unused arg from abort_commit method signature
 - merge: make prepare_to_commit responsible for write_merge_state
 - t7505: ensure cleanup after hook blocks merge
 - t7505: add missing &&

 Expose more merge states (e.g. $GIT_DIR/MERGE_MODE) to hooks that
 run during "git merge".  The log message stresses too much on one
 hook, prepare-commit-msg, but it would equally apply to other hooks
 like post-merge, I think.

 Waiting for a reroll.


* jc/graph-post-root-gap (2013-12-30) 3 commits
 - WIP: document what we want at the end
 - graph: remove unused code a bit
 - graph: stuff the current commit into graph->columns[]

 . t1050: replace one instance of show-index with verify-pack
 . index-pack, pack-objects: allow creating .idx v2 with .pack v4
 . unpack-objects: decode v4 trees
 . unpack-objects: allow to save processed bytes to a buffer
 - ...

 Nico and Duy advancing the eternal vaporware pack-v4.  This is here
 primarily for wider distribution of the preview edition.

 Needs to be rebased, now the pack-bitmap series is in.


* tg/perf-lib-test-perf-cleanup (2013-09-19) 2 commits
 - perf-lib: add test_perf_cleanup target
 - perf-lib: split starting the test from the execution

 Add test_perf_cleanup shell function to the perf suite, that allows
 the script writers to define a test with a clean-up action.

 Will hold.


* jc/show-branch (2014-03-24) 5 commits
 - show-branch: use commit slab to represent bitflags of arbitrary width
 - show-branch.c: remove "all_mask"
 - show-branch.c: abstract out "flags" operation
 - show-branch.c: lift all_mask/all_revs to a global static
 - show-branch.c: update comment style

 Waiting for the final step to lift the hard-limit before sending it out.


* jh/submodule-tests (2014-04-17) 1 commit
 - t7410: 210 tests for various 'git submodule update' scenarios

 More or less abandoned.  Will drop.

 . *.sh: avoid hardcoding $GIT_DIR/hooks/...
 . git-sh-setup.sh: use rev-parse --git-path to get $GIT_DIR/objects
 . $GIT_COMMON_DIR: a new environment variable
 . commit: use SEQ_DIR instead of hardcoding "sequencer"
 . fast-import: use git_path() for accessing .git dir instead of get_git_dir()
 . reflog: avoid constructing .lock path with git_path
 . *.sh: respect $GIT_INDEX_FILE
 . git_path(): be aware of file relocation in $GIT_DIR
 . path.c: group git_path(), git_pathdup() and strbuf_git_path() together
 . path.c: rename vsnpath() to do_git_path()
 . git_snpath(): retire and replace with strbuf_git_path()
 . path.c: make get_pathname() call sites return const char *
 . path.c: make get_pathname() return strbuf instead of static buffer

 A replacement for contrib/workdir/git-new-workdir that does not
 rely on symbolic links and make sharing of objects and refs safer
 by making the borrowee and borrowers aware of each other.

 Portability workaround may be needed on top ($gmane/252496).
 Updates in response to review comments from Michael ($gmane/253033)
 may be needed for later parts, but the earlier parts look ready
 for 'next'.

 - patch-id: change default to stable

 Teaches "git patch-id" to compute the patch ID that does not change
 when the files in a single patch is reordered. As this new algorithm
 is backward incompatible, the last bit to flip it to be the default
 is left out of 'master' for now.

 Will hold.
