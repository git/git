What's cooking in git.git (Dec 2023, #04; Wed, 20)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and
aren't considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL
to a message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity (of course they can be resubmit when new interests
arise).

The 'maint' branch now points at the maintenance track of Git 2.43,
which was released earlier in the month, and the tip of 'next' has
been rewound and rebuilt on top of Git 2.43.  I am planning to start
ejecting topics that have been in the "stalled" state for too long.

The RelNotes symbolic link says we are now working towards Git 2.44.
It may not be a bad idea to reflect on what technical debt and UI
warts we have accumulated so far to see if we have enough of them to
start planning for a breaking Git 3.0 release (or, of course, keep
incrementally improve the system, which is much more preferrable---
continuity and stability is good).

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

* en/complete-sparse-checkout (2023-12-03) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2023-12-12 at 3de75bd6af)
 + completion: avoid user confusion in non-cone mode
 + completion: avoid misleading completions in cone mode
 + completion: fix logic for determining whether cone mode is active
 + completion: squelch stray errors in sparse-checkout completion

 Command line completion (in contrib/) learned to complete path
 arguments to the "add/set" subcommands of "git sparse-checkout"
 better.

* jc/revision-parse-int (2023-12-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2023-12-12 at 6209b4c97c)
 + revision: parse integer arguments to --max-count, --skip, etc., more carefully

 The command line parser for the "log" family of commands was too
 loose when parsing certain numbers, e.g., silently ignoring the
 extra 'q' in "git log -n 1q" without complaining, which has been
 tightened up.

* jk/bisect-reset-fix (2023-12-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2023-12-12 at 8f946eafb6)

 "git bisect reset" has been taught to clean up state files and refs
 even when BISECT_START file is gone.

 + config: reject bogus values for core.checkstat
 (this branch uses jk/implicit-true.)

  (merged to 'next' on 2023-12-12 at 4ae454b26d)
 + parse-options: decouple "--end-of-options" and "--"

 "git $cmd --end-of-options --rev -- --path" for some $cmd failed
 to interpret "--rev" as a rev, and "--path" as a path.  This was
 fixed for many programs like "reset" and "checkout".

 (this branch is used by jk/config-cleanup.)

 Some codepaths did not correctly parse configuration variables
 specified with valueless "true", which has been corrected.

 - revision.c: consult Bloom filters for root commits
 - t/t4216-log-bloom.sh: harden `test_bloom_filters_not_used()`

 The Bloom filter used for path limited history traversal was broken
 on systems whose "char" is unsigned; update the implementation and
 bump the format version to 2.

 Expecting a reroll.
