What's cooking in git.git (Sep 2022, #08; Tue, 27)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a future
release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and aren't
considered "accepted" at all.  A topic without enough support may be
discarded after a long period of no activity.

The -rc2 has been tagged for this cycle.  People are free to discuss
topics that has no relevance to the upcoming release, but we would
appreciate if they instead concentrated on finding and fixing recent
regressions in the upcoming release.  Even though I may be replacing
topics in 'seen' with their new iterations, I may not be picking up
patches on new topics to 'seen', until the final around the
beginning of the next month (cf. https://tinyurl.com/gitCal).  These
patches are welcome to come back in a more polished form after that
happens (read: discussions on them are not forbidden. just allow me
to leave my tree less distracted by new topics).

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
