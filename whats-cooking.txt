What's cooking in git.git (Dec 2014, #01; Wed, 3)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.

People, coming up with new topics is fine, but please pay attention
to what is going around the area you are touching. Does your topic
applied to either 'master' or 'maint' merge cleanly to 'next' and
'pu'?  If not, please coordinate with whoever is working in the same
area.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* jc/exec-cmd-system-path-leak-fix (2014-11-30) 1 commit
 - system_path(): always return free'able memory to the caller

 The function sometimes returned a non-freeable memory and some
 other times returned a piece of memory that must be freed.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jc/hook-cleanup (2014-12-01) 1 commit
 - run-command.c: retire unused run_hook_with_custom_index()

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/push-simple (2014-11-30) 1 commit
 - push: truly use "simple" as default, not "upstream"

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jn/rerere-fail-on-auto-update-failure (2014-12-03) 2 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - rerere: error out on autoupdate failure


* js/push-to-deploy (2014-11-30) 2 commits
 - t5516: more tests for receive.denyCurrentBranch=updateInstead
 - receive-pack: add another option for receive.denyCurrentBranch
 (this branch is used by jc/push-to-checkout.)

 "git push" into a repository with a working tree normally refuses
 to modify the branch that is checked out.  The command learned to
 optionally do an equivalent of "git reset --hard" only when there
 is no change to the working tree and the index instead, which would
 be useful to "deploy" by pushing into a repository.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jc/push-to-checkout (2014-12-01) 2 commits
 - receive-pack: support push-to-checkout hook
 - receive-pack: refactor updateInstead codepath
 (this branch uses js/push-to-deploy.)

 Extending the js/push-to-deploy topic, the behaviour of "git push"
 when updating the working tree and the index with an update to the
 branch that is checked out can be tweaked by push-to-checkout hook.

 Needs docs.


* lh/send-email-hide-x-mailer (2014-12-03) 2 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - send-email: add --[no-]xmailer option

 "git send-email" normally identifies itself via X-Mailer: header
 in the message it sends out.  A new command line flag allows the
 header to be squelched.


* nd/list-files (2014-12-01) 19 commits
 - list-files: -M aka diff-cached
 - list-files -F: show submodules with the new indicator '&'
 - list-files: add -F/--classify
 - list-files: show directories as well as files
 - list-files: do not show duplicate cached entries
 - list-files: sort output and remove duplicates
 - list-files: add -t back
 - list-files: add -1 short for --no-column
 - list-files: add -R/--recursive short for --max-depth=-1
 - list-files: -u does not imply showing stages
 - list-files: a user friendly version of ls-files and more
 - ls-files: support --max-depth
 - ls-files: add --column
 - ls-files: add --color to highlight file names
 - ls-files: buffer full item in strbuf before printing
 - ls_colors.c: highlight submodules like directories
 - ls_colors.c: add a function to color a file name
 - ls_colors.c: parse color.ls.* from config file
 - ls_colors.c: add $LS_COLORS parsing code

 A new "git list-files" Porcelain command, "ls-files" with bells and
 whistles.


* nd/ls-tree-pathspec (2014-12-01) 5 commits
 - t3102: style modernization
 - t3102: document that ls-tree does not yet support negated pathspec
 - ls-tree: disable negative pathspec because it's not supported
 - ls-tree: remove path filtering logic in show_tree
 - tree.c: update read_tree_recursive callback to pass strbuf as base

 "git ls-tree" does not support path selection based on negative
 pathspecs, but did not error out when negative pathspecs are given.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* rj/t0050-passes (2014-11-30) 1 commit
 - t0050-*.sh: mark the rename (case change) test as passing

 Will merge to 'next'.


* rt/for-each-ref-spell-tcl-as-Tcl (2014-11-30) 1 commit
 - for-each-ref: correct spelling of Tcl in option description

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sb/ref-transaction-reflog (2014-12-03) 2 commits
 - refs.c: rename transaction.updates to transaction.ref_updates
 - refs.c: rename the transaction functions
 (this branch uses sb/ref-transaction-unify-to-update.)

 Still under review discussion.


* ye/http-accept-language (2014-12-03) 2 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - http: send Accept-Language header if possible

 Still under review discussion.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* ms/submodule-update-config-doc (2014-11-03) 1 commit
 - submodule: clarify documentation for update subcommand

 Needs a reroll ($gmane/259037).


* je/quiltimport-no-fuzz (2014-10-21) 2 commits
 - git-quiltimport: flip the default not to allow fuzz
 - git-quiltimport.sh: allow declining fuzz with --exact option

 "quiltimport" drove "git apply" always with -C1 option to reduce
 context of the patch in order to give more chance to somewhat stale
 patches to apply.  Add an "--exact" option to disable, and also
 "-C$n" option to customize this behaviour.  The top patch
 optionally flips the default to "--exact".

 Tired of waiting for an Ack; will discard.


* jc/push-cert-hmac-optim (2014-09-25) 2 commits
 - receive-pack: truncate hmac early and convert only necessary bytes
 - sha1_to_hex: split out "hex-format n bytes" helper and use it

 This is "we could do this if we wanted to", not "we measured and it
 improves performance critical codepath".

 Will perhaps drop.


* mt/patch-id-stable (2014-06-10) 1 commit
 - patch-id: change default to stable

 Teaches "git patch-id" to compute the patch ID that does not change
 when the files in a single patch is reordered. As this new algorithm
 is backward incompatible, the last bit to flip it to be the default
 is left out of 'master' for now.

 Nobody seems to be jumping up & down requesting this last step,
 which makes the result somewhat backward incompatible.
 Will perhaps drop.


* tr/remerge-diff (2014-11-10) 9 commits
 - t4213: avoid "|" in sed regexp
 - log --remerge-diff: show what the conflict resolution changed
 - name-hash: allow dir hashing even when !ignore_case
 - merge-recursive: allow storing conflict hunks in index
 - merge_diff_mode: fold all merge diff variants into an enum
 - combine-diff: do not pass revs->dense_combined_merges redundantly
 - merge-recursive: -Xindex-only to leave worktree unchanged
 - merge-recursive: internal flag to avoid touching the worktree
 - merge-recursive: remove dead conditional in update_stages()

 "log -p" output learns a new way to let users inspect a merge
 commit by showing the differences between the automerged result
 with conflicts the person who recorded the merge would have seen
 and the final conflict resolution that was recorded in the merge.

 Waiting for a reroll ($gmane/256591).


* hv/submodule-config (2014-11-11) 4 commits
 - do not die on error of parsing fetchrecursesubmodules option
 - use new config API for worktree configurations of submodules
 - extract functions for submodule config set and lookup
 - implement submodule config cache for lookup of submodule names

 Kicked back to 'pu' per request ($gmane/255610).


* ab/add-interactive-show-diff-func-name (2014-05-12) 2 commits
 - SQUASH??? git-add--interactive: Preserve diff heading when splitting hunks
 - git-add--interactive: Preserve diff heading when splitting hunks

 Waiting for a reroll.


* jn/gitweb-utf8-in-links (2014-05-27) 1 commit
 - gitweb: Harden UTF-8 handling in generated links

 $gmane/250758?


* ss/userdiff-update-csharp-java (2014-06-02) 2 commits
 - userdiff: support Java try keyword
 - userdiff: support C# async methods and correct C# keywords

 Reviews sent; waiting for a response.


* bg/rebase-off-of-previous-branch (2014-04-16) 1 commit
 - git-rebase: print name of rev when using shorthand

 Teach "git rebase -" to report the concrete name of the branch
 (i.e. the previous one).

 But it stops short and does not do the same for "git rebase @{-1}".
 Expecting a reroll.


* rb/merge-prepare-commit-msg-hook (2014-01-10) 4 commits
 - merge: drop unused arg from abort_commit method signature
 - merge: make prepare_to_commit responsible for write_merge_state
 - t7505: ensure cleanup after hook blocks merge
 - t7505: add missing &&

 Expose more merge states (e.g. $GIT_DIR/MERGE_MODE) to hooks that
 run during "git merge".  The log message stresses too much on one
 hook, prepare-commit-msg, but it would equally apply to other hooks
 like post-merge, I think.

 Waiting for a reroll.


* jc/graph-post-root-gap (2013-12-30) 3 commits
 - WIP: document what we want at the end
 - graph: remove unused code a bit
 - graph: stuff the current commit into graph->columns[]

 This was primarily a RFH ($gmane/239580).


* tg/perf-lib-test-perf-cleanup (2013-09-19) 2 commits
 - perf-lib: add test_perf_cleanup target
 - perf-lib: split starting the test from the execution

 Add test_perf_cleanup shell function to the perf suite, that allows
 the script writers to define a test with a clean-up action.

 Will hold.


* jc/show-branch (2014-03-24) 5 commits
 - show-branch: use commit slab to represent bitflags of arbitrary width
 - show-branch.c: remove "all_mask"
 - show-branch.c: abstract out "flags" operation
 - show-branch.c: lift all_mask/all_revs to a global static
 - show-branch.c: update comment style

 Waiting for the final step to lift the hard-limit before sending it out.

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* jk/pack-bitmap (2014-11-30) 1 commit
 - pack-bitmap: do not use gcc packed attribute

 Will merge to 'next'.


* nd/multiple-work-trees (2014-12-01) 34 commits
 - git-common-dir: make "modules/" per-working-directory directory
 - checkout: do not fail if target is an empty directory

 - setup.c: convert is_git_directory() to use strbuf
 - git-stash: avoid hardcoding $GIT_DIR/logs/....
 - *.sh: avoid hardcoding $GIT_DIR/hooks/...
 - git-sh-setup.sh: use rev-parse --git-path to get $GIT_DIR/objects
 - $GIT_COMMON_DIR: a new environment variable
 - commit: use SEQ_DIR instead of hardcoding "sequencer"
 - fast-import: use git_path() for accessing .git dir instead of get_git_dir()
 - reflog: avoid constructing .lock path with git_path
 - *.sh: respect $GIT_INDEX_FILE
 - git_path(): be aware of file relocation in $GIT_DIR
 - path.c: group git_path(), git_pathdup() and strbuf_git_path() together
 - path.c: rename vsnpath() to do_git_path()
 - git_snpath(): retire and replace with strbuf_git_path()
 - path.c: make get_pathname() call sites return const char *
 - path.c: make get_pathname() return strbuf instead of static buffer

 A replacement for contrib/workdir/git-new-workdir that does not
 rely on symbolic links and make sharing of objects and refs safer
 by making the borrowee and borrowers aware of each other.

 A few tests need some tweaks for MinGW ($gmane/{257756,257757}).
 Conflicts with rs/ref-transaction so ejected for now, waiting for a
 reroll.

 - copy.c: make copy_fd preserve meaningful errno

 Jonathan seems to be working in the same area, having a moral
 equivalent.  Have to drop either this or the other one.


* sb/log-ref-write-fd (2014-11-20) 1 commit

 Moves a part of function around to add a helper that still only has

 conflicts with nd/multiple-work-trees.

  (merged to 'next' on 2014-11-14 at 3c11a1b)
 + approxidate: allow ISO-like dates far in the future
 + pass TIME_DATE_NOW to approxidate future-check

 Traditionally we tried to avoid interpreting date strings given by
 the user as future dates, e.g. GIT_COMMITTER_DATE=2014-12-10 when
 used early November 2014 was taken as "October 12, 2014" because it
 is likely that a date in the future, December 10, is a mistake.

 Loosen this and do not tiebreak by future-ness of the date when

 (1) ISO-like format is used, and
 (2) the string can make sense interpreted as both y-m-d and y-d-m.

* tq/git-ssh-command (2014-11-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-11-14 at 83f5dae)
 + git_connect: set ssh shell command in GIT_SSH_COMMAND

 Allow passing extra set of arguments when ssh is invoked to create
 an encrypted & authenticated connection, which is not possible with
 existing GIT_SSH mechanism, which was designed more to match what
 other programs with similar variables did, not necessarily to be
 more useful.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* nd/lockfile-absolute (2014-11-03) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-11-06 at 68722a9)
 + lockfile.c: store absolute path

 The lockfile API can get confused which file to clean up when the
 process moved the $cwd after creating a lockfile.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* jh/empty-notes (2014-11-14) 9 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-11-18 at 9eeb338)
 + t3301: modernize style
 + notes: empty notes should be shown by 'git log'
 + builtin/notes: add --allow-empty, to allow storing empty notes
 + builtin/notes: split create_note() to clarify add vs. remove logic
 + builtin/notes: simplify early exit code in add()
 + builtin/notes: refactor note file path into struct note_data
 + builtin/notes: improve naming
 + t3301: verify that 'git notes' removes empty notes by default
 + builtin/notes: fix premature failure when trying to add the empty blob

 A request to store an empty note via "git notes" meant to remove
 note from the object but with --allow-empty we will store a (surprise!)
 note that is empty.  In the longer run, we might want to deprecate
 the somewhat unintuitive "emptying means deletion" behaviour.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/merge-bases (2014-10-30) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-11-06 at 491e576)

  (merged to 'next' on 2014-10-29 at 9167582)
 + strbuf_add_commented_lines(): avoid SP-HT sequence in commented lines

 The commented output used to blindly add a SP before the payload
 line, resulting in "# \t<indented text>\n" when the payload began
 with a HT.  Instead, produce "#\t<indented text>\n".

 + checkout: report upstream correctly even with loosely defined branch.*.merge

 The report from "git checkout" on a branch that builds on another
 local branch by setting its branch.*.merge to branch name (not a
 full refname) incorrectly said that the upstream is gone.
