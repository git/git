What's cooking in git.git (Jun 2020, #04; Mon, 22)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'seen' (formerly 'pu'---proposed updates) while commits prefixed
with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

A few topiocs have graduated to 'master'.  As I expect that the next
week would be slower than usual due to being summer (and folks in US
having holidays), I am hoping that I can merge down a handful more
topics from 'next', perhaps with shorter gestation period than
usual, by the end of this week.

The 'pu' (proposed updates) branch has been renamed to 'seen' to use
a more meaningful name (after all, the purpose of it is not to
contain all proposals, but to merely serve as a place to park what
the maintainer happened to have seen) and more importantly, to make
room for topics from those contributors whose two-letter name
abbreviation needs to be 'pu' under 'pu/$topicName'.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches of the
repositories listed at

  (merged to 'next' on 2020-06-17 at 3521be3834)

* dr/push-remoteref-fix (2020-04-23) 1 commit
 - remote.c: fix handling of %(push:remoteref)

 The "%(push:remoteref)" placeholder in the "--format=" argument of
 "git format-patch" (and friends) only showed what got explicitly
 configured, not what ref at the receiving end would be updated when
 "git push" was used, as it ignored the default behaviour (e.g. update
 the same ref as the source).

 Expecting a reroll.
 cf. <20200416152145.wp2zeibxmuyas6y6@feanor>

 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

* ct/diff-with-merge-base-clarification (2020-06-12) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-06-17 at e0b54a001c)
 + Documentation: usage for diff combined commits
 + git diff: improve range handling
 + t/t3430: avoid undefined git diff behavior

 "git diff" used to take arguments in random and nonsense range
 notation, e.g. "git diff A..B C", "git diff A..B C...D", etc.,
 which has been cleaned up.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* js/default-branch-name (2020-06-19) 8 commits

 The name of the primary branch in existing repositories, and the
 default name used for the first branch in newly created
 repositories, is made configurable, so that we can eventually wean
 ourselves off of the hardcoded 'master'.

 Expecting a reroll.

 + http: refactor finish_http_pack_request()
 + http: use --stdin when indexing dumb HTTP pack

 The "fetch/clone" protocol has been updated to allow the server to
 instruct the clients to grab pre-packaged packfile(s) in addition
 to the packed object data coming over the wire.

 Will merge to 'master'.

  (merged to 'next' on 2020-06-19 at 02bf7a9d8c)
 + check_repository_format_gently(): refuse extensions for old repositories
 + sparse-checkout: upgrade repository to version 1 when enabling extension
 + fetch: allow adding a filter after initial clone
 + repository: add a helper function to perform repository format upgrade

 Allow runtime upgrade of the repository format version, which needs

 last step of this series, but it is the right thing to do in the
 longer term.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 has been implemented and integrated for improved performance and
 atomicity.

 Does not seem to play well with the xl/upgrade-repo-format topic;
 perhaps rework on top of 'master' after that topic graduates?
