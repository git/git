What's cooking in git.git (Mar 2024, #05; Tue, 19)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and
aren't considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL
to a message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity (of course they can be resubmit when new interests
arise).

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/

 "false" and its synonyms are taken as "no".

 give the --allow-empty option, which was unnecessary.  Its UI has

 - t/Makefile: run unit tests alongside shell tests
 - unit tests: add rule for running with test-tool
 - test-tool run-command testsuite: support unit tests
 - test-tool run-command testsuite: remove hardcoded filter
 - test-tool run-command testsuite: get shell from env
 - t0080: turn t-basic unit test into a helper
 - Merge branch 'jk/unit-tests-buildfix' into js/unit-test-suite-runner
 (this branch is used by js/cmake-with-test-tool.)

 The "test-tool" has been taught to run testsuite tests in parallel,
 bypassing the need to use the "prove" tool.

 Needs review.

 - completion: dir-type optargs for am, format-patch

 Command line completion support (in contrib/) has been
 updated for a few commands to complete directory names where a
 directory name is expected.

 Expecting a reroll.

* bk/complete-send-email (2024-01-12) 1 commit
 - completion: don't complete revs when --no-format-patch

 Command line completion support (in contrib/) has been taught to
 avoid offering revision names as candidates to "git send-email" when
 the command is used to send pre-generated files.

 Expecting a reroll.

* tb/path-filter-fix (2024-01-31) 16 commits
 - bloom: introduce `deinit_bloom_filters()`
 - commit-graph: reuse existing Bloom filters where possible
 - object.h: fix mis-aligned flag bits table
 - commit-graph: new Bloom filter version that fixes murmur3
 - commit-graph: unconditionally load Bloom filters
 - bloom: prepare to discard incompatible Bloom filters
 - bloom: annotate filters with hash version
 - repo-settings: introduce commitgraph.changedPathsVersion
 - t4216: test changed path filters with high bit paths
 - t/helper/test-read-graph: implement `bloom-filters` mode
 - bloom.h: make `load_bloom_filter_from_graph()` public
 - t/helper/test-read-graph.c: extract `dump_graph_info()`
 - gitformat-commit-graph: describe version 2 of BDAT
 - commit-graph: ensure Bloom filters are read with consistent settings
 - revision.c: consult Bloom filters for root commits
 - t/t4216-log-bloom.sh: harden `test_bloom_filters_not_used()`

 The Bloom filter used for path limited history traversal was broken
 on systems whose "char" is unsigned; update the implementation and
 bump the format version to 2.

 Waiting for a final ack?
