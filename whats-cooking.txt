What's cooking in git.git (Jul 2024, #05; Tue, 16)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and
aren't considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL
to a message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity (of course they can be resubmit when new interests
arise).

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-scm/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/

* jc/patch-id (2024-06-21) 5 commits
 - patch-id: tighten code to detect the patch header
 - patch-id: rewrite code that detects the beginning of a patch
 - patch-id: make get_one_patchid() more extensible
 - patch-id: call flush_current_id() only when needed
 - t4204: patch-id supports various input format

 The patch parser in "git patch-id" has been tightened to avoid
 getting confused by lines that look like a patch header in the log
 message.

 Needs review.

 + add-patch: handle splitting hunks with diff.suppressBlankEmpty

 When the diff.suppressBlankEmpty configuration variable is set,
 "git add -p" failed to process a patch with an unmodified empty
 line, which has been corrected.

 Reverted out of 'next'.
