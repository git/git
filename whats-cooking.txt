What's cooking in git.git (Nov 2018, #01; Thu, 1)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

Two groups of "rewrite rebase/rebase-i in C" topics, together with a
handful of associated fix-up topics to them, will all be merged to
'master' tomorrow.  Some of them haven't spent as much time as usual
in 'next', so there still may be rough edges, but let's make sure we
find them and smooth them out before the release.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

 + doc: document diff/merge.guitool config keys
 + completion: support `git mergetool --[no-]gui`
 + mergetool: accept -g/--[no-]gui as arguments

 "git mergetool" learned to take the "--[no-]gui" option, just like

* jc/receive-deny-current-branch-fix (2018-10-19) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-26 at 2975c42215)
 + receive: denyCurrentBranch=updateinstead should not blindly update

 The receive.denyCurrentBranch=updateInstead codepath kicked in even
 when the push should have been rejected due to other reasons, such
 as it does not fast-forward or the update-hook rejects it, which
 has been corrected.


* jk/run-command-notdot (2018-10-25) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-26 at 9d9335b23f)
 + t0061: adjust to test-tool transition

  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-26 at 6b2d004194)
 + diff: don't attempt to strip prefix from absolute Windows paths

 Under certain circumstances, "git diff D:/a/b/c D:/a/b/d" on
 Windows would strip initial parts from the paths because they
 were not recognized as absolute, which has been corrected.


* js/mingw-getcwd (2018-10-24) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-26 at f31abc8d8f)
 + mingw: fix getcwd when the parent directory cannot be queried

 A mutex used in "git pack-objects" were not correctly initialized
 and this caused "git repack" to dump core on Windows.

  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-25 at af387d8978)
 + range-diff: allow to diff files regardless of submodule config

 "git range-diff" did not work well when the compared ranges had
 changes in submodules and the "--submodule=log" was used.


* md/filter-trees (2018-10-18) 10 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-18 at 55be2fded9)

* rv/send-email-cc-misc-by (2018-10-16) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-19 at 2c1e5f75af)
 + send-email: also pick up cc addresses from -by trailers
 + send-email: only consider lines containing @ or <> for automatic Cc'ing
 + Documentation/git-send-email.txt: style fixes

 "git send-email" learned to grab address-looking string on any
 trailer whose name ends with "-by"; --suppress-cc=misc-by on the
 command line, or setting sendemail.suppresscc configuration
 variable to "misc-by", can be used to disable this behaviour.


* sb/strbuf-h-update (2018-09-29) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-26 at e4ad935cb0)
 + strbuf.h: format according to coding guidelines

 Belated documentation update to adjust to a new world order that
 happened a yew years ago.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* ab/push-dwim-dst (2018-10-29) 9 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - push doc: document the DWYM behavior pushing to unqualified <dst>
 - push: add DWYM support for "git push refs/remotes/...:<dst>"
 - push: test that <src> doesn't DWYM if <dst> is unqualified
 - push: add an advice on unqualified <dst> push
 - push: move unqualified refname error into a function
 - push: improve the error shown on unqualified <dst> push
 - i18n: remote.c: mark error(...) messages for translation
 - remote.c: add braces in anticipation of a follow-up change

 "git push $there $src:$dst" rejects when $dst is not a fully
 qualified refname and not clear what the end user meant.  The
 codepath has been taught to give a clearer error message, and also
 guess where the push should go by taking the type of the pushed
 object into account (e.g. a tag object would want to go under
 refs/tags/).

 The last few steps are questionable.

* cb/printf-empty-format (2018-10-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-01 at 9fcb05f22c)
 + sequencer: cleanup for gcc warning in non developer mode
 (this branch uses ag/rebase-i-in-c; is tangled with ag/sequencer-reduce-rewriting-todo, js/rebase-autostash-fix, js/rebase-i-break, js/rebase-i-shortopt, js/rebase-in-c-5.5-work-with-rebase-i-in-c and pk/rebase-in-c-6-final.)

 Build fix for a topic in flight.

 Will merge to 'master' together with pk/rebase-in-c-6-final.


* md/list-lazy-objects-fix (2018-10-29) 1 commit
 - list-objects.c: don't segfault for missing cmdline objects

 "git rev-list --exclude-promissor-objects" had to take an object
 that does not exist locally (and is lazily available) from the
 command line without barfing, but the code dereferenced NULL.

 That sympotom may be worth addressing, but I think the "fix" is
 overly broad and is wrong.  Giving a missing object should be
 diagnosed as an error, not swept under the rug silently.


* nd/i18n (2018-10-29) 12 commits
 - fsck: mark strings for translation
 - parse-options.c: mark more strings for translation
 - parse-options: replace opterror() with optname()

 - attr.c: mark more string for translation
 - archive.c: mark more strings for translation

 - attr.c: remove #ifdef NO_PTHREADS
 - name-hash.c: remove #ifdef NO_PTHREADS
 - index-pack: remove #ifdef NO_PTHREADS
 - thread-utils: macros to unconditionally compile pthreads API

 The codebase has been cleaned up to reduce "#ifndef NO_PTHREADS".


* nd/wildmatch-double-asterisk (2018-10-29) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-01 at 627186d020)
 + wildmatch: change behavior of "foo**bar" in WM_PATHNAME mode

 A pattern with '**' that does not have a slash on either side used
 to be an invalid one, but the code now treats such double-asterisks
 the same way as two normal asterisks that happen to be adjacent to
 each other.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* rj/header-cleanup (2018-10-29) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-01 at 975e56048f)

* bp/refresh-index-using-preload (2018-10-30) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-01 at 289e6bcece)
 + speed up refresh_index() by utilizing preload_index()

 The helper function to refresh the cached stat information in the
 in-core index has learned to perform the lstat() part of the
 operation in parallel on multi-core platforms.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* sg/test-verbose-log (2018-10-30) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-01 at 0c4a18a71f)
 + test-lib: introduce the '-V' short option for '--verbose-log'

 Our test scripts can now take the '-V' option as a synonym for the
 '--verbose-log' option.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ab/pack-tests-cleanup (2018-10-31) 3 commits
 - index-pack tests: don't leave test repo dirty at end
 - pack-objects tests: don't leave test .git corrupt at end
 - pack-objects test: modernize style

 A couple of tests used to leave the repository in a state that is
 deliberately corrupt, which have been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 A regression in Git 2.12 era made "git fsck" fall into an infinite
 loop while processing truncated loose objects.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/proto-v2-ref-prefix-fix (2018-10-31) 2 commits
 - ls-remote: pass heads/tags prefixes to transport
 - ls-remote: do not send ref prefixes for patterns

 "git ls-remote $there foo" was broken by recent update for the
 protocol v2 and stopped showing refs that match 'foo' that are not
 refs/{heads,tags}/foo, which has been fixed.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/stream-pack-non-delta-clarification (2018-10-31) 1 commit
 - read_istream_pack_non_delta(): document input handling

 Additional comment on a tricky piece of code to help developers.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 A new date format "--date=human" that morphs its output depending
 on how far the time is from the current time has been introduced.
 "--date=auto" can be used to use this new format when the output is
 goint to the pager or to the terminal and otherwise the default
 format.

 (this branch uses bp/reset-quiet and js/mingw-http-ssl; is tangled with jc/http-curlver-warnings.)

 Split the overly large Documentation/config.txt file into million
 little pieces.  This potentially allows each individual piece
 included into the manual page of the command it affects more easily.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 This is a painful conversions while many other topics in flight
 wants to add to or edit the documentation of configuration
 variables.


* nd/per-worktree-config (2018-10-22) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-01 at 3746343ca8)
 + worktree: add per-worktree config files
 + t1300: extract and use test_cmp_config()

 A fourth class of configuration files (in addition to the
 traditional "system wide", "per user in the $HOME directory" and
 "per repository in the $GIT_DIR/config") has been introduced so
 that different worktrees that share the same repository (hence the
 same $GIT_DIR/config file) can use different customization.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* nd/submodule-unused-vars (2018-10-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-29 at 33641dcc89)

 Trivial bugfix.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ag/rev-parse-all-exclude-fix (2018-11-01) 1 commit
 - rev-parse: clear --exclude list after 'git rev-parse --all'

 "git rev-parse --exclude=* --branches --branches"  (i.e. first
 saying "add only things that do not match '*' out of all branches"
 and then adding all branches, without any exclusion this time")
 worked as expected, but "--exclude=* --all --all" did not work the
 same way, which has been fixed.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* bp/reset-quiet (2018-10-24) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-29 at 71f4fbc802)
 + reset: warn when refresh_index() takes more than 2 seconds
 + reset: add new reset.quiet config setting
 + reset: don't compute unstaged changes after reset when --quiet
 (this branch is used by nd/config-split.)

 "git reset --quiet" no longer runs "update-index --refresh"
 internally, which shifts the refresh cost away from the command.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* js/rebase-autostash-fix (2018-10-24) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-29 at 680e648001)
 + rebase --autostash: fix issue with dirty submodules
 + rebase --autostash: demonstrate a problem with dirty submodules
 + rebase (autostash): use an explicit OID to apply the stash
 + rebase (autostash): store the full OID in <state-dir>/autostash
 + rebase (autostash): avoid duplicate call to state_dir_path()
 (this branch uses ag/rebase-i-in-c, js/rebase-in-c-5.5-work-with-rebase-i-in-c, pk/rebase-in-c, pk/rebase-in-c-2-basic, pk/rebase-in-c-3-acts, pk/rebase-in-c-4-opts, pk/rebase-in-c-5-test and pk/rebase-in-c-6-final; is tangled with ag/sequencer-reduce-rewriting-todo, cb/printf-empty-format, jc/rebase-in-c-5-test-typofix, js/rebase-i-break and js/rebase-i-shortopt.)

 "git rebase" that has recently been rewritten in C had a few issues
 in its "--autstash" feature, which have been corrected.

* js/remote-archive-dwimfix (2018-10-26) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-26 at f5bf6946bd)
 + archive: initialize archivers earlier

 The logic to determine the archive type "git archive" uses did not
 correctly kick in for "git archive --remote", which has been
 corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* js/shallow-and-fetch-prune (2018-10-25) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-26 at 93b7196560)
 + repack -ad: prune the list of shallow commits
 + shallow: offer to prune only non-existing entries
 + repack: point out a bug handling stale shallow info

 "git repack" in a shallow clone did not correctly update the
 shallow points in the repository, leading to a repository that
 does not pass fsck.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jw/send-email-no-auth (2018-10-23) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-29 at a3fbbdb889)
 + send-email: explicitly disable authentication

 "git send-email" learned to disable SMTP authentication via the
 "--smtp-auth=none" option, even when the smtp username is given
 (which turns the authentication on by default).

 Will merge to 'master'.


* md/exclude-promisor-objects-fix (2018-10-23) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-29 at fb36a5dcbe)
 + exclude-promisor-objects: declare when option is allowed
 + Documentation/git-log.txt: do not show --exclude-promisor-objects

 Operations on promisor objects make sense in the context of only a
 small subset of the commands that internally use the revisions
 machinery, but the "--exclude-promisor-objects" option were taken
 and led to nonsense results by commands like "log", to which it
 didn't make much sense.  This has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* mg/gpg-fingerprint (2018-10-23) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-26 at 1e219cb754)
 + gpg-interface.c: obtain primary key fingerprint as well
 + gpg-interface.c: support getting key fingerprint via %GF format
 + gpg-interface.c: use flags to determine key/signer info presence
 (this branch uses mg/gpg-parse-tighten; is tangled with jc/gpg-cocci-preincr.)

 New "--pretty=format:" placeholders %GF and %GP that show the GPG
 key fingerprints have been invented.

 Will merge to 'master'.

  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-26 at 870e125cec)

 (this branch uses js/mingw-http-ssl; is tangled with nd/config-split.)

 Warning message fix.

 Will merge to 'master'.

* js/rebase-i-shortopt (2018-10-26) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-11-01 at 4e9da19145)

 (this branch uses ag/rebase-i-in-c and js/rebase-i-break; is tangled with ag/sequencer-reduce-rewriting-todo, cb/printf-empty-format, js/rebase-autostash-fix, js/rebase-in-c-5.5-work-with-rebase-i-in-c and pk/rebase-in-c-6-final.)

 "git rebase -i" learned to take 'b' as the short form of 'break'
 option in the todo list.

 + upload-pack: clear flags before each v2 request
 + upload-pack: make want_obj not global
 + upload-pack: make have_obj not global

 "git fetch" over protocol v2 into a shallow repository failed to
 fetch full history behind a new tip of history that was diverged
 before the cut-off point of the history that was previously fetched
 shallowly.

 - am: improve author-script error reporting
 - am: don't die in read_author_script()

 Unify code to read the author-script used in "git am" and the

  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-29 at 4264c150cb)
 + submodule helper: convert relative URL to absolute URL if needed

 Some codepaths failed to form a proper URL when .gitmodules record
 the URL to a submodule repository as relative to the repository of
 superproject, which has been corrected.

 (this branch is used by jc/http-curlver-warnings and nd/config-split.)

 On platforms with recent cURL library, http.sslBackend configuration
 variable can be used to choose a different SSL backend at runtime.
 The Windows port uses this mechanism to switch between OpenSSL and
 Secure Channel while talking over the HTTPS protocol.

  (merged to 'next' on 2018-10-19 at 6db9b14495)

 "git rebase -i" learned a new insn, 'break', that the user can
 insert in the to-do list.  Upon hitting it, the command returns
 control back to the user.

 + archive: allow archive over HTTP(S) with proto v2
 + archive: implement protocol v2 archive command
 + archive: use packet_reader for communications
 + archive: follow test standards around assertions

 The original implementation of "git archive --remote" more or less
 bypassed the transport layer and did not work over http(s).  The
 version 2 of the protocol is defined to allow going over http(s) as
 well as Git native transport.

 Will hold.

 (this branch uses ag/rebase-i-in-c; is tangled with cb/printf-empty-format, js/rebase-autostash-fix, js/rebase-i-break, js/rebase-i-shortopt, js/rebase-in-c-5.5-work-with-rebase-i-in-c and pk/rebase-in-c-6-final.)

 The scripted version of "git rebase -i" wrote and rewrote the todo
 list many times during a single step of its operation, and the
 recent C-rewrite made a faithful conversion of the logic to C.  The
 implementation has been updated to carry necessary information
 around in-core to avoid rewriting the same file over and over
 unnecessarily.

 A reroll exists but is based on a stale codebase and is painful to

 The code to traverse objects for reachability, used to decide what
 objects are unreferenced and expendable, have been taught to also
 consider per-worktree refs of other worktrees as starting points to
 prevent data loss.

* pw/add-p-select (2018-07-26) 4 commits
 - add -p: optimize line selection for short hunks
 - add -p: allow line selection to be inverted
 - add -p: select modified lines correctly
 - add -p: select individual hunk lines

 "git add -p" interactive interface learned to let users choose
 individual added/removed lines to be used in the operation, instead
 of accepting or rejecting a whole hunk.

 Will discard.
 No further feedbacks on the topic for quite some time.

 I found the feature to be hard to explain, and may result in more
 end-user complaints, but let's see.

 + alias: detect loops in mixed execution mode

 Two (or more) aliases that mutually refer to each other can form an
 infinite loop; we now attempt to notice and stop.

 Discarded.
