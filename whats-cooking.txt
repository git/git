What's cooking in git.git (Sep 2014, #06; Wed, 24)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* nd/archive-pathspec (2014-09-22) 1 commit
 - archive: support filtering paths with glob

 "git archive" learned to filter what gets archived with pathspec.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* rs/graph-simplify (2014-09-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-23 at 72969e2)

 Will merge to 'master'.


* sb/merge-recursive-copy-paste-fix (2014-09-23) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-24 at b8dfbef)
 + merge-recursive: remove stale commented debugging code
 + merge-recursive: fix copy-paste mistake

 "git merge-recursive" had a small bug that could have made it
 mishandle "one side deleted, the other side did not touch it" in a
 rare corner case, where the other side actually did touch to cause
 the blob object names to be different but both blobs before and
 after the change normalize to the same (e.g. correcting mistake to
 check in a blob with CRLF line endings by replacing it with another
 blob that records the same contents with LF line endings).

 Will merge to 'master'.

 (this branch is used by jt/timer-settime.)

 Split the early part of jt/timer-settime topic out into a topic.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 "log -p" output learns a new way to let users inspect a merge
 commit by showing the differences between the automerged result
 with conflicts the person who recorded the merge would have seen
 and the final conflict resolution that was recorded in the merge.

 Review comments sent.

 Update the way the "difftool --help" shows the help message that is
 shared with the "mergetool" to reduce one shell dependency.

 Will be rerolled.

 Waiting for a reroll.


* jn/gitweb-utf8-in-links (2014-05-27) 1 commit
 - gitweb: Harden UTF-8 handling in generated links

 $gmane/250758?


* rh/prompt-tests (2014-06-05) 11 commits

 Expecting a reroll to limit the damage to test_eval_; also reported
 to be broken with older zsh that are still in the field ($gmane/251231).


* ss/userdiff-update-csharp-java (2014-06-02) 2 commits
 - userdiff: support Java try keyword
 - userdiff: support C# async methods and correct C# keywords

 Reviews sent; waiting for a response.


* bg/rebase-off-of-previous-branch (2014-04-16) 1 commit
 - git-rebase: print name of rev when using shorthand

 Teach "git rebase -" to report the concrete name of the branch
 (i.e. the previous one).

 But it stops short and does not do the same for "git rebase @{-1}".
 Expecting a reroll.


* jk/makefile (2014-02-05) 16 commits
 . FIXUP
 . move LESS/LV pager environment to Makefile
 . Makefile: teach scripts to include make variables
 . FIXUP
 . Makefile: auto-build C strings from make variables

 . Makefile: introduce make-var helper function
 . Makefile: fix git-instaweb dependency on gitweb
 . Makefile: drop USE_GETTEXT_SCHEME from GIT-CFLAGS

 Simplify the Makefile rules and macros that exist primarily for
 quoting purposes, and make it easier to robustly express the
 dependency rules.

 Expecting a reroll.


* po/everyday-doc (2014-01-27) 1 commit
 - Make 'git help everyday' work

 This may make the said command to emit something, but the source is
 not meant to be formatted into a manual pages to begin with, and
 also its contents are a bit stale.  It may be a good first step in
 the right direction, but needs more work to at least get the
 mark-up right before public consumption.

 Waiting for a reroll (thread ending at $gmane/254746)


* rb/merge-prepare-commit-msg-hook (2014-01-10) 4 commits
 - merge: drop unused arg from abort_commit method signature
 - merge: make prepare_to_commit responsible for write_merge_state
 - t7505: ensure cleanup after hook blocks merge
 - t7505: add missing &&

 Expose more merge states (e.g. $GIT_DIR/MERGE_MODE) to hooks that
 run during "git merge".  The log message stresses too much on one
 hook, prepare-commit-msg, but it would equally apply to other hooks
 like post-merge, I think.

 Waiting for a reroll.


* jc/graph-post-root-gap (2013-12-30) 3 commits
 - WIP: document what we want at the end
 - graph: remove unused code a bit
 - graph: stuff the current commit into graph->columns[]

 This was primarily a RFH ($gmane/239580).


* tg/perf-lib-test-perf-cleanup (2013-09-19) 2 commits
 - perf-lib: add test_perf_cleanup target
 - perf-lib: split starting the test from the execution

 Add test_perf_cleanup shell function to the perf suite, that allows
 the script writers to define a test with a clean-up action.

 Will hold.


* jc/show-branch (2014-03-24) 5 commits
 - show-branch: use commit slab to represent bitflags of arbitrary width
 - show-branch.c: remove "all_mask"
 - show-branch.c: abstract out "flags" operation
 - show-branch.c: lift all_mask/all_revs to a global static
 - show-branch.c: update comment style

 Waiting for the final step to lift the hard-limit before sending it out.

[Cooking]

* jk/faster-name-conflicts (2014-09-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-19 at 34d2840)
 + refs: speed up is_refname_available

 Optimize the check to see if a ref $F can be created by making sure
 no existing ref has $F/ as its prefix, which especially matters in
 a repository with a large number of existing refs.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/write-packed-refs-via-stdio (2014-09-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-19 at f1e94fb)
 + refs: write packed_refs file using stdio

 Optimize the code path to write out the packed-refs file, which
 especially matters in a repository with a large number of refs.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* da/include-compat-util-first-in-c (2014-09-15) 4 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - check-headers: add header usage checks for .c files

  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-23 at 5ed184a)
 + stash: prefer --quiet over shell redirection of the standard error stream
 + refs: make rev-parse --quiet actually quiet
 + t1503: use test_must_be_empty
 + Documentation: a note about stdout for git rev-parse --verify --quiet

 "rev-parse --verify --quiet $name" is meant to quietly exit with a
 non-zero status when $name is not a valid object name, but still
 gave error messages in some cases.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* hj/pretty-naked-decoration (2014-09-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-23 at fb699c4)
 + pretty: add %D format specifier

 The pretty-format specifier "%d", which expanded to " (tagname)"
 for a tagged commit, gained a cousin "%D" that just gives the
 "tagname" without frills.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/ignore-sigpipe-while-running-hooks (2014-09-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-19 at 7abf293)

 pre- and post-receive hooks are no longer required to read all
 their inputs.

 Will merge to 'master'.

  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-23 at 506b89b)
 + mailinfo: work around -Wstring-plus-int warning
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-19 at 314af77)
 + mailinfo: make ">From" in-body header check more robust

 Some MUAs mangled a line in a message that begins with "From " to
 ">From " when writing to a mailbox file and feeding such an input
 to "git am" used to lose such a line.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/prune-packed-server-info (2014-09-15) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-19 at 5e6c398)
 + repack: call prune_packed_objects() and update_server_info() directly
 + server-info: clean up after writing info/packs
 + make update-server-info more robust
 + prune-packed: fix minor memory leak

 Code cleanup.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* pr/use-default-sigpipe-setting (2014-09-22) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-24 at 2d678ed)
 + mingw.h: add dummy functions for sigset_t operations
 + unblock and unignore SIGPIPE

 We used to get confused when a process called us with SIGPIPE
 ignored; we do want to die with SIGPIPE when the output is not
 read by default, and do ignore the signal when appropriate.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* rs/realloc-array (2014-09-18) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-23 at a5bb3a6)
 + use REALLOC_ARRAY for changing the allocation size of arrays
 + add macro REALLOC_ARRAY

 Code cleanup.

 Will merge to 'master'.

  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-23 at d940d15)
 + branch: clean up commit flags after merge-filter walk

 The "--verbose" option no longer breaks "git branch --merged $it".

 Will merge to 'master'.


* sb/help-unknown-command-sort-fix (2014-09-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-23 at 6ab29ed)
 + help: fix the size passed to qsort

 Code cleanup.

 Will merge to 'master'.

  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-19 at ea6ac62)
 + hash-object: add --literally option
 + hash-object: pass 'write_object' as a flag
 + hash-object: reduce file-scope statics
 (this branch is used by jc/hash-object-fsck-tag.)

 "hash-object" learned a new "--literally" option to hash any random
 garbage into a loose object, to allow us to create a test data for
 mechanisms to catch corrupt objects.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/hash-object-fsck-tag (2014-09-12) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-19 at f14a7fe)
 + t1450: make sure fsck detects a malformed tagger line
 + Merge branch 'js/fsck-tag-validation' into HEAD
 (this branch uses jc/hash-object and js/fsck-tag-validation.)

 Using "hash-object --literally", test one of the new breakages
 js/fsck-tag-validation topic teaches "fsck" to catch is caught.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* js/fsck-tag-validation (2014-09-12) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-09-19 at 4a62182)
 + Make sure that index-pack --strict checks tag objects
 + Add regression tests for stricter tag fsck'ing
 + fsck: check tag objects' headers
 + Make sure fsck_commit_buffer() does not run out of the buffer
 + fsck_object(): allow passing object data separately from the object itself
 + Refactor type_from_string() to allow continuing after detecting an error
 (this branch is used by jc/hash-object-fsck-tag.)

 Teach "git fsck" to inspect the contents of annotated tag objects.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 audited, using the GPG signature of the person who pushed, that the
 tips of branches at a public repository really point the commits
 the pusher wanted to, without having to "trust" the server.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/test-lazy-prereq (2014-06-13) 1 commit
 - tests: drop GIT_*_TIMING_TESTS environment variable support

 Test-script clean-up.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* mt/patch-id-stable (2014-06-10) 1 commit
 - patch-id: change default to stable

 Teaches "git patch-id" to compute the patch ID that does not change
 when the files in a single patch is reordered. As this new algorithm
 is backward incompatible, the last bit to flip it to be the default
 is left out of 'master' for now.

 Nobody seems to be jumping up & down requesting this last step,
 which makes the result somewhat backward incompatible.
 Will perhaps drop.
