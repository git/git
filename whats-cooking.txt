What's cooking in git.git (Dec 2011, #06; Sun, 18)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with '+' are in
'next'.

A handful of topics have graduated to 'master', but they are all minor.
More important features for 1.7.9 will come in the next batch (marked as
'Will merge to "master"' below), which should happen in a couple of days;
Peff's credential series is among them.

Here are the repositories that have my integration branches:

With maint, master, next, pu, todo:

        git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git
        git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git
        https://code.google.com/p/git-core/
        https://github.com/git/git

With only maint and master:

        git://git.sourceforge.jp/gitroot/git-core/git.git
        git://git-core.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/git-core/git-core

With all the topics and integration branches:

        https://github.com/gitster/git

The preformatted documentation in HTML and man format are found in:

        git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-{htmldocs,manpages}.git/
        git://repo.or.cz/git-{htmldocs,manpages}.git/

[Graduated to "master"]

* aw/rebase-i-stop-on-failure-to-amend (2011-11-30) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-12-09 at a117e83)
 + rebase -i: interrupt rebase when "commit --amend" failed during "reword"

* jc/commit-amend-no-edit (2011-12-08) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-12-09 at b9cfa4e)
 + test: commit --amend should honor --no-edit
 + commit: honour --no-edit
 + t7501 (commit): modernize style
 + test: remove a porcelain test that hard-codes commit names
 + test: add missing "&&" after echo command

* jc/stream-to-pack (2011-12-01) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-12-09 at d0fd605)
 + bulk-checkin: replace fast-import based implementation
 + csum-file: introduce sha1file_checkpoint
 + finish_tmp_packfile(): a helper function
 + create_tmp_packfile(): a helper function
 + write_pack_header(): a helper function
 (this branch is used by jc/split-blob.)

Teaches "git add" to send large-ish blob data straight to a packfile.
This is a continuation to the "large file support" topic. The codepath to
move data from worktree to repository is made aware of streaming, just
like the checkout codepath that goes the other way, which was done in the
previous "large file support" topic in the 1.7.7 cycle.

* jh/fast-import-notes (2011-11-28) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-12-09 at 2b01132)
 + fast-import: Fix incorrect fanout level when modifying existing notes refs
 + t9301: Add 2nd testcase exposing bugs in fast-import's notes fanout handling
 + t9301: Fix testcase covering up a bug in fast-import's notes fanout handling

* jk/upload-archive-use-start-command (2011-11-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-12-09 at 88cb83a)
 + upload-archive: use start_command instead of fork

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* cn/maint-lf-to-crlf-filter (2011-12-16) 1 commit
 - lf_to_crlf_filter(): tell the caller we added "\n" when draining
 (this branch is used by jc/maint-lf-to-crlf-keep-crlf.)

A recent fix to the codepath was not quite correct.

Will merge to "next".

* jc/maint-lf-to-crlf-keep-crlf (2011-12-18) 1 commit
 - lf_to_crlf_filter(): resurrect CRLF->CRLF hack
 (this branch uses cn/maint-lf-to-crlf-filter.)

The lf-to-crlf filter in the streaming checkout codepath forgot that we
try not to convert LF to CRLF if the repository data already has CRLF.

Will merge to "next".

* jc/request-pull-show-head-4 (2011-12-16) 1 commit

A counter-proposal to jc/push-ignore-stale that may encourage a bad
workflow.

 - test: errors preparing for a test are not special

Will merge to "next".

 - read_packed_refs(): take (ref_entry *) instead of (ref_dir *)
 - find_ref(): take (ref_entry *) instead of (ref_dir *)

 + docs: mention "-k" for both forms of "git mv"

Will merge to "master".

  (merged to 'next' on 2011-12-13 at d37a7e1)

The test breakage that originally triggered interest in this topic is
fixed more cleanly with Peff's jk/maint-do-not-feed-stdin-to-tests but
this series may independently be useful.

Jonathan had good review comments, and this would need to be rerolled.

* jc/push-ignore-stale (2011-12-14) 2 commits
 - push: --ignore-stale option
 - set_ref_status_for_push(): use transport-flags abstraction

Probably solving a wrong problem and encouraging a wrong workflow while at
it. Will drop. jc/advise-push-default might be a better approach.

  (merged to 'next' on 2011-12-13 at 805c018)

 - revert: make commit subjects in insn sheet optional
 - revert: free msg in format_todo()
 (this branch uses jn/maint-sequencer-fixes.)

Picked up only the earlier bits that are reasonably clear for now.

Will merge to "next".

* ew/keepalive (2011-12-05) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-12-13 at 1b5d5c4)
 + enable SO_KEEPALIVE for connected TCP sockets

Will merge to "master".

 + t3401: use test_commit in setup
 + t3401: modernize style
 + t3040 (subprojects-basic): fix '&&' chaining, modernize style
 + t1510 (worktree): fix '&&' chaining
 + t3030 (merge-recursive): use test_expect_code
 + test: fix '&&' chaining
 + t3200 (branch): fix '&&' chaining

Will merge to "master".

* jc/split-blob (2011-12-01) 6 commits
 . WIP (streaming chunked)
 - chunked-object: fallback checkout codepaths
 - bulk-checkin: support chunked-object encoding
 - bulk-checkin: allow the same data to be multiply hashed
 - new representation types in the packstream
 - varint-in-pack: refactor varint encoding/decoding

Not ready. At least pack-objects and fsck need to learn the new encoding
for the series to be usable locally, and then index-pack/unpack-objects
needs to learn it to be used remotely.

* jk/credentials (2011-12-12) 14 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-12-12 at 7a6d658)
 + t: add test harness for external credential helpers

 + Makefile: unix sockets may not available on some platforms
 + credentials: add "cache" helper
 + docs: end-user documentation for the credential subsystem
 + credential: make relevance of http path configurable
 + credential: add credential.*.username
 + credential: apply helper config
 + http: use credential API to get passwords
 + credential: add function for parsing url components
 + introduce credentials API
 + t5550: fix typo
 + test-lib: add test_config_global variant
 (this branch is used by jk/git-prompt.)

Later part split out to expedite moving the earlier good bits forward.

Will merge to "master".

* ab/enable-i18n (2011-12-05) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-12-13 at 65af8cd)

 - pretty: %G[?GS] placeholders
 - test "commit -S" and "log --show-signature"
 - log: --show-signature
 - commit: teach --gpg-sign option

Not exactly urgent.
