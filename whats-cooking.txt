What's cooking in git.git (Apr 2016, #03; Thu, 7)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

The 'master' branch now has the second batch of topics of this
cycle.

There are a handful of topics that are stuck; they are marked as
"Needs review", "Needs an Ack", etc. in the following list.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

[Graduated to "master"]

* cc/doc-recommend-performance-trace-to-file (2016-03-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-04-04 at 26f94c0)
 + Documentation: talk about pager in api-trace.txt

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2016-03-23

 A minor documentation update.


* da/mergetool-delete-delete-conflict (2016-03-10) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-04-04 at 34e645f)
 + mergetool: honor tempfile configuration when resolving delete conflicts
 + mergetool: support delete/delete conflicts

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2016-03-15

 "git mergetool" did not work well with conflicts that both sides
 deleted.


* jk/credential-cache-comment-exit (2016-03-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-04-04 at 50427fe)
 + credential-cache--daemon: clarify "exit" action semantics

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2016-03-23

 A code clarification.


* jk/send-email-rtrim-mailrc-alias (2016-03-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-04-04 at 4d54956)
 + send-email: ignore trailing whitespace in mailrc alias file

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2016-03-23

 "git send-email" had trouble parsing alias file in mailrc format
 when lines in it had trailing whitespaces on them.


* jk/submodule-c-credential (2016-03-23) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-04-04 at 8de8e8c)
 + git_config_push_parameter: handle empty GIT_CONFIG_PARAMETERS
 + git: submodule honor -c credential.* from command line
 + quote: implement sq_quotef()
 + submodule: fix segmentation fault in submodule--helper clone
 + submodule: fix submodule--helper clone usage
 + submodule: check argc count for git submodule--helper clone
 + submodule: don't pass empty string arguments to submodule--helper clone

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2016-03-23

 "git -c credential.<var>=<value> submodule" can now be used to
 propagate configuration variables related to credential helper
 down to the submodules.


* jk/test-httpd-config-nosystem (2016-03-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-04-04 at 5fa6274)
 + t/lib-httpd: pass through GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM env

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2016-03-23

 The tests that involve running httpd leaked the system-wide
 configuration in /etc/gitconfig to the tested environment.


* jv/merge-nothing-into-void (2016-03-23) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-04-04 at aa37405)
 + merge: fix NULL pointer dereference when merging nothing into void

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2016-03-23

 "git merge FETCH_HEAD" dereferenced NULL pointer when merging
 nothing into an unborn history (which is arguably unusual usage,
 which perhaps was the reason why nobody noticed it).


* la/tag-force-signing-annotated-tags (2016-03-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-04-04 at a49ec4a)
 + tag: add the option to force signing of annotated tags

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2016-03-24

 "git tag" can create an annotated tag without explicitly given an
 "-a" (or "-s") option (i.e. when a tag message is given).  A new
 configuration variable, tag.forceSignAnnotated, can be used to tell
 the command to create signed tag in such a situation.


* ls/p4-map-user (2016-03-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-04-04 at a56b011)
 + git-p4: map a P4 user to Git author name and email address

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2016-03-23

 "git p4" now allows P4 author names to be mapped to Git author
 names.


* pb/t7502-drop-dup (2016-03-11) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-04-04 at 4799cad)
 + t/t7502 : drop duplicate test
 (this branch is used by pb/commit-verbose-config.)

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2016-03-15

 Code clean-up.


* sb/clone-t57-t56 (2016-03-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-04-04 at 5c20247)
 + clone tests: rename t57* => t56*

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2016-03-23

 Rename bunch of tests on "git clone" for better organization.


* sb/rebase-x (2016-03-18) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-04-04 at feda620)
 + t3404: cleanup double empty lines between tests
 + rebase: decouple --exec from --interactive

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2016-03-23

 "git rebase -x" can be used without passing "-i" option.


* sb/submodule-parallel-update (2016-03-01) 10 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-04-04 at a0aea8d)
 + clone: allow an explicit argument for parallel submodule clones
 + submodule update: expose parallelism to the user
 + submodule helper: remove double 'fatal: ' prefix
 + git submodule update: have a dedicated helper for cloning
 + run_processes_parallel: rename parameters for the callbacks
 + run_processes_parallel: treat output of children as byte array
 + submodule update: direct error message to stderr
 + fetching submodules: respect `submodule.fetchJobs` config option
 + submodule-config: drop check against NULL
 + submodule-config: keep update strategy around
 (this branch is used by sb/clone-shallow-passthru and sb/submodule-init.)

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2016-03-15

 A major part of "git submodule update" has been ported to C to take
 advantage of the recently added framework to run download tasks in
 parallel.


* ss/commit-squash-msg (2016-03-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-04-04 at d389f19)
 + commit: do not lose SQUASH_MSG contents

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2016-03-23

 When "git merge --squash" stopped due to conflict, the concluding
 "git commit" failed to read in the SQUASH_MSG that shows the log
 messages from all the squashed commits.


* ss/exc-flag-is-a-collection-of-bits (2016-03-01) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-04-04 at 9f0207e)
 + dir: store EXC_FLAG_* values in unsigned integers

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2016-03-04

 Code clean-up.


* ss/receive-pack-parse-options (2016-03-01) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-04-04 at fd6ab4c)
 + builtin/receive-pack.c: use parse_options API

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2016-03-04

 The command line argument parser for "receive-pack" has been
 rewritten to use parse-options.

[New Topics]

* jc/drop-git-spec-in (2016-04-06) 1 commit
 - Makefile: stop pretending to support rpmbuild

 As nobody maintains our in-tree git.spec.in and distros use their
 own spec file, we stopped pretending that we support "make rpm".


* jc/makefile-redirection-stderr (2016-04-05) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-04-06 at e3f2ded)
 + Makefile: fix misdirected redirections

 A minor fix in the Makefile.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* js/mingw-tests-2.8 (2016-04-04) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-04-06 at f85a013)
 + Windows: shorten code by re-using convert_slashes()

 Code clean-up.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ar/diff-args-osx-precompose (2016-04-05) 1 commit
 - diff: run arguments through precompose_argv

 Many commands normalize command line arguments from NFD to NFC
 variant of UTF-8 on OSX, but commands in the "diff" family did
 not, causing "git diff $path" to complain that no such path is
 known to Git.  They have been taught to do the normalization.

 Will be rerolled?
 ($gmane/290724)


* ep/trace-doc-sample-fix (2016-04-05) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-04-06 at 0df7357)
 + api-trace.txt: fix typo

 Fix a typo in an example in the trace API documentation.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ew/send-email-readable-message-id (2016-04-06) 1 commit
 - send-email: more meaningful Message-ID

 "git send-email" now uses a more readable timestamps when
 formulating a message ID.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* mg/complete-cherry-mark-to-log (2016-04-05) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-04-06 at 3002be6)
 + completion: complete --cherry-mark for git log

 The completion scripts (in contrib/) did not include the
 "--cherry-mark" option when completing "git log <HT>".

 Will merge to 'master'.


* tb/blame-force-read-cache-to-workaround-safe-crlf (2016-04-05) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-04-06 at 263bba8)
 + correct blame for files commited with CRLF

 When running "git blame $path" with unnormalized data in the index
 for the path, the data in the working tree was blamed, even though
 "git add" would not have changed what is already in the index, due
 to "safe crlf" that disables the line-end conversion.  It has been
 corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* st/verify-tag (2016-04-06) 3 commits
 - verify-tag: change variable name for readability
 - t7030: test verifying multiple tags
 - builtin/verify-tag.c: ignore SIGPIPE in gpg-interface

 Only the first three patches in a six-patch series.


* ew/send-email-drop-data-dumper (2016-04-06) 1 commit
 - send-email: do not load Data::Dumper

 Code clean-up.

 Will merge to 'next'.

[Stalled]

* da/user-useconfigonly (2016-04-01) 2 commits
 - ident: give "please tell me" message upon useConfigOnly error
 - ident: check for useConfigOnly before auto-detection of name/email

 The "user.useConfigOnly" configuration variable makes it an error
 if users do not explicitly set user.name and user.email.  However,
 its check was not done early enough and allowed another error to
 trigger, reporting that the default value we guessed from the
 system setting was unusable.  This was a suboptimal end-user
 experience as we want the users to set user.name/user.email without
 relying on the auto-detection at all.

 Waiting for Acks.
 ($gmane/290340)


* sb/clone-shallow-passthru (2016-03-23) 3 commits
 - clone: add t5614 to test cloning submodules with shallowness involved
 - submodule clone: pass along `local` option
 - clone: add `--shallow-submodules` flag

 "git clone" learned "--shallow-submodules" option.

 Needs review.


* sg/completion-updates (2016-02-28) 21 commits
 - completion: cache the path to the repository
 - completion: extract repository discovery from __gitdir()
 - completion: don't guard git executions with __gitdir()
 - completion: consolidate silencing errors from git commands
 - completion: don't use __gitdir() for git commands

 - rev-parse: add '--absolute-git-dir' option
 - completion: list short refs from a remote given as a URL
 - completion: don't list 'HEAD' when trying refs completion outside of a repo
 - completion: list refs from remote when remote's name matches a directory
 - completion: respect 'git --git-dir=<path>' when listing remote refs
 - completion: fix most spots not respecting 'git --git-dir=<path>'
 - completion: ensure that the repository path given on the command line exists
 - completion tests: add tests for the __git_refs() helper function
 - completion tests: check __gitdir()'s output in the error cases
 - completion tests: consolidate getting path of current working directory
 - completion tests: make the $cur variable local to the test helper functions
 - completion tests: don't add test cruft to the test repository
 - completion: improve __git_refs()'s in-code documentation

 Will be rerolled.

* nd/shallow-deepen (2016-02-23) 25 commits
 - fetch, upload-pack: --deepen=N extends shallow boundary by N commits
 - upload-pack: add get_reachable_list()
 - upload-pack: split check_unreachable() in two, prep for get_reachable_list()
 - t5500, t5539: tests for shallow depth excluding a ref
 - clone: define shallow clone boundary with --shallow-exclude
 - fetch: define shallow boundary with --shallow-exclude
 - upload-pack: support define shallow boundary by excluding revisions
 - refs: add expand_ref()
 - t5500, t5539: tests for shallow depth since a specific date
 - clone: define shallow clone boundary based on time with --shallow-since
 - fetch: define shallow boundary with --shallow-since
 - upload-pack: add deepen-since to cut shallow repos based on time
 - shallow.c: implement a generic shallow boundary finder based on rev-list
 - fetch-pack: use a separate flag for fetch in deepening mode
 - fetch-pack: use a common function for verbose printing
 - fetch-pack: use skip_prefix() instead of starts_with()
 - upload-pack: move rev-list code out of check_non_tip()
 - upload-pack: tighten number parsing at "deepen" lines
 - upload-pack: use skip_prefix() instead of starts_with()
 - upload-pack: move "unshallow" sending code out of deepen()
 - upload-pack: remove unused variable "backup"
 - upload-pack: move "shallow" sending code out of deepen()
 - upload-pack: move shallow deepen code out of receive_needs()
 - transport-helper.c: refactor set_helper_option()
 - remote-curl.c: convert fetch_git() to use argv_array

 The existing "git fetch --depth=<n>" option was hard to use
 correctly when making the history of an existing shallow clone
 deeper.  A new option, "--deepen=<n>", has been added to make this
 easier to use.  "git clone" also learned "--shallow-since=<date>"
 and "--shallow-exclude=<tag>" options to make it easier to specify
 "I am interested only in the recent N months worth of history" and
 "Give me only the history since that version".

 Needs review.


* sb/submodule-init (2016-03-15) 2 commits
 . submodule: port init from shell to C
 . submodule: port resolve_relative_url from shell to C

 Update of "git submodule" to move pieces of logic to C continues.

 Needs review.
 ($gmane/288824)


* az/p4-bare-no-rebase (2016-02-19) 1 commit
 - git-p4.py: Don't try to rebase on submit from bare repository

 "git p4 submit" attempts to do a rebase, which would fail if done
 in a bare repository.  Not doing this rebase would paper over the
 failure, which is what this patch does, but it is unclear what the
 side effect of not rebasing is.

 Needs a better explanation.


* ss/commit-dry-run-resolve-merge-to-no-op (2016-02-17) 1 commit
 - wt-status.c: set commitable bit if there is a meaningful merge.

 "git commit --dry-run" reported "No, no, you cannot commit." in one
 case where "git commit" would have allowed you to commit, and this
 improves it a little bit ("git commit --dry-run --short" still does
 not give you the correct answer, for example).


* nd/icase (2016-02-15) 12 commits
 - grep.c: reuse "icase" variable
 - diffcore-pickaxe: support case insensitive match on non-ascii
 - diffcore-pickaxe: "share" regex error handling code
 - grep/pcre: support utf-8
 - gettext: add is_utf8_locale()
 - grep/pcre: prepare locale-dependent tables for icase matching
 - grep/icase: avoid kwsset when -F is specified
 - grep/icase: avoid kwsset on literal non-ascii strings
 - test-regex: expose full regcomp() to the command line
 - test-regex: isolate the bug test code
 - grep: break down an "if" stmt in preparation for next changes
 - grep: allow -F -i combination

 "git grep -i" has been taught to fold case in non-ascii locales.

 Needs review.

* js/am-3-merge-recursive-direct (2015-10-12) 2 commits
 - am: make a direct call to merge_recursive
 - merge_recursive_options: introduce the "gently" flag

 The merge_recursive_generic() function has been made a bit safer to
 call from inside a process.  "git am -3" was taught to make a direct
 call to the function when falling back to three-way merge.

 Being able to make a direct call would be good in general, but as a
 performance thing, the change needs to be backed up by numbers.

 Needs review.

 I haven't gone through the "gently" change with fine toothed comb;
 I can see that the change avoids calling die(), but I haven't made
 sure that the program states (e.g. what's in the in-core index) are
 adjusted sensibly when it returns to the caller instead of dying,
 or the codepaths that used to die() are free of resource leaks.
 The original code certainly did not care the program states at the
 point of dying exactly because it knew it is going to exit, but now
 they have to care, and they need to be audited.

 . WIPWIP
 . WIP: diff-b-m
 - diffcore-rename: allow easier debugging
 - diffcore-rename.c: add locate_rename_src()
 - diffcore-break: allow debugging

 "git diff -B -M" produced incorrect patch when the postimage of a
 completely rewritten file is similar to the preimage of a removed
 file; such a resulting file must not be expressed as a rename from
 other place.

 The fix in this patch is broken, unfortunately.
 Will discard.

* es/format-patch-doc-hide-no-patch (2016-04-04) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-04-06 at 25d79bb)
 + git-format-patch.txt: don't show -s as shorthand for multiple options

 "git format-patch --help" showed `-s` and `--no-patch` as if these
 are valid options to the command.  We already hide `--patch` option
 from the documentation, because format-patch is about showing the
 diff, and the documentation now hides these options as well.

* jk/branch-shortening-funny-symrefs (2016-04-04) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-04-06 at 1a3f8be)
 + branch: fix shortening of non-remote symrefs

 A change back in version 2.7 to "git branch" broke display of a
 symbolic ref in a non-standard place in the refs/ hierarchy (we
 expect symbolic refs to appear in refs/remotes/*/HEAD to point at
 the primary branch the remote has, and as .git/HEAD to point at the
 branch we locally checked out).

 Will merge to 'next' and later down to maint-2.7.


* jn/mergetools-examdiff (2016-04-04) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-04-06 at 819e858)

 . ref-filter: add support for %(refname:dir) and %(refname:base)
 . ref-filter: introduce refname_atom_parser()
 . ref-filter: introduce symref_atom_parser()
 . ref-filter: make "%(symref)" atom work with the ':short' modifier
 . ref-filter: add support for %(upstream:track,nobracket)
 . ref-filter: make %(upstream:track) prints "[gone]" for invalid upstreams
 . ref-filter: introduce format_ref_array_item()
 . ref-filter: move get_head_description() from branch.c
 . ref-filter: modify "%(objectname:short)" to take length
 . ref-filter: implement %(if:equals=<string>) and %(if:notequals=<string>)
 . ref-filter: include reference to 'used_atom' within 'atom_value'
 . ref-filter: implement %(if), %(then), and %(else) atoms

 The code to list branches in "git branch" has been consolidated
 with the more generic ref-filter API.

 Will be rerolled.

* sb/submodule-helper-clone-regression-fix (2016-04-01) 6 commits
 - submodule--helper, module_clone: catch fprintf failure
 - submodule--helper: do not borrow absolute_path() result for too long
 - submodule--helper, module_clone: always operate on absolute paths
 - submodule--helper clone: create the submodule path just once
 - submodule--helper: fix potential NULL-dereference
 - recursive submodules: test for relative paths

 A partial rewrite of "git submodule" in the 2.7 timeframe changed
 the way the gitdir: pointer in the submodules point at the real
 repository location to use absolute paths by accident.  This has
 been corrected.

 Any further comments?  Otherwise will merge to 'next'.

 "git submodule" reports the paths of submodules the command
 recurses into, but this was incorrect when the command was not run
 from the root level of the superproject.

 Any further comments?  Otherwise will merge to 'next'.

 + diffcore: fix iteration order of identical files during rename detection

 "git diff -M" used to work better when two originally identical
 files A and B got renamed to X/A and X/B by pairing A to X/A and B
 to X/B, but this was broken in the 2.0 timeframe.

* xy/format-patch-base (2016-03-31) 4 commits
 - format-patch: introduce format.base configuration
 - format-patch: introduce --base=auto option
 - format-patch: add '--base' option to record base tree info
 - patch-ids: make commit_patch_id() a public helper function

 "git format-patch" learned a new "--base" option to record what
 (public, well-known) commit the original series was built on in
 its output.

 Will be rerolled.

* tb/safe-crlf-output-fix (2016-04-01) 7 commits
 . convert.c: more safer crlf handling with text attribute
 . correct blame for files commited with CRLF
 . convert: unify the "auto" handling of CRLF
 . t0027: test cases for combined attributes
 . convert: allow core.autocrlf=input and core.eol=crlf
 . convert.c: stream and early out
 . read-cache: factor out get_sha1_from_index() helper

 The "safe CRLF" facility disables line-end conversion from CRLF to
 LF when checking in if the blob registered to the index already
 contains CR, but some codepaths like "git blame" did not know this,
 and instead assumed that only the configuration and attribute
 settings determined how the data from the working tree is converted.

 Will be rerolled.

 change is that there is no longer git_config_early()), so that we
 do not attempt to look into refs/* when we know we do not have a
 Git repository.

 "git pull --rebase" learned "--[no-]autostash" option, so that
 the rebase.autostash configuration variable set to true can be
 overridden from the command line.

 "git commit" learned to pay attention to "commit.verbose"
 configuration variable and act as if "--verbose" option was
 given from the command line.

* jc/merge-refuse-new-root (2016-03-23) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-04-04 at cd70fd6)
 + merge: refuse to create too cool a merge by default

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2016-03-23

 "git merge" used to allow merging two branches that have no common
 base by default, which led to a brand new history of an existing
 project created and then get pulled by an unsuspecting maintainer,
 which allowed an unnecessary parallel history merged into the
 existing project.  The command has been taught not to allow this by
 default, with an escape hatch "--allow-unrelated-histories" option
 to be used in a rare event that merges histories of two projects
 that started their lives independently.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* lt/pretty-expand-tabs (2016-04-04) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-04-06 at 186ac2a)
 + pretty: test --expand-tabs
 + pretty: allow tweaking tabwidth in --expand-tabs
 + pretty: enable --expand-tabs by default for selected pretty formats
 + pretty: expand tabs in indented logs to make things line up properly

 When "git log" shows the log message indented by 4-spaces, the
 remainder of a line after a HT does not align in the way the author
 originally intended.  The command now expands tabs by default in
 such a case, and allows the users to override it with a new option,
 '--no-expand-tabs'.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 The beginning of "split bundle", which could be one of the
 ingredients to allow "git clone" traffic off of the core server
 network to CDN.

 no way to record these separate resolutions.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jc/merge-drop-old-syntax (2015-04-29) 1 commit
 - merge: drop 'git merge <message> HEAD <commit>' syntax

 Stop supporting "git merge <message> HEAD <commit>" syntax that has
 been deprecated since October 2007, and issues a deprecation
 warning message since v2.5.0.

 It has been reported that git-gui still uses the deprecated syntax,
 which needs to be fixed before this final step can proceed.
