What's cooking in git.git (Sep 2011, #01; Fri, 2)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.

Some of the recent patches are fixes to new feature topics already merged
to "master" and are being fast tracked for 1.7.7-rc1, but otherwise
patches for new features and fixes to longstanding issues will stay in
'pu' or 'next' until the 1.7.7 final.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* mh/check-ref-format-print-normalize (2011-08-27) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-08-30 at e827410)
 + Forbid DEL characters in reference names
 + check-ref-format --print: Normalize refnames that start with slashes

Will merge to "master".

* bk/ancestry-path (2011-08-25) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-09-02 at d05ba5d)
 + revision: do not include sibling history in --ancestry-path output
 + revision: keep track of the end-user input from the command line
 + rev-list: Demonstrate breakage with --ancestry-path --all

The topic came up a bit too late in the cycle.
Will cook for a while.

  (merged to 'next' on 2011-09-02 at b818eae)
 + branch: allow pattern arguments
 + branch: introduce --list option
 + git-branch: introduce missing long forms for the options
 + git-tag: introduce long forms for the options
 + t6040: test branch -vv

Not urgent; the topic came up a bit too late in the cycle.

* mm/rebase-i-exec-edit (2011-08-26) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-09-02 at e75b1b9)
 + rebase -i: notice and warn if "exec $cmd" modifies the index or the working tree

Not urgent; the topic came up a bit too late in the cycle.

* jk/default-attr (2011-08-26) 1 commit
 - attr: map builtin userdiff drivers to well-known extensions

Not urgent; I fixed up the test breakage just for fun.

 - submodule: Search for merges only at end of recursive merge
 - allow multiple calls to submodule merge search for the same path

The bottom one needs to be replaced with a properly written commit log message.

* mm/mediawiki-as-a-remote (2011-09-01) 2 commits
 - git-remote-mediawiki: allow push to set MediaWiki metadata
 - Add a remote helper to interact with mediawiki (fetch & push)

Fun.
Not urgent; the topic came up a bit too late in the cycle.

* nd/maint-autofix-tag-in-head (2011-08-26) 3 commits
 - Accept tags in HEAD or MERGE_HEAD
 - merge: remove global variable head[]
 - merge: keep stash[] a local variable

Probably needs a re-roll to aim a bit higher.
Not urgent; will not be in 1.7.7.

* bc/unstash-clean-crufts (2011-08-27) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-09-02 at 7bfd66f)

* gb/am-hg-patch (2011-08-29) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-09-02 at 3edfe4c)
 + am: preliminary support for hg patches

Not urgent; the topic came up a bit too late in the cycle.

  (merged to 'next' on 2011-08-24 at 398e764)
 + push: teach --recurse-submodules the on-demand option
 (this branch is used by hv/submodule-merge-search.)

What the topic aims to achieve may make sense, but the implementation
looked somewhat suboptimal.

* jc/fetch-verify (2011-09-01) 4 commits
 - NEEDSWORK: rev-list --verify-objects: run fsck_objects() on all objects listed
 - fetch: verify we have everything we need before updating our ref

Make "git fetch" verify what it received a bit more carefully before
updating the refs in the receiving end.

Not urgent; the topic came up a bit too late in the cycle.

  (merged to 'next' on 2011-09-02 at be4d245)

I've taken advantage of the end-of-summer lull and reproduced all 16000+
two-head merges in the Linux kernel repository with and without this
series to make sure they get the identical results (either cleanly merged,
or getting conflicted the same way).

[Stalled]

* jk/add-i-hunk-filter (2011-07-27) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-08-11 at 8ff9a56)
 + add--interactive: add option to autosplit hunks
 + add--interactive: allow negatation of hunk filters
 + add--interactive: allow hunk filtering on command line
 + add--interactive: factor out regex error handling
 + add--interactive: refactor patch mode argument processing

Needs documentation updates, tests, and integration with the higher level
callers, e.g. "git add -p".

* jh/receive-count-limit (2011-05-23) 10 commits
 - receive-pack: Allow server to refuse pushes with too many objects
 - pack-objects: Estimate pack size; abort early if pack size limit is exceeded
 - send-pack/receive-pack: Allow server to refuse pushing too large packs
 - pack-objects: Allow --max-pack-size to be used together with --stdout
 - send-pack/receive-pack: Allow server to refuse pushes with too many commits
 - pack-objects: Teach new option --max-commit-count, limiting #commits in pack
 - receive-pack: Prepare for addition of the new 'limit-*' family of capabilities
 - Tighten rules for matching server capabilities in server_supports()
 - send-pack: Attempt to retrieve remote status even if pack-objects fails
 - Update technical docs to reflect side-band-64k capability in receive-pack

Would need another round to separate per-pack and per-session limits.

* jm/mergetool-pathspec (2011-06-22) 2 commits

The initial "tag --contains" de-pessimization without need for generation
numbers is already in; backburnered.

 - On Cygwin support both UNIX and DOS style path-names
 - git-compat-util: add generic find_last_dir_sep that respects is_dir_sep

I think a further refactoring (no, not my suggestion) was offered?

* jc/traverse-commit-list (2011-08-22) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-08-24 at df50dd7)
 + revision.c: update show_object_with_name() without using malloc()
 + revision.c: add show_object_with_name() helper function
 + rev-list: fix finish_object() call
 (this branch is used by jc/fetch-verify.)

Not urgent; will not be in 1.7.7.

* fk/make-auto-header-dependencies (2011-08-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-08-24 at 3da2c25)
 + Makefile: Use computed header dependencies if the compiler supports it
 (this branch is used by da/make-auto-header-dependencies.)

Not urgent; will not be in 1.7.7.

* mh/iterate-refs (2011-08-14) 6 commits
 - Retain caches of submodule refs
 - Store the submodule name in struct cached_refs
 - Allocate cached_refs objects dynamically
 - Change the signature of read_packed_refs()
 - Access reference caches only through new function get_cached_refs()
 - Extract a function clear_cached_refs()

I did not see anything fundamentally wrong with this series, but it was
unclear what the benefit of these changes are.  If the series were to read
parts of the ref hierarchy (like refs/heads/) lazily, the story would
have been different, though.

Not urgent; will not be in 1.7.7.

* hv/submodule-update-none (2011-08-11) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-08-24 at 5302fc1)
 + add update 'none' flag to disable update of submodule by default
 + submodule: move update configuration variable further up

Not urgent; will not be in 1.7.7.

* jc/lookup-object-hash (2011-08-11) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-08-24 at 5825411)
 + object hash: replace linear probing with 4-way cuckoo hashing
 + object hash: we know the table size is a power of two
 + object hash: next_size() helper for readability
 + pack-objects --count-only
 + object.c: remove duplicated code for object hashing
 + object.c: code movement for readability

I do not think there is anything fundamentally wrong with this series, but
the risk of breakage far outweighs observed performance gain in one
particular workload. Will keep it in 'next' at least for one cycle.

Not urgent; will not be in 1.7.7.

* fg/submodule-git-file-git-dir (2011-08-22) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-08-23 at 762194e)
 + Move git-dir for submodules
 + rev-parse: add option --resolve-git-dir <path>

I do not think there is anything fundamentally wrong with this series, but
the risk of breakage outweighs any benefit for having this new
feature. Will keep it in 'next' at least for one cycle.

Not urgent; will not be in 1.7.7.

* jk/http-auth-keyring (2011-08-03) 13 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-08-03 at b06e80e)
 + credentials: add "getpass" helper
 + credentials: add "store" helper
 + credentials: add "cache" helper
 + docs: end-user documentation for the credential subsystem
 + http: use hostname in credential description
 + allow the user to configure credential helpers
 + look for credentials in config before prompting
 + http: use credential API to get passwords
 + introduce credentials API
 + http: retry authentication failures for all http requests
 + remote-curl: don't retry auth failures with dumb protocol
 + improve httpd auth tests
 + url: decode buffers that are not NUL-terminated

Looked mostly reasonable except for the limitation that it is not clear
how to deal with a site at which a user needs to use different passwords 
for different repositories. Will keep it in "next" at least for one cycle,
until we start hearing real-world success reports on the list.

Not urgent; will not be in 1.7.7.

 + revert: Don't implicitly stomp pending sequencer operation
 + revert: Remove sequencer state when no commits are pending
 + reset: Make reset remove the sequencer state
 + revert: Introduce --reset to remove sequencer state
 + revert: Make pick_commits functionally act on a commit list
 + revert: Save command-line options for continuing operation
 + revert: Save data for continuing after conflict resolution
 + revert: Don't create invalid replay_opts in parse_args
 + revert: Separate cmdline parsing from functional code

 + revert: Don't check lone argument in get_encoding
 + revert: Simplify and inline add_message_to_msg
 + config: Introduce functions to write non-standard file
 + advice: Introduce error_resolve_conflict

Will keep it in 'next' at least for one cycle.
