What's cooking in git.git (Sep 2013, #02; Mon, 9)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.

The second batch of topics are now in 'master'.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-08-06

 More fixes to the code to parse the "-L" option in "log" and "blame".


* es/blame-L-twice (2013-08-06) 16 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-08-28 at e83ae2e)
 + line-range: reject -L line numbers less than 1

 (this branch is used by es/contacts-blame-L-multi; uses es/blame-L-more.)

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-08-08

 Teaches "git blame" to take more than one -L ranges.

  (merged to 'next' on 2013-08-28 at 3ad1f21)

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-08-14


* jc/check-x-z (2013-07-11) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-08-28 at a7670ce)
 + check-attr -z: a single -z should apply to both input and output
 + check-ignore -z: a single -z should apply to both input and output
 + check-attr: the name of the character is NUL, not NULL
 + check-ignore: the name of the character is NUL, not NULL

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-07-15

 "git check-ignore -z" applied the NUL termination to both its input
 (with --stdin) and its output, but "git check-attr -z" ignored the
 option on the output side.

 This is potentially a backward incompatible fix.  Let's see if
 anybody screams before deciding if we want to do anything to help
 existing users (there may be none).


* jc/diff-filter-negation (2013-07-19) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-08-28 at 5cc7720)
 + diff: deprecate -q option to diff-files
 + diff: allow lowercase letter to specify what change class to exclude
 + diff: reject unknown change class given to --diff-filter
 + diff: preparse --diff-filter string argument
 + diff: factor out match_filter()
 + diff: pass the whole diff_options to diffcore_apply_filter()
 (this branch is used by jc/hold-diff-remove-q-synonym-for-no-deletion.)

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-07-22

 Teach "git diff --diff-filter" to express "I do not want to see
 these classes of changes" more directly by listing only the
 unwanted ones in lowercase (e.g. "--diff-filter=d" will show
 everything but deletion) and deprecate "diff-files -q" which did
 the same thing as "--diff-filter=d".


* jc/parseopt-command-modes (2013-07-30) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-08-28 at 738b399)
 + tag: use OPT_CMDMODE
 + parse-options: add OPT_CMDMODE()
 (this branch is used by sb/parseopt-boolean-removal.)

 Many commands use --dashed-option as a operation mode selector
 (e.g. "git tag --delete") that the user can use at most one
 (e.g. "git tag --delete --verify" is a nonsense) and you cannot
 negate (e.g. "git tag --no-delete" is a nonsense).  Make it easier
 for users of parse_options() to enforce these restrictions.


* jc/push-cas (2013-08-02) 9 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-08-28 at 784281f)
 + push: teach --force-with-lease to smart-http transport
 + send-pack: fix parsing of --force-with-lease option
 + t5540/5541: smart-http does not support "--force-with-lease"
 + t5533: test "push --force-with-lease"
 + push --force-with-lease: tie it all together
 + push --force-with-lease: implement logic to populate old_sha1_expect[]
 + remote.c: add command line option parser for "--force-with-lease"
 + builtin/push.c: use OPT_BOOL, not OPT_BOOLEAN
 + cache.h: move remote/connect API out of it

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-08-05

 Allow a safer "rewind of the remote tip" push than blind "--force",
 by requiring that the overwritten remote ref to be unchanged since
 the new history to replace it was prepared.

 The machinery is more or less ready.  The "--force" option is again
 the big red button to override any safety, thanks to J6t's sanity
 (the original round allowed --lockref to defeat --force).

 The logic to choose the default implemented here is fragile
 (e.g. "git fetch" after seeing a failure will update the
 remote-tracking branch and will make the next "push" pass,
 defeating the safety pretty easily).  It is suitable only for the
 simplest workflows, and it may hurt users more than it helps them.


* jc/transport-do-not-use-connect-twice-in-fetch (2013-08-28) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-08-29 at f88a6da)
 + builtin/fetch.c: Fix a sparse warning
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-08-28 at 2ed86df)
 + fetch: work around "transport-take-over" hack
 + fetch: refactor code that fetches leftover tags
 + fetch: refactor code that prepares a transport
 + fetch: rename file-scope global "transport" to "gtransport"
 + t5802: add test for connect helper

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-08-20

 The auto-tag-following code in "git fetch" tries to reuse the same
 transport twice when the serving end does not cooperate and does
 not give tags that point to commits that are asked for as part of
 the primary transfer.  Unfortunately, Git-aware transport helper
 interface is not designed to be used more than once, hence this
 does not work over smart-http transfer.


* jc/url-match (2013-08-09) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-08-28 at 2a9fd23)
 + builtin/config.c: compilation fix
 + config: "git config --get-urlmatch" parses section.<url>.key
 + builtin/config: refactor collect_config()
 + config: parse http.<url>.<variable> using urlmatch
 + config: add generic callback wrapper to parse section.<url>.key
 + config: add helper to normalize and match URLs
 + http.c: fix parsing of http.sslCertPasswordProtected variable

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-08-12

 Allow section.<urlpattern>.var configuration variables to be
 treated as a "virtual" section.var given a URL, and use the
 mechanism to enhance http.* configuration variables.

 This is a reroll of Kyle J. McKay's work.


* jk/cat-file-batch-optim (2013-08-05) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-08-28 at 624e60d)
 + cat-file: only split on whitespace when %(rest) is used

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-08-06

 Rework the reverted change to `cat-file --batch-check`.


* jk/fast-import-empty-ls (2013-06-23) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-08-28 at 876a39d)
 + fast-import: allow moving the root tree
 + fast-import: allow ls or filecopy of the root tree
 + fast-import: set valid mode on root tree in "ls"
 + t9300: document fast-import empty path issues

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-07-22


* jk/mailmap-incomplete-line (2013-08-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-09-04 at e77e887)
 + mailmap: handle mailmap blobs without trailing newlines

 Will merge later to 'maint'.


* jl/some-submodule-config-are-not-boolean (2013-08-19) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-08-28 at 7fabc3e)
 + avoid segfault on submodule.*.path set to an empty "true"

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-08-20


* jl/submodule-mv (2013-08-06) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-08-28 at 4ec6b41)
 + rm: delete .gitmodules entry of submodules removed from the work tree
 + mv: update the path entry in .gitmodules for moved submodules
 + submodule.c: add .gitmodules staging helper functions
 + mv: move submodules using a gitfile
 + mv: move submodules together with their work trees
 (this branch is tangled with nd/magic-pathspec.)

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-08-08

 "git mv A B" when moving a submodule A does "the right thing",
 inclusing relocating its working tree and adjusting the paths in
 the .gitmodules file.


* km/svn-1.8-serf-only (2013-07-18) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-08-28 at 1119134)
 + Git.pm: revert _temp_cache use of temp_is_locked
 + git-svn: allow git-svn fetching to work using serf
 + Git.pm: add new temp_is_locked function

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-07-19

 Subversion 1.8.0 that was recently released breaks older subversion
 clients coming over http/https in various ways.


* mm/no-shell-escape-in-die-message (2013-08-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-08-28 at 86b300f)
 + die_with_status: use "printf '%s\n'", not "echo"

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-08-08

 Fixes a minor bug in "git rebase -i" (there could be others, as the
 root cause is pretty generic) where the code feeds a random, data
 dependeant string to 'echo' and expects it to come out literally.


* ms/fetch-prune-configuration (2013-07-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-08-28 at fa6ffc7)
 + fetch: make --prune configurable

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-07-21

 Allow fetch.prune and remote.*.prune configuration variables to be set,
 and "git fetch" to behave as if "--prune" is given.

 "git fetch" that honors remote.*.prune is fine, but I wonder if we
 should somehow make "git push" aware of it as well.  Perhaps
 remote.*.prune should not be just a boolean, but a 4-way "none",
 "push", "fetch", "both"?


* nd/clone-connectivity-shortcut (2013-07-23) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-08-28 at d227f9f)
 + smart http: use the same connectivity check on cloning

* nd/gc-lock-against-each-other (2013-08-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-08-28 at 46e072b)

 + pathspec: catch prepending :(prefix) on pathspec with short magic
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-08-28 at 305c6e9)
 + rm: do not set a variable twice without intermediate reading.
 + t6131 - skip tests if on case-insensitive file system
 + parse_pathspec: accept :(icase)path syntax
 + pathspec: support :(glob) syntax
 + pathspec: make --literal-pathspecs disable pathspec magic
 + pathspec: support :(literal) syntax for noglob pathspec

 + pathspec: i18n-ize error strings in pathspec parsing code
 + move struct pathspec and related functions to pathspec.[ch]
 + clean: remove unused variable "seen"
 (this branch is tangled with jl/submodule-mv.)

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-07-23

 Use "struct pathspec" interface in more places, instead of array of
 characters, the latter of which cannot express magic pathspecs
 (e.g. ":(icase)makefile" that matches both Makefile and makefile).

  (merged to 'next' on 2013-08-28 at d0ffd55)

* sb/parseopt-boolean-removal (2013-08-07) 9 commits

 + revert: use the OPT_CMDMODE for parsing, reducing code

 + branch, commit, name-rev: ease up boolean conditions
 + checkout: remove superfluous local variable
 + log, format-patch: parsing uses OPT__QUIET
 + Replace deprecated OPT_BOOLEAN by OPT_BOOL
 + Remove deprecated OPTION_BOOLEAN for parsing arguments
 (this branch uses jc/parseopt-command-modes.)

 Convert most uses of OPT_BOOLEAN/OPTION_BOOLEAN that can use
 OPT_BOOL/OPTION_BOOLEAN which have much saner semantics, and turn
 remaining ones into OPT_SET_INT, OPT_COUNTUP, etc. as necessary.

  (merged to 'next' on 2013-08-28 at c9840d7)
 + Revert "compat/clipped-write.c: large write(2) fails on Mac OS X/XNU"
 + xread, xwrite: limit size of IO to 8MB

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-08-22

 Send a large request to read(2)/write(2) as a smaller but still
 reasonably large chunks, which would improve the latency when the
 operation needs to be killed and incidentally works around broken
 64-bit systems that cannot take a 2GB write or read in one go.


* tg/index-struct-sizes (2013-08-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-08-28 at c815042)

 Finishing touches to an earlier fix already in 'master'.


* tr/log-full-diff-keep-true-parents (2013-08-05) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-08-28 at e86ec11)
 + log: use true parents for diff when walking reflogs
 + log: use true parents for diff even when rewriting

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2013-08-08

 Output from "git log --full-diff -- <pathspec>" looked strange,
 because comparison was done with the previous ancestor that touched
 the specified <pathspec>, causing the patches for paths outside the
 pathspec to show more than the single commit has changed.

 Tweak "git reflog -p" for the same reason using the same mechanism.

[New Topics]

* js/add-i-mingw (2013-09-04) 1 commit
 - add--interactive: fix external command invocation on Windows

 The implementation of "add -i" has a crippling code to work around
 ActiveState Perl limitation but it by mistake also triggered on Git
 for Windows where MSYS perl is used.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* rh/ishes-doc (2013-09-04) 7 commits
 - glossary: fix and clarify the definition of 'ref'
 - revisions.txt: fix and clarify <rev>^{<type>}
 - glossary: more precise definition of tree-ish (a.k.a. treeish)
 - use 'commit-ish' instead of 'committish'
 - use 'tree-ish' instead of 'treeish'
 - glossary: define commit-ish (a.k.a. committish)
 - glossary: mention 'treeish' as an alternative to 'tree-ish'

 We liberally use "committish" and "commit-ish" (and "treeish" and
 "tree-ish"); as these are non-words, let's unify these terms to
 their dashed form.  More importantly, clarify the documentation on
 object peeling using these terms.

 header.

* dw/check-ignore-sans-index (2013-09-05) 2 commits
 - SQUASH??? do not let --no-index squat on short-and-sweet -i for now
 - check-ignore: Add option to ignore index contents

 "git check-ignore" follows the same rule as "git add" and "git
 status" in that the ignore/exclude mechanism does not take effect
 on paths that are already tracked.  With "--no-index" option, it
 can be used to diagnose which paths that should have been ignored
 have been mistakenly added to the index.

 Will squash the tip in and merge to 'next'.


* hu/cherry-pick-previous-branch (2013-09-09) 1 commit
 - cherry-pick: allow "-" as abbreviation of '@{-1}'

 Just like "git checkout -" knows to check out and "git merge -"
 knows to merge the branch you were previously on, teach "git
 cherry-pick" to understand "-" as the previous branch.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 When running "fetch -q", a long silence while the sender side
 computes the set of objects to send can be mistaken by proxies as
 dropped connection.

 Work around a bug in FreeBSD shell that caused a regression to "git
 rebase" in v1.8.4.  It would be lovely to hear from FreeBSD folks a
 success report to make sure we didn't miss any other use of a bare
 "return" from dot-sourced script.

 - t1514: Demonstrate failure to correctly shorten "refs/remotes/origin/HEAD"
 - t1514: Add tests of shortening refnames in strict/loose mode

 When remotes/origin/HEAD is not a symbolic ref, "rev-parse
 --abbrev-ref remotes/origin/HEAD" ought to show "origin", not
 "origin/HEAD", which is fixed with this series (if it is a symbolic
 ref that points at remotes/origin/something, then it should show
 "origin/something" and it already does).

 Expecting a reroll, as an early part of a larger series.

 there are some doubts on the list; kicked back to 'pu'.

 A new option to send a single patch to the standard output to be

 stripping out more MIMEy stuff are left as exercises to interested

 Attempt to resurrect "Type @ for HEAD"; the bottom one seems to be

 HEAD were harder than it should have been.  I think the result of

 People often wished a way to tell "git log --branches" (and "git

 Using the replace mechanism to swap an object with another object
 of a different type can introduce inconsistency (e.g. a tree
 expects an object name to refer to a blob, but the blob object can
 be mistakenly or maliciously replaced with an object with a
 different type). Attempt to forbid such.

 - submodule summary: ignore --for-status option

 Allow "git status" to omit the prefix to make its output a comment

 When the user types "git diff" outside a working tree, thinking he
 is inside one, the current error message that is a single-liner
 "usage: git diff --no-index <path> <path>" may not be sufficient to
 make him realize the mistake. Add "Not a git repository" to the

* jc/reflog-doc (2013-06-19) 1 commit
 - setup_reflog_action: document the rules for using GIT_REFLOG_ACTION

 Document rules to use GIT_REFLOG_ACTION variable in the scripted
 Porcelain.  git-rebase--interactive locally violates this, but it
 is a leaf user that does not call out to or dot-sources other
 scripts, so fixing it is not all that urgent.
