What's cooking in git.git (Apr 2011, #05; Tue, 19)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.

As we are already in pre-release feature freeze, some of the trivially
correct features and fixes to non-regression bugs are only queued to
'next' but not in 'master'.  They are marked as post 1.7.5 candidates in
this list.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* cn/log-parse-opt (2011-04-14) 1 commit
 - log: convert to parse-options

* rr/rerere-clear-libify (2011-04-13) 1 commit
 - rerere: Expose an API corresponding to 'clear' functionality

Jonathan had good comments on moving the garbage collection interface as
well. Perhaps needs a re-roll.

* jk/format-patch-multiline-header (2011-04-14) 1 commit
 - format-patch: wrap email addresses after long names

* jn/format-patch-doc (2011-04-18) 6 commits
 - Documentation/format-patch: suggest Toggle Word Wrap add-on for Thunderbird
 - Documentation: publicize hints for sending patches with GMail
 - Documentation: publicize KMail hints for sending patches inline
 - Documentation: hints for sending patches inline with Thunderbird
 - Documentation: explain how to check for patch corruption
 - Merge v1.7.5-rc2 into jn/format-patch-doc
 (this branch uses jn/maint-format-patch-doc.)

* jn/gitweb-js (2011-04-15) 13 commits
 - gitweb: Make JavaScript ability to adjust timezones configurable
 - gitweb.js: Add UI for selecting common timezone to display dates
 - gitweb: JavaScript ability to adjust time based on timezone
 - gitweb: Unify the way long timestamp is displayed
 - gitweb: Refactor generating of long dates into format_timestamp_html
 - gitweb.js: Provide getElementsByClassName method (if it not exists)
 - gitweb.js: Introduce gitweb/static/js/lib/cookies.js

 - gitweb.js: Update and improve comments in JavaScript files
 - gitweb: Split JavaScript for maintability, combining on build
 - Remove gitweb/gitweb.cgi and other legacy targets from main Makefile
 - git-instaweb: Simplify build dependency on gitweb

* jn/maint-format-patch-doc (2011-04-14) 1 commit
 - Documentation: describe the format of messages with inline patches
 (this branch is used by jn/format-patch-doc.)

* jn/run-command-error-failure (2011-04-19) 1 commit
 - run-command: write full error message in die_child

* ss/cherry-pick-x-doc (2011-04-15) 1 commit
 - doc: Clarify that "cherry-pick -x" does not use "git notes"

* ss/doc-svn (2011-04-19) 1 commit
 - remove noise and inaccuracies from git-svn docs

* vr/merge-base-doc (2011-04-15) 2 commits
 - Restructure documentation for git-merge-base.
 - Documentation: update to git-merge-base --octopus

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* jc/maint-add-p-overlapping-hunks (2011-04-06) 2 commits
 - "add -p": work-around an old laziness that does not coalesce hunks
 - add--interactive.perl: factor out repeated --recount option

This came from http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/170685/focus=171000;
we may want to add tests before moving it forward.

* mg/show-without-prune (2011-04-01) 1 commit
 - builtin/show: do not prune by pathspec
 (this branch uses mg/reflog-with-options.)

I wanted to like this, but it still feels like too much magic.

* gr/cvsimport-alternative-cvspass-location (2011-02-18) 1 commit
 - Look for password in both CVS and CVSNT password files.

It seems that we need separate parsers for these two formats in order not
to regress the users of the original cvs.

* jc/index-pack (2011-02-25) 5 commits
 - index-pack --verify: read anomalous offsets from v2 idx file
 - write_idx_file: need_large_offset() helper function
 - index-pack: --verify
 - write_idx_file: introduce a struct to hold idx customization options
 - index-pack: group the delta-base array entries also by type

Still a WIP, and will not be ready for 1.7.5. Need to put histogram output
into index-pack --verify to really kill verify-pack.

* jk/tag-contains (2010-07-05) 4 commits
 - Why is "git tag --contains" so slow?
 - default core.clockskew variable to one day
 - limit "contains" traversals based on commit timestamp
 - tag: speed up --contains calculation

The idea of the bottom one is probably Ok, except that the use of object
flags needs to be rethought, or at least the helper needs to be moved to
builtin/tag.c to make it clear that it should not be used outside the
current usage context.

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* ef/maint-strbuf-init (2011-04-10) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-04-11 at 1dd34d9)
 + config: support values longer than 1023 bytes
 + strbuf: make sure buffer is zero-terminated

Should graduate soon after 1.7.5 ships and merged to 1.7.4.X and 1.7.5.1
release.

* jh/dirstat (2011-04-12) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-04-12 at dd2c308)
 + --dirstat: In case of renames, use target filename instead of source filename
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-04-11 at 33d0417)
 + Teach --dirstat not to completely ignore rearranged lines within a file
 + --dirstat-by-file: Make it faster and more correct
 + --dirstat: Describe non-obvious differences relative to --stat or regular diff

Should graduate soon after 1.7.5 ships and merged to 1.7.4.X and 1.7.5.1
releases.

* jm/mergetool-submodules (2011-04-13) 1 commit
 - mergetool: Teach about submodules

Looked sane if inefficient when both branches have the submodule but was
dubious in delete/modify conflict case. Awaiting response and possibly a
reroll.

* rj/sparse (2011-04-07) 7 commits
 - sparse: Fix some "symbol not declared" warnings
 - sparse: Fix errors due to missing target-specific variables
 - sparse: Fix an "symbol 'merge_file' not decared" warning
 - sparse: Fix an "symbol 'format_subject' not declared" warning
 - sparse: Fix some "Using plain integer as NULL pointer" warnings
 - sparse: Fix an "symbol 'cmd_index_pack' not declared" warning
 - Makefile: Use cgcc rather than sparse in the check target

* ab/i18n-fixup (2011-04-14) 24 commits
 - i18n: use test_i18n{cmp,grep} in t7600, t7607, t7611 and t7811
 - i18n: use test_i18n{grep,cmp} in t7508
 - i18n: use test_i18ngrep in t7506
 - i18n: use test_i18ngrep and test_i18ncmp in t7502
 - i18n: use test_i18ngrep in t7501
 - i18n: use test_i18ncmp in t7500
 - i18n: use test_i18ngrep in t7201
 - i18n: use test_i18ncmp and test_i18ngrep in t7102 and t7110
 - i18n: use test_i18ncmp and test_i18ngrep in t5541, t6040, t6120, t7004, t7012 and t7060
 - i18n: use test_i18ncmp and test_i18ngrep in t3700, t4001 and t4014
 - i18n: use test_i18ncmp and test_i18ngrep in t3203, t3501 and t3507
 - i18n: use test_i18ngrep in t2020, t2204, t3030, and t3200
 - i18n: use test_i18ngrep in lib-httpd and t2019
 - i18n: do not overuse C_LOCALE_OUTPUT (grep)
 - i18n: use test_i18ncmp in t1200 and t2200
 - i18n: .git file is not a human readable message (t5601)
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-04-12 at a94aa85)
 + i18n: do not overuse C_LOCALE_OUTPUT
 + i18n: mark init-db messages for translation
 + i18n: mark checkout plural warning for translation
 + i18n: mark checkout --detach messages for translation
 + i18n: mark clone nonexistent repository message for translation
 + i18n: mark merge CHERRY_PICK_HEAD messages for translation
 + i18n: mark merge "upstream" messages for translation
 + i18n: mark merge "Could not read from" message for translation

Fix-up patches queued near the tip avoid excessive use of C_LOCALE_OUTPUT
to skip the entire tests. They skip only the parts that need to be skipped
without changing the sequence of commands that are run under GETTEXT_POISON
mode, which should be a big gain.

* cn/format-patch-quiet (2011-04-12) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-04-12 at 915a915)
 + format-patch: document --quiet option
 + format-patch: don't pass on the --quiet flag

Should graduate soon after 1.7.5 ships and merged to 1.7.4.X and 1.7.5.1
release.

* dm/stash-k-i-p (2011-04-07) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-04-11 at 8349531)
 + stash: ensure --no-keep-index and --patch can be used in any order
 + stash: add two more tests for --no-keep-index

Should graduate soon after 1.7.5 ships and merged to 1.7.4.X and 1.7.5.1
releases.

* jc/magic-pathspec (2011-04-06) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-04-08 at c5247ce)
 + magic pathspec: add ":(icase)path" to match case insensitively
 + magic pathspec: futureproof shorthand form
 + magic pathspec: add tentative ":/path/from/top/level" pathspec support
 (this branch is tangled with jc/add-u-migration-2.)

Thanks to Peff, Duy, and Michael for helping to whip the syntax and
the basic semantics into a not-so-horrible shape.  Will not merge until
the 1.7.5 ships, though.

* jc/merge-dash-previous (2011-04-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-04-11 at 06480d1)
 + merge: allow "-" as a short-hand for "previous branch"

Should graduate soon after 1.7.5 ships.

* rr/doc-content-type (2011-04-07) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-04-11 at dca8914)
 + Documentation: Allow custom diff tools to be specified in 'diff.tool'
 + Documentation: Add diff.<driver>.* to config
 + Documentation: Move diff.<driver>.* from config.txt to diff-config.txt
 + Documentation: Add filter.<driver>.* to config

Is everybody happy with the new wording?

Should graduate soon after 1.7.5 ships and merged to 1.7.4.X and 1.7.5.1
releases.

* dm/http-cleanup (2011-03-30) 2 commits
 - http-push: refactor curl_easy_setup madness

I didn't see anything glaringly wrong with this, but I would appreciate
extra sets of eyeballs from people who have worked on HTTP transports to
double check.

* jc/pack-objects-bigfile (2011-04-05) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-04-11 at 86c52b1)
 + Teach core.bigfilethreashold to pack-objects

Should graduate soon after 1.7.5 ships and merged to 1.7.4.X and 1.7.5.1
releases.

* jk/maint-stash-oob (2011-04-06) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-04-11 at d882935)

  (merged to 'next' on 2011-04-11 at d94f6f3)

Are submodule users happy with this change?

Should graduate soon after 1.7.5 ships.

* jk/maint-upload-pack-shallow (2011-04-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-04-11 at 9104545)
 + upload-pack: start pack-objects before async rev-list

A sensible and low-impact fix.  Should graduate soon after 1.7.5 ships
and merged to 1.7.4.X and 1.7.5.1 releases.

* jk/stash-loosen-safety (2011-04-05) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-04-11 at b59c533)
 + stash: drop dirty worktree check on apply

Should graduate soon after 1.7.5 ships.

Should graduate soon after 1.7.5 ships and merged to 1.7.4.X and 1.7.5.1
releases.

* jk/maint-push-async-hang (2011-03-31) 4 commits
 - send-pack: abort sideband demuxer on pack-objects error
 - run-command: allow aborting async code prematurely
 - finish_async: be quiet when waiting for async process
 - teach wait_or_whine a "quiet" mode
 (this branch is used by jk/maint-push-async-hang-threads.)

* jk/maint-push-async-hang-threads (2011-03-31) 2 commits
 - run-command: implement abort_async for pthreads
 - Merge branch 'jk/maint-push-async-hang' into jk/maint-push-async-hang-threads
 (this branch uses jk/maint-push-async-hang.)

These two series aim for a good goal, but needs reroll after 1.7.5 with
sign-offs.

* mg/reflog-with-options (2011-04-01) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-04-03 at e69a95c)
 + reflog: fix overriding of command line options

 + Kill off get_relative_cwd()
 + setup: return correct prefix if worktree is '/'

This benefits only the minority who use /.git at the root level of the
filesystem, but the changed code is used from many codepaths.

Should graduate soon after 1.7.5 ships and merged to 1.7.5.1 release.

* mz/rebase (2011-02-28) 34 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-03-31 at 3b1343c)
 + rebase: define options in OPTIONS_SPEC
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-02-25 at 52caa7a)

I wanted to wait for an independent Ack or two for the tip one, which was
a response to regression concerns raised by J6t, but ended up merging it
to 'next' after giving another look.  Will not merge before 1.7.5, as
there is no user visible improvements up to this point.

* jk/maint-merge-rename-create (2011-03-25) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-03-31 at b9bc9f1)
 + merge: turn on rewrite detection
 + merge: handle renames with replacement content

  (merged to 'next' on 2011-03-31 at c7b3d9a)
 + diffcore-rename: don't consider unmerged path as source

Will cook until 1.7.5 final.

* nd/struct-pathspec (2011-04-05) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-04-11 at ee794a5)
 + pathspec: rename per-item field has_wildcard to use_wildcard
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-03-31 at 66cbb7d)

 + Convert read_tree{,_recursive} to support struct pathspec
 + Reimplement read_tree_recursive() using tree_entry_interesting()
 + Merge branch 'en/object-list-with-pathspec' into 'nd/struct-pathspec'

Will cook until 1.7.5 final.

* jc/rename-degrade-cc-to-c (2011-01-06) 4 commits

Should graduate soon after 1.7.5 ships.

* cn/system-path-tweak (2011-03-17) 1 commit
 - system_path: use a static buffer

Don't see much point in this itself. Probably will drop.

* en/merge-recursive (2011-03-17) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-03-18 at a32016b)
 + merge-recursive: tweak magic band-aid
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-03-09 at 3762932)
 + merge-recursive: When we detect we can skip an update, actually skip it
 + t6022: New test checking for unnecessary updates of files in D/F conflicts
 + t6022: New test checking for unnecessary updates of renamed+modified files

I am not happy with these magic band aids.  Will hold.

--------------------------------------------------
[Discarded]

* jc/add-u-migration (2011-03-22) 3 commits

 (this branch is tangled with jc/add-u-migration and jc/magic-pathspec.)

These attempt "add -u" migration plans (two versions), but then revert
both of them at the end where they are merged to 'next'.
