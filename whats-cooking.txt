What's cooking in git.git (Aug 2020, #04; Tue, 18)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'seen' (formerly 'pu'---proposed updates) while commits prefixed
with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches of the
repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

[Graduated to 'master']

* al/bisect-first-parent (2020-08-07) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-11 at b232f7ca17)
 + bisect: combine args passed to find_bisection()
 + bisect: introduce first-parent flag
 + cmd_bisect__helper: defer parsing no-checkout flag
 + rev-list: allow bisect and first-parent flags
 + t6030: modernize "git bisect run" tests

 "git bisect" learns the "--first-parent" option to find the first
 breakage along the first-parent chain.


* dd/send-email-config (2020-07-23) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-11 at aaf9f3a301)
 + git-send-email: die if sendmail.* config is set

 Stop when "sendmail.*" configuration variables are defined, which
 could be a mistaken attempt to define "sendemail.*" variables.


* es/test-cmp-typocatcher (2020-08-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-11 at ee5557b170)
 + test_cmp: diagnose incorrect arguments

 Test framework update.


* hn/reftable-prep-part-2 (2020-07-27) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-11 at 43ac0bc60a)
 + Make HEAD a PSEUDOREF rather than PER_WORKTREE.
 + Modify pseudo refs through ref backend storage
 + t1400: use git rev-parse for testing PSEUDOREF existence

 Further preliminary change to refs API.


* jc/noop-with-static-inline (2020-08-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-11 at 8a63ff648e)
 + compat-util: type-check parameters of no-op replacement functions

 A no-op replacement function implemented as a C preprocessor macro
 does not perform as good a job as one implemented as a "static
 inline" function in catching errors in parameters; replace the
 former with the latter in <git-compat-util.h> header.


* jk/log-fp-implies-m (2020-07-29) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-03 at 39fefa6b82)
 + doc/git-log: clarify handling of merge commit diffs
 + doc/git-log: move "-t" into diff-options list
 + doc/git-log: drop "-r" diff option
 + doc/git-log: move "Diff Formatting" from rev-list-options
 + log: enable "-m" automatically with "--first-parent"
 + revision: add "--no-diff-merges" option to counteract "-m"
 + log: drop "--cc implies -m" logic
 (this branch is used by so/log-diff-merges-opt.)

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2020-08-01

 "git log --first-parent -p" showed patches only for single-parent
 commits on the first-parent chain; the "--first-parent" option has
 been made to imply "-m".  Use "--no-diff-merges" to restore the
 previous behaviour to omit patches for merge commits.

 Will merge to 'master' together with 'so/log-diff-merges-opt'


* jk/sideband-error-l10n (2020-08-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-11 at 27dbe05a65)
 + sideband: mark "remote error:" prefix for translation

 Mark error message for i18n.


* ma/stop-progress-null-fix (2020-08-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-13 at 8bdec5209f)
 + progress: don't dereference before checking for NULL

 NULL dereference fix.


* pd/mergetool-nvimdiff (2020-07-29) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-11 at 947ce686d0)
 + mergetools: add support for nvimdiff (neovim) family
 + mergetool--lib: improve support for vimdiff-style tool variants

 The existing backends for "git mergetool" based on variants of vim
 have been refactored and then support for "nvim" has been added.


* ps/ref-transaction-hook (2020-08-11) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-11 at 311c045810)
 + t1416: avoid hard-coded sha1 ids
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-10 at d8ad7cc8f6)
 + refs: fix interleaving hook calls with reference-transaction hook

 The logic to find the ref transaction hook script attempted to
 cache the path to the found hook without realizing that it needed
 to keep a copied value, as the API it used returned a transitory
 buffer space.  This has been corrected.
 to be followed by a removal of the caching feature, which does not
 seem to help even as a negative cache.


* rp/apply-cached-with-i-t-a (2020-08-09) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-11 at c28eaa6a0e)
 + t4140: test apply with i-t-a paths
 + apply: make i-t-a entries never match worktree
 + apply: allow "new file" patches on i-t-a entries

 Recent versions of "git diff-files" shows a diff between the index
 and the working tree for "intent-to-add" paths as a "new file"
 patch; "git apply --cached" should be able to take "git diff-files"
 and should act as an equivalent to "git add" for the path, but the
 command failed to do so for such a path.


* so/log-diff-merges-opt (2020-08-11) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-11 at 99e070bdca)
 + t/t4013: add test for --diff-merges=off
 + doc/git-log: describe --diff-merges=off
 + revision: change "--diff-merges" option to require parameter
 (this branch uses jk/log-fp-implies-m.)

 Earlier, to countermand the implicit "-m" option when the
 "--first-parent" option is used with "git log", we added the
 "--[no-]diff-merges" option in the jk/log-fp-implies-m topic.  To
 leave the door open to allow the "--diff-merges" option to take
 values that instructs how patches for merge commits should be
 computed (e.g. "cc"? "-p against first parent?"), redefine
 "--diff-merges" to take non-optional value, and implement "off"
 that means the same thing as "--no-diff-merges".

 Will merge to 'master' together with 'jk/lo-implies-m'.

[New Topics]

* bc/sha-256-doc-updates (2020-08-13) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-17 at 7154a0ce3c)
 + docs: fix step in transition plan
 + docs: document SHA-256 pack and indices

 Further update of docs to adjust to the recent SHA-256 work.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ma/sha-256-docs (2020-08-17) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-17 at 6861142a20)
 + shallow.txt: document SHA-256 shallow format
 + protocol-capabilities.txt: clarify "allow-x-sha1-in-want" re SHA-256
 + index-format.txt: document SHA-256 index format
 + http-protocol.txt: document SHA-256 "want"/"have" format

 Further update of docs to adjust to the recent SHA-256 work.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* dd/diff-customize-index-line-abbrev (2020-08-13) 2 commits
 - diff: index-line: respect --abbrev in object's name
 - revision: differentiate if --no-abbrev asked explicitly

 The output from the "diff" family of the commands had abbreviated
 object names of blobs involved in the patch, but its length was not
 affected by the --abbrev option.  Now it is.

 The first patch is unneeded.


* ds/sha256-leftover-bits (2020-08-17) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-17 at a8e6f9f3f4)
 + multi-pack-index: use hash version byte
 + commit-graph: use the "hash version" byte
 + t/README: document GIT_TEST_DEFAULT_HASH

 midx and commit-graph files now use the byte defined in their file
 format specification for identifying the hash function used for
 object names.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* hn/refs-fetch-head-is-special (2020-08-17) 4 commits
 - refs: read FETCH_HEAD generically
 - refs: move gitdir into base ref_store
 - refs: fix comment about submodule ref_stores
 - Split off reading loose ref data in separate function
 (this branch is used by hn/refs-pseudorefs.)

 The FETCH_HEAD is now always read from the filesystem regardless of
 the ref backend in use, as its format is much richer than the
 normal refs, and written directly by "git fetch" as a plain file..


* hv/ref-filter-misc (2020-08-17) 9 commits
 - ref-filter: add `sanitize` option for 'subject' atom
 - format-support: move `format_sanitized_subject()` from pretty

 - ref-filter: rename `objectname` related functions and fields
 - ref-filter: modify error messages in `grab_objectname()`
 - ref-filter: refactor `grab_objectname()`
 - ref-filter: support different email formats

 The "--format=" option to the "for-each-ref" command and friends
 learned a few more tricks, e.g. the ":short" suffix that applies to
 "objectname" now also can be used for "parent", "tree", etc.


* jc/object-names-are-not-sha-1 (2020-08-14) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-17 at 400fe9e831)
 + messages: avoid SHA-1 in end-user facing messages

 A few end-user facing messages have been update to be
 hash-algorithm agnostic.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 "git add -p" update.

 Doubts?

 - fetch: optionally allow disabling FETCH_HEAD update
 (this branch is used by ds/maintenance-part-1, ds/maintenance-part-2 and jt/lazy-fetch.)

 "git fetch" learned --no-write-fetch-head option to avoid writing
 the FETCH_HEAD file.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 - config: correctly read worktree configs in submodules
 - t/helper/test-config: facilitate addition of new cli options
 - t/helper/test-config: return exit codes consistently

 "git grep" has been tweaked to be limited to the sparse checkout
 paths.

 Review needed on 4/6; otherwise looking sane.

* ls/mergetool-meld-auto-merge (2020-07-12) 2 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - Support auto-merge for meld to follow the vim-diff behavior

 The 'meld' backend of the "git mergetool" learned to give the
 underlying 'meld' the '--auto-merge' option, which would help
 reduce the amount of text that requires manual merging.

 Expecting a reroll.


* mf/submodule-summary-with-correct-repository (2020-06-24) 2 commits
 - submodule: use submodule repository when preparing summary
 - revision: use repository from rev_info when parsing commits

 "git diff/show" on a change that involves a submodule used to read
 the information on commits in the submodule from a wrong repository
 and gave a wrong information when the commit-graph is involved.

 Needs tests.


* dr/push-remoteref-fix (2020-04-23) 1 commit
 - remote.c: fix handling of %(push:remoteref)

 The "%(push:remoteref)" placeholder in the "--format=" argument of
 "git format-patch" (and friends) only showed what got explicitly
 configured, not what ref at the receiving end would be updated when
 "git push" was used, as it ignored the default behaviour (e.g. update
 the same ref as the source).

 Expecting a reroll.

* mr/bisect-in-c-2 (2020-07-17) 14 commits

 . bisect--helper: introduce new `write_in_file()` function
 . bisect--helper: use '-res' in 'cmd_bisect__helper' return
 . bisect--helper: BUG() in cmd_*() on invalid subcommand

 Rewrite of the remainder of "git bisect" script in C continues.

 Needs more work.
 Ejected out of 'seen'; al/bisect-first-parent topic has a bit of
 textual conflict with this topic.


* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2018-10-15) 1 commit
 - zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been

 "git receive-pack" that accepts requests by "git push" learned to
 outsource most of the ref updates to the new "proc-receive" hook.

 Needs review.

 - ci: fix inconsistent indentation

 Aesthetic fix to a CI configuration file.

 Waiting for a reroll.
 It needs a better log message.

  (merged to 'next' on 2020-08-17 at 80498c8659)
 + init: disallow --separate-git-dir with bare repository

 The purpose of "git init --separate-git-dir" is to initialize a
 new project with the repository separate from the working tree,
 or, in the case of an existing project, to move the repository
 (the .git/ directory) out of the working tree. It does not make
 sense to use --separate-git-dir with a bare repository for which
 there is no working tree, so disallow its use with bare
 repositories.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 + diff-lib: use worktree mode in diffs from i-t-a entries

 "git diff [<tree-ish>] $path" for a $path that is marked with i-t-a
 bit was not showing the mode bits from the working tree.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 - maintenance: add trace2 regions for task execution
 - maintenance: add auto condition for commit-graph task
 - maintenance: use pointers to check --auto

 - maintenance: add --task option
 - maintenance: add commit-graph task
 - maintenance: initialize task array
 - maintenance: replace run_auto_gc()
 - maintenance: add --quiet option
 - maintenance: create basic maintenance runner
 (this branch is used by ds/maintenance-part-2; uses jc/no-update-fetch-head; is tangled with jt/lazy-fetch.)

 A "git gc"'s big brother has been introduced to take care of more
 repository maintenance tasks, not limited to the object database
 cleaning.


* es/config-hooks (2020-07-30) 6 commits
 - hook: add 'run' subcommand
 - parse-options: parse into argv_array
 - hook: add --porcelain to list command
 - hook: add list command
 - hook: scaffolding for git-hook subcommand
 - doc: propose hooks managed by the config

 The "hooks defined in config" topic.

 Expecting a reroll.
 Now jk/strvec is in 'master', we may want to see the topic reworked
 on top of it.  Are there unresolved issues, or does the topic need
 a round of detailed review?

 . hex: make hash_to_hex_algop() and friends thread-safe
 . compat/win32/pthread: add pthread_once()

 hash_to_hex() used a set of rotating static buffers, which was not
 safe to use in a threaded environment.  This has been made safer by
 using thread-local storage.

 Retracted.
