What's cooking in git.git (Apr 2021, #06; Thu, 29)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'seen' (formerly 'pu'---proposed updates) while commits prefixed
with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

I am still catching up with the updates of various topics that
happened during my absense, and I'd expect new patches will still
take more time to be queued in 'seen' (as by definition I haven't
seen many of them ;-).

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/

* ab/detox-gettext-tests (2021-04-13) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-04-15 at db0da2903a)
 + tests: remove all uses of test_i18cmp

 Test clean-up.


* ab/usage-error-docs (2021-04-13) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-04-15 at dbbbaa5eea)
 + api docs: document that BUG() emits a trace2 error event
 + api docs: document BUG() in api-error-handling.txt

 Documentation updates, with unrelated comment updates, too.


* ab/userdiff-tests (2021-04-08) 9 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-04-13 at 35fb0e853d)
 + blame tests: simplify userdiff driver test
 + blame tests: don't rely on t/t4018/ directory
 + userdiff: remove support for "broken" tests
 + userdiff tests: list builtin drivers via test-tool
 + userdiff tests: explicitly test "default" pattern
 + userdiff: add and use for_each_userdiff_driver()
 + userdiff style: normalize pascal regex declaration
 + userdiff style: declare patterns with consistent style
 + userdiff style: re-order drivers in alphabetical order

 A bit of code clean-up and a lot of test clean-up around userdiff

  (merged to 'next' on 2021-04-13 at eb80d55a8c)
 + userdiff: add support for Scheme

 Userdiff patterns for "Scheme" has been added.


* hn/reftable-tables-doc-update (2021-04-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-04-13 at cdadb2c621)
 + reftable: document an alternate cleanup method on Windows

 Doc updte.

  (merged to 'next' on 2021-04-15 at 873f7a1f84)
 + doc: clarify "do not capitalize the first word" rule

 Doc update for developers.


* jk/pack-objects-bitmap-progress-fix (2021-04-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-04-13 at bbe18a7b3a)
 + pack-objects: update "nr_seen" progress based on pack-reused count

 When "git pack-objects" makes a literal copy of a part of existing
 packfile using the reachability bitmaps, its update to the progress
 meter was broken.


* js/access-nul-emulation-on-windows (2021-04-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-04-16 at 3017437e51)

  (merged to 'next' on 2021-04-15 at 25c02ce3c3)
 + fetch-pack: buffer object-format with other args
 (this branch is used by jt/push-negotiation.)

 The response to the "object-format" capability in the fetch client
 codepath were malformed, which has been corrected.  It is
 understandable that this bug has been hidden, as practically nobody
 uses the non-standard hash function yet.


* sg/bugreport-fixes (2021-04-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-04-16 at e93602f4df)
 + Makefile: add missing dependencies of 'config-list.h'
 (this branch is used by so/log-diff-merge.)

 The dependencies for config-list.h and command-list.h were broken
 when the former was split out of the latter, which has been
 corrected.

  (merged to 'next' on 2021-04-20 at a90562c59f)
 + doc: clarify the filename encoding in git diff

 Clarify that pathnames recorded in Git trees are most often (but
 not necessarily) encoded in UTF-8.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 "git status" codepath learned to work with sparsely populated index
 without hydrating it fully.


* hn/trace-reflog-expiry (2021-04-27) 1 commit

 The reflog expiry machinery has been taught to emit trace events.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/prune-with-bitmap-fix (2021-04-29) 2 commits
 - prune: save reachable-from-recent objects with bitmaps
 - pack-bitmap: clean up include_check after use

 When the reachability bitmap is in effect, the "do not lose
 recently created objects and those that are reachable from them"
 safety to protect us from races were disabled by mistake, which has
 been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* js/merge-already-up-to-date-message-reword (2021-04-28) 1 commit
 - git-merge: rewrite already up to date message

 A few variants of informational message "Already up-to-date" has
 been rephrased.

 Expecting a reroll.


* jz/apply-3way-first-message-fix (2021-04-29) 1 commit
 - apply: adjust messages to account for --3way changes

 When we swapped the order of --3way fallback, we forgot to adjust
 the message we give when the first method fails and the second
 method is attempted (which used to be "direct application failed
 hence we try 3way", now it is the other way around).

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ls/fast-export-signed (2021-04-28) 3 commits
 - fast-export, fast-import: implement signed-commits
 - fast-export: rename --signed-tags='warn' to 'warn-verbatim'

 "git fast-export" offers a way to control how signed tags are
 handled; the mechanism has been extended to allow specifying how
 signed commits are handled as well.

 Expecting a reroll.

 "git bisect skip" when custom words are used for new/old did not
 work, which has been corrected.


* tv/p4-fallback-encoding (2021-04-28) 1 commit
 - add git-p4.fallbackEncoding config variable, to prevent git-p4 from crashing on non UTF-8 changeset descriptions

 "git p4" learns the fallbackEncoding configuration variable to
 safely accept changeset descriptions that aren't written in UTF-8.

 Expecting a reroll.


* zh/pretty-date-human (2021-04-27) 1 commit
 - pretty: provide human date format
 (this branch uses ab/pretty-date-format-tests.)

 "git log --format=..." placeholders learned %ah/%ch placeholders to
 request the --date=human output.

 Will merge to 'next'?

* ao/p4-avoid-decoding (2021-04-12) 2 commits
 - git-p4: do not decode data from perforce by default
 - git-p4: avoid decoding more data from perforce

 "git p4" in Python-2 days used to accept a lot more kinds of data
 from Perforce server as uninterrupted byte sequence, but after
 switching to Python-3, too many things are expected to be in UTF-8,
 which broke traditional use cases.

 Waiting for reviews.


* hn/refs-trace-errno (2021-04-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-04-20 at 0816e49d22)
 + refs: print errno for read_raw_ref if GIT_TRACE_REFS is set

 Show errno in the trace output in the error codepath that calls
 read_raw_ref method.

 Will merge to 'master'


* ma/t0091-bugreport-fix (2021-04-12) 1 commit
 - t0091-bugreport.sh: actually verify some content of report

 Test fix.

 Expecting a reroll.

* ps/config-global-override (2021-04-27) 4 commits
 - t1300: fix unset of GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM leaking into subsequent tests
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-04-20 at 82578c696d)
 + config: allow overriding of global and system configuration
 + config: unify code paths to get global config paths
 + config: rename `git_etc_config()`

 Replace GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM mechanism to decline from reading the
 system-wide configuration file with GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM that lets
 users specify from which file to read the system-wide configuration
 (setting it to an empty file would essentially be the same as
 setting NOSYSTEM), and introduce GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL to override the
 per-user configuration in $HOME/.gitconfig.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ds/maintenance-prefetch-fix (2021-04-16) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-04-16 at 0a1818e235)
 + maintenance: respect remote.*.skipFetchAll
 + maintenance: use 'git fetch --prefetch'
 + fetch: add --prefetch option
 + maintenance: simplify prefetch logic

 The prefetch task in "git maintenance" assumed that "git fetch"
 from any remote would fetch all its local branches, which would
 fetch too much if the user is interested in only a subset of
 branches there.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* mr/bisect-in-c-4 (2021-04-11) 4 commits
 - bisect--helper: retire `--bisect-next-check` subcommand

 May want to boost the test coverage.


* mt/add-rm-in-sparse-checkout (2021-04-08) 7 commits
 - rm: honor sparse checkout patterns
 - add: warn when asked to update SKIP_WORKTREE entries
 - refresh_index(): add flag to ignore SKIP_WORKTREE entries
 - pathspec: allow to ignore SKIP_WORKTREE entries on index matching
 - add: make --chmod and --renormalize honor sparse checkouts
 - t3705: add tests for `git add` in sparse checkouts
 - add: include magic part of pathspec on --refresh error
 (this branch is used by ds/status-with-sparse-index.)

 "git add" and "git rm" learned not to touch those paths that are
 outside of sparse checkout.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* zh/trailer-cmd (2021-04-17) 2 commits
 - trailer: add new .cmd config option
 - docs: correct description of .command

 The way the command line specified by the trailer.<token>.command
 configuration variable receives the end-user supplied value was
 both error prone and misleading.  An alternative to achieve the
 same goal in a safer and more intuitive way has been added, as
 the trailer.<token>.cmd configuration variable, to replace it.

 Expecting a reroll, after waiting for "commit --trailer" to stabilize.

 (this branch is used by ds/sparse-index-protections and ds/status-with-sparse-index.)

 Both in-core and on-disk index has been updated to optionally omit
 individual entries and replace them with the tree object that
 corresponds to the directory that contains them when the "cone"
 mode of sparse checkout is in use.

 On hold, waiting for the "protections" topic to stablize.


* mt/parallel-checkout-part-2 (2021-04-19) 5 commits

 + parallel-checkout: support progress displaying
 + parallel-checkout: add configuration options
 + parallel-checkout: make it truly parallel

 + sparse-index: API protection strategy
 (this branch is used by ds/status-with-sparse-index; uses ds/sparse-index.)

 Builds on top of the sparse-index infrastructure to mark operations
 that are not ready to mark with the sparse index, causing them to
 fall back on fully-populated index that they always have worked with.

 Will merge to 'master'.
