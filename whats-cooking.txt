What's cooking in git.git (Jun 2017, #01; Thu, 1)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

A bit more topics are now in 'master'.  One unfortunate thing is
that the SHA1 breakage in 2.13 for big-endian platforms were lost in
the noise with excitement felt by some subset of contributors with
the possible use of submodules.  The first step in the series is
neutral to the excitement, and should be fast-tracked down to
'maint' soonish.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

[Graduated to "master"]

* dk/send-email-avoid-net-smtp-ssl-when-able (2017-05-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-05-23 at fc59b8a1d4)
 + send-email: Net::SMTP::SSL is obsolete, use only when necessary

 "git send-email" now uses Net::SMTP::SSL, which is obsolete, only
 when needed.  Recent versions of Net::SMTP can do TLS natively.

 This is somewhat broken; a fix will be merged to 'master' shortly.


* ab/conditional-config-with-symlinks (2017-05-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-05-23 at 6162222c2e)
 + config: match both symlink & realpath versions in IncludeIf.gitdir:*

 The recently introduced "[includeIf "gitdir:$dir"] path=..."
 mechansim has further been taught to take symlinks into account.
 The directory "$dir" specified in "gitdir:$dir" may be a symlink to
 a real location, not something that $(getcwd) may return.  In such
 a case, a realpath of "$dir" is compared with the real path of the
 current repository to determine if the contents from the named path
 should be included.


* ab/perf-wildmatch (2017-05-12) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-05-23 at 0adb7dac31)
 + perf: add test showing exponential growth in path globbing
 + perf: add function to setup a fresh test repo

 Add perf-test for wildmatch.


* bp/sub-process-convert-filter (2017-05-15) 11 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-05-23 at 89f5420a82)
 + convert: update subprocess_read_status() to not die on EOF
 + sub-process: move sub-process functions into separate files
 + convert: rename reusable sub-process functions
 + convert: update generic functions to only use generic data structures
 + convert: separate generic structures and variables from the filter specific ones
 + convert: split start_multi_file_filter() into two separate functions
 + pkt-line: annotate packet_writel with LAST_ARG_MUST_BE_NULL
 + convert: move packet_write_line() into pkt-line as packet_writel()
 + pkt-line: add packet_read_line_gently()
 + pkt-line: fix packet_read_line() to handle len < 0 errors
 + convert: remove erroneous tests for errno == EPIPE

 Code from "conversion using external process" codepath has been
 extracted to a separate sub-process.[ch] module.


* bw/forking-and-threading (2017-05-15) 14 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-05-23 at 79a6a59851)
 + usage.c: drop set_error_handle()
 + run-command: restrict PATH search to executable files
 + run-command: expose is_executable function
 + run-command: block signals between fork and execve
 + run-command: add note about forking and threading
 + run-command: handle dup2 and close errors in child
 + run-command: eliminate calls to error handling functions in child
 + run-command: don't die in child when duping /dev/null
 + run-command: prepare child environment before forking
 + string-list: add string_list_remove function
 + run-command: use the async-signal-safe execv instead of execvp
 + run-command: prepare command before forking
 + t0061: run_command executes scripts without a #! line
 + t5550: use write_script to generate post-update hook

 The "run-command" API implementation has been made more robust
 against dead-locking in a threaded environment.


* bw/pathspec-sans-the-index (2017-05-12) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-05-23 at 45c8ef3115)
 + pathspec: convert find_pathspecs_matching_against_index to take an index
 + pathspec: remove PATHSPEC_STRIP_SUBMODULE_SLASH_CHEAP
 + ls-files: prevent prune_cache from overeagerly pruning submodules
 + pathspec: remove PATHSPEC_STRIP_SUBMODULE_SLASH_EXPENSIVE flag
 + submodule: add die_in_unpopulated_submodule function
 + pathspec: provide a more descriptive die message

 Simplify parse_pathspec() codepath and stop it from looking at the
 default in-core index.


* dt/unpack-save-untracked-cache-extension (2017-05-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-05-23 at 3196d093d6)
 + unpack-trees: preserve index extensions

 When "git checkout", "git merge", etc. manipulates the in-core
 index, various pieces of information in the index extensions are
 discarded from the original state, as it is usually not the case
 that they are kept up-to-date and in-sync with the operation on the
 main index.  The untracked cache extension is copied across these
 operations now, which would speed up "git status" (as long as the
 cache is properly invalidated).


* jc/name-rev-lw-tag (2017-03-29) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-05-23 at 3f88b6d73c)
 + name-rev: favor describing with tags and use committer date to tiebreak
 + name-rev: refactor logic to see if a new candidate is a better name
 (this branch is used by mg/name-rev-debug.)

 "git describe --contains" penalized light-weight tags so much that
 they were almost never considered.  Instead, give them about the
 same chance to be considered as an annotated tag that is the same
 age as the underlying commit would.


* jc/skip-test-in-the-middle (2017-05-18) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-05-23 at 6c962b353b)
 + t5545: enhance test coverage when no http server is installed
 + test: allow skipping the remainder

 A recent update to t5545-push-options.sh started skipping all the
 tests in the script when a web server testing is disabled or
 unavailable, not just the ones that require a web server.  Non HTTP
 tests have been salvaged to always run in this script.


* jh/memihash-opt (2017-05-16) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-05-23 at 2f0293e8b8)
 + p0004: don't error out if test repo is too small
 + p0004: don't abort if multi-threaded is too slow
 + p0004: use test_perf
 + p0004: avoid using pipes
 + p0004: simplify calls of test-lazy-init-name-hash

 perf-test update.


* js/larger-timestamps (2017-05-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-05-23 at 16f7c9e677)
 + name-rev: change a "long" variable to timestamp_t

 A follow-up hotfix for a topic already in 'master'.


* jt/fetch-allow-tip-sha1-implicitly (2017-05-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-05-23 at 690ed987df)
 + fetch-pack: always allow fetching of literal SHA1s

 There is no good reason why "git fetch $there $sha1" should fail
 when the $sha1 names an object at the tip of an advertised ref,
 even when the other side hasn't enabled allowTipSHA1InWant.


* jt/send-email-validate-hook (2017-05-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-05-23 at 89848cb9ac)
 + send-email: support validate hook

 "git send-email" learned to run sendemail-validate hook to inspect
 and reject a message before sending it out.

[New Topics]

* dk/send-email-avoid-net-smtp-ssl-when-able (2017-06-01) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-06-01 at 3ff3ddfac7)
 + send-email: Net::SMTP::starttls was introduced in v2.34

 A hotfix to a topic in 'master'.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ah/doc-rev-parse-short-default (2017-06-01) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-06-01 at f64fcc2a26)
 + doc: rewrite description for rev-parse --short

 Doc update.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* rf/completion-config-commit (2017-05-30) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-06-01 at cea32e0486)
 + completion: add completions for git config commit

 Completion update.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ab/c-translators-comment-style (2017-05-31) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-06-01 at df7fb9199a)
 + C style: use standard style for "TRANSLATORS" comments

 Update the C style recommendation for notes for translators, as
 recent versions of gettext tools can work with our style of
 multi-line comments.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/diff-log-help (2017-06-01) 1 commit
 - diff- and log- family: handle "git cmd -h" early
 (this branch is used by jc/wip-check-help-option.)

 The continuation of jk/consistent-h topic; the plumbing commands in
 the diff- and log- family were calling into the revision machinery
 without repository set-up upon "git $cmd -h", which is fixed.

 Will squeeze into jk/consistent-h topic.


* jk/consistent-h (2017-05-30) 7 commits
 - t0012: test "-h" with builtins
 - git: add hidden --list-builtins option
 - version: convert to parse-options
 - submodule--helper: show usage for "-h"
 - remote-{ext,fd}: print usage message on invalid arguments
 - upload-archive: handle "-h" option early
 - credential: handle invalid arguments earlier
 (this branch uses jk/unbreak-am-h.)

 "git $cmd -h" for builtin commands calls the implementation of the
 command (i.e. cmd_$cmd() function) without doing any repository
 set-up, and the commands that expect RUN_SETUP is done by the Git
 potty needs to be prepared to show the help text without barfing.


* jk/drop-free-refspecs (2017-06-01) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-06-01 at 8f455319fc)
 + remote: drop free_refspecs() function

 Code clean-up.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/unbreak-am-h (2017-05-30) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-06-01 at ee2233d409)
 + am: handle "-h" argument earlier
 (this branch is used by jk/consistent-h.)

 "git am -h" triggered a BUG().

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/url-insteadof-config (2017-06-01) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-06-01 at e7ea6032c2)
 + docs/config: mention protocol implications of url.insteadOf

 The interaction of "url.*.insteadOf" and custom URL scheme's
 whitelisting is now documented better.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* pw/rebase-i-regression-fix (2017-06-01) 1 commit
 - rebase -i: add test for reflog message

 Just the first one of three? new tests that follows up a regression
 fix.

 Expecting a portable update.


* sb/submodule-blanket-recursive (2017-06-01) 9 commits
 - builtin/fetch.c: respect 'submodule.recurse' option
 - builtin/push.c: respect 'submodule.recurse' option
 - builtin/grep.c: respect 'submodule.recurse' option
 - Introduce 'submodule.recurse' option for worktree manipulators
 - submodule loading: separate code path for .gitmodules and config overlay
 - reset/checkout/read-tree: unify config callback for submodule recursion
 - submodule test invocation: only pass additional arguments
 - submodule recursing: do not write a config variable twice
 - Merge branch 'ab/grep-preparatory-cleanup' into sb/submodule-blanket-recursive
 (this branch uses ab/grep-preparatory-cleanup; is tangled with ab/pcre-v2.)

 Many commands learned to pay attention to submodule.recurse
 configuration.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 It is not known if a simple "yes/no" is sufficient in the longer
 term, and what should happen when --recurse-submodules option starts
 taking "recurse into them how?" parameter, though.


* tb/pull-ff-rebase-autostash (2017-06-01) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-06-01 at b5e676d57e)
 + pull: ff --rebase --autostash works in dirty repo

 "git pull --rebase --autostash" didn't auto-stash when the local history
 fast-forwards to the upstream.

 Will merge to 'master'.

[Stalled]

* mg/status-in-progress-info (2017-05-10) 2 commits
 - status --short --inprogress: spell it as --in-progress
 - status: show in-progress info for short status

 "git status" learns an option to report various operations
 (e.g. "merging") that the user is in the middle of.

* mg/name-rev-debug (2017-03-31) 2 commits
 - describe: pass --debug down to name-rev
 - name-rev: provide debug output

 "git describe --debug --contains" did not add any meaningful
 information, even though without "--contains" it did.

 Will discard for now.

 - worktree move: refuse to move worktrees with submodules
 - worktree move: accept destination as directory
 - worktree move: new command
 - worktree.c: add update_worktree_location()
 - worktree.c: add validate_worktree()

* sk/dash-is-previous (2017-03-01) 5 commits
 . revert.c: delegate handling of "-" shorthand to setup_revisions
 . sha1_name.c: teach get_sha1_1 "-" shorthand for "@{-1}"
 . revision.c: args starting with "-" might be a revision
 . revision.c: swap if/else blocks
 . revision.c: do not update argv with unknown option

 A dash "-" can be written to mean "the branch that was previously
 checked out" in more places.

 Ejected, as it seems that making -.. to mean @{-1}..HEAD etc. are
 going too far.

* ab/sha1dc-maint (2017-05-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-05-30 at 9eb40bf912)
 + sha1dc: update from upstream
 (this branch is used by ab/sha1dc.)

 The "collision detecting" SHA-1 implementation shipped with 2.13
 was quite broken on some big-endian platforms and/or platforms that
 do not like unaligned fetches.  Update to the upstream code which
 has already fixed these issues.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 Leakfix.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/pathspec-magic-disambiguation (2017-05-29) 6 commits
 - verify_filename(): flip order of checks
 - verify_filename(): treat ":(magic)" as a pathspec
 - check_filename(): handle ":^" path magic
 - check_filename(): use skip_prefix
 - check_filename(): refactor ":/" handling
 - t4208: add check for ":/" without matching file

 The convention for a command line is to follow "git cmdname
 --options" with revisions followed by an optional "--"
 disambiguator and then finally pathspecs.  When "--" is not there,
 we make sure early ones are all interpretable as revs (and do not
 look like paths) and later ones are the other way around.  A
 pathspec with "magic" (e.g. ":/p/a/t/h" that matches p/a/t/h from
 the top-level of the working tree, no matter what subdirectory you
 are working from) are conservatively judged as "not a path", which
 required disambiguation more often.  The command line parser
 learned to say "it's a pathspec" a bit more often when the syntax
 looks like so.


* sd/t3200-typofix (2017-05-29) 1 commit

 + dir: hide untracked contents of untracked dirs
 + dir: recurse into untracked dirs for ignored files
 + t7061: status --ignored should search untracked dirs
 + t7300: clean -d should skip dirs with ignored files

 "git clean -d" used to clean directories that has ignored files,
 even though the command should not lose ignored ones without "-x".
 "git status --ignored"  did not list ignored and untracked files
 without "-uall".  These have been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ab/sha1dc (2017-05-22) 2 commits
 - sha1collisiondetection: automatically enable when submodule is populated
 - sha1dc: optionally use sha1collisiondetection as a submodule
 (this branch uses ab/sha1dc-maint.)

 The "collission-detecting" implementation of SHA-1 hash we borrowed
 from is replaced by directly binding the upstream project as our
 submodule.

 Will keep in 'pu' for a few CI cycles.
 Impact to the various build and release infrastructure of using
 submodule is not yet fully known, but this lets us dip our toes.


* bp/fsmonitor (2017-05-26) 6 commits
 - fsmonitor: add a sample query-fsmonitor hook script for Watchman
 - fsmonitor: add documentation for the fsmonitor extension.
 - fsmonitor: add test cases for fsmonitor extension
 - fsmonitor: teach git to optionally utilize a file system monitor to speed up detecting new or changed files.
 - dir: make lookup_untracked() available outside of dir.c
 - bswap: add 64 bit endianness helper get_be64


* jk/diff-blob (2017-05-24) 15 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-05-29 at 5ecc979cc7)
 + diff: use blob path for blob/file diffs
 + diff: use pending "path" if it is available
 + diff: use the word "path" instead of "name" for blobs
 + diff: pass whole pending entry in blobinfo
 + handle_revision_arg: record paths for pending objects
 + handle_revision_arg: record modes for "a..b" endpoints
 + t4063: add tests of direct blob diffs
 + get_sha1_with_context: dynamically allocate oc->path
 + get_sha1_with_context: always initialize oc->symlink_path
 + sha1_name: consistently refer to object_context as "oc"
 + handle_revision_arg: add handle_dotdot() helper
 + handle_revision_arg: hoist ".." check out of range parsing
 + handle_revision_arg: stop using "dotdot" as a generic pointer
 + handle_revision_arg: simplify commit reference lookups
 + handle_revision_arg: reset "dotdot" consistently

 The result from "git diff" that compares two blobs, e.g. "git diff
 $commit1:$path $commit2:$path", used to be shown with the full
 object name as given on the command line, but it is more natural to
 use the $path in the output and use it to look up .gitattributes.

* js/bs-is-a-dir-sep-on-windows (2017-05-26) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-05-26 at 450b39f726)
 + Windows: do not treat a path with backslashes as a remote's nick name
 + mingw.h: permit arguments with side effects for is_dir_sep

 "foo\bar\baz" in "git fetch foo\bar\baz", even though there is no
 slashes in it, cannot be a nickname for a remote on Windows, as
 that is likely to be a pathname on a local filesystem.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 - diff.c: factor out diff_flush_patch_all_file_pairs
 - diff: move line ending check into emit_hunk_header
 - diff: readability fix

 "git diff" has been taught to optionally paint new lines that are
 the same as deleted lines elsewhere differently from genuinely new
 lines.


* xz/send-email-batch-size (2017-05-23) 1 commit
 - send-email: --batch-size to work around some SMTP server limit

 "git send-email" learned to overcome some SMTP server limitation
 that does not allow many pieces of e-mails to be sent over a single
 session.

 Waiting for response.

* sg/clone-refspec-from-command-line-config (2017-06-01) 2 commits
 - Documentation/clone: document ignored configuration variables
 - clone: respect additional configured fetch refspecs during initial fetch

 "git clone -c var=val" is a way to set configuration variables in
 the resulting repository, but it is more useful to also make these
 variables take effect while the initial clone is happening,
 e.g. these configuration variables could be fetch refspecs.

 Are we happy with these two?


* jh/close-index-before-stat (2017-04-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-05-16 at 0c0372eb02)
 + read-cache: close index.lock in do_write_index

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2017-04-30

 The timestamp of the index file is now taken after the file is
 closed, to help Windows, on which a stale timestamp is reported by
 fstat() on a file that is opened for writing and data was written
 but not yet closed.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* mb/diff-default-to-indent-heuristics (2017-05-09) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-05-29 at 7645575e21)
 + add--interactive: drop diff.indentHeuristic handling
 + diff: enable indent heuristic by default
 + diff: have the diff-* builtins configure diff before initializing revisions
 + diff: make the indent heuristic part of diff's basic configuration

 Make the "indent" heuristics the default in "diff" and diff.indentHeuristics
 configuration variable an escape hatch for those who do no want it.

 Will merge to 'master'.
 Looks like there may be follow-on work possible, but the topic
 itself is in good order.

* nd/fopen-errors (2017-05-30) 14 commits
 - mingw_fopen: report ENOENT for invalid file names
 - SQUASH??? use test_i18ngrep and add it at the end
 - mingw: verify that paths are not mistaken for remote nicknames
 - log: fix memory leak in open_next_file()
 - rerere.c: move error_errno() closer to the source system call
 - print errno when reporting a system call error
 - wrapper.c: make warn_on_inaccessible() static
 - wrapper.c: add and use fopen_or_warn()
 - wrapper.c: add and use warn_on_fopen_errors()
 - config.mak.uname: set FREAD_READS_DIRECTORIES for Darwin, too
 - config.mak.uname: set FREAD_READS_DIRECTORIES for Linux and FreeBSD
 - clone: use xfopen() instead of fopen()
 - use xfopen() in more places
 - git_fopen: fix a sparse 'not declared' warning

 We often try to open a file for reading whose existence is
 optional, and silently ignore errors from open/fopen; report such
 errors if they are not due to missing files.

 Waiting for an Ack to the SQUASH fix or a reroll of the tip commits.


* js/rebase-i-final (2017-05-02) 10 commits
 - rebase -i: rearrange fixup/squash lines using the rebase--helper
 - t3415: test fixup with wrapped oneline
 - rebase -i: skip unnecessary picks using the rebase--helper
 - rebase -i: check for missing commits in the rebase--helper
 - t3404: relax rebase.missingCommitsCheck tests
 - rebase -i: also expand/collapse the SHA-1s via the rebase--helper
 - rebase -i: do not invent onelines when expanding/collapsing SHA-1s
 - rebase -i: remove useless indentation
 - rebase -i: generate the script via rebase--helper
 - t3415: verify that an empty instructionFormat is handled as before

 The final batch to "git rebase -i" updates to move more code from
 the shell script to C.

 Undecided; expecting a reroll.
 This is at its v4.

* nd/prune-in-worktree (2017-04-24) 12 commits
 - rev-list: expose and document --single-worktree
 - revision.c: --reflog add HEAD reflog from all worktrees
 - files-backend: make reflog iterator go through per-worktree reflog
 - revision.c: --all adds HEAD from all worktrees
 - refs: remove dead for_each_*_submodule()
 - revision.c: use refs_for_each*() instead of for_each_*_submodule()
 - refs: add refs_head_ref()
 - refs: move submodule slash stripping code to get_submodule_ref_store
 - refs.c: refactor get_submodule_ref_store(), share common free block
 - revision.c: --indexed-objects add objects from all worktrees
 - revision.c: refactor add_index_objects_to_pending()
 - revision.h: new flag in struct rev_info wrt. worktree-related refs

 "git gc" and friends when multiple worktrees are used off of a
 single repository did not consider the index and per-worktree refs
 of other worktrees as the root for reachability traversal, making
 objects that are in use only in other worktrees to be subject to
 garbage collection.

 Expecting a reroll.
 Has been waiting for nd/worktree-kill-parse-ref to settle.
