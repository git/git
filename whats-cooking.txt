What's cooking in git.git (Feb 2021, #04; Thu, 18)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'seen' (formerly 'pu'---proposed updates) while commits prefixed
with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

The ninth batch of topics are in 'master'.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

[Graduated to 'master']

* ak/config-bad-bool-error (2021-02-11) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-12 at 76784be663)
 + config: improve error message for boolean config

 The error message given when a configuration variable that is
 expected to have a boolean value has been improved.


* ak/corrected-commit-date (2021-01-18) 11 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-01-26 at deae33ec7d)
 + doc: add corrected commit date info
 + commit-reach: use corrected commit dates in paint_down_to_common()
 + commit-graph: use generation v2 only if entire chain does
 + commit-graph: implement generation data chunk
 + commit-graph: implement corrected commit date
 + commit-graph: return 64-bit generation number
 + commit-graph: add a slab to store topological levels
 + t6600-test-reach: generalize *_three_modes
 + commit-graph: consolidate fill_commit_graph_info
 + revision: parse parent in indegree_walk_step()
 + commit-graph: fix regression when computing Bloom filters
 (this branch is used by ds/chunked-file-api, ds/commit-graph-genno-fix and ds/merge-base-independent.)

 The commit-graph learned to use corrected commit dates instead of
 the generation number to help topological revision traversal.

 Will merge to 'master', together with "ds/commit-graph-genno-fix".


* ds/commit-graph-genno-fix (2021-02-01) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-03 at b3a9e11efb)
 + commit-graph: prepare commit graph
 + commit-graph: be extra careful about mixed generations
 + commit-graph: compute generations separately
 + commit-graph: validate layers for generation data
 + commit-graph: always parse before commit_graph_data_at()
 + commit-graph: use repo_parse_commit
 (this branch uses ak/corrected-commit-date; is tangled with ds/chunked-file-api and ds/merge-base-independent.)

 Fix incremental update of commit-graph file around corrected commit
 date data.

 Will merge to 'master', together with "ak/corrected-commit-date".


* ds/maintenance-pack-refs (2021-02-09) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-11 at 36f56bc9ec)
 + maintenance: incremental strategy runs pack-refs weekly
 + maintenance: add pack-refs task

 "git maintenance" tool learned a new "pack-refs" maintenance task.


* ew/rev-parse-since-test (2021-02-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-11 at 2490918be8)
 + t1500: ensure current --since= behavior remains

 Test to make sure "git rev-parse one-thing one-thing" gives
 the same thing twice (when one-thing is --since=X).


* jk/mailmap-only-at-root (2021-02-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-10 at fbd122fd6c)
 + mailmap: only look for .mailmap in work tree

 The .mailmap is documented to be read only from the root level of a
 working tree, but a stray file in a bare repository also was read
 by accident, which has been corrected.


* js/commit-graph-warning (2021-02-11) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-12 at e9faad550a)
 + commit-graph: when incompatible with graphs, indicate why

 When certain features (e.g. grafts) used in the repository are
 incompatible with the use of the commit-graph, we used to silently
 turned commit-graph off; we now tell the user what we are doing.


* js/fsck-name-objects-fix (2021-02-10) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-10 at 79afd7ebdc)
 + fsck --name-objects: be more careful parsing generation numbers
 + t1450: robustify `remove_object()`

 Fix "git fsck --name-objects" which apparently has not been used by
 anybody who is motivated enough to report breakage.


* js/range-diff-one-side-only (2021-02-06) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-08 at 8c35ed8523)
 + range-diff: offer --left-only/--right-only options
 + range-diff: move the diffopt initialization down one layer
 + range-diff: combine all options in a single data structure
 + range-diff: simplify code spawning `git log`
 + range-diff: libify the read_patches() function again
 + range-diff: avoid leaking memory in two error code paths

 The "git range-diff" command learned "--(left|right)-only" option
 to show only one side of the compared range.


* js/range-diff-wo-dotdot (2021-02-06) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-08 at 9ae8b46d99)
 + range-diff(docs): explain how to specify commit ranges
 + range-diff/format-patch: handle commit ranges other than A..B
 + range-diff/format-patch: refactor check for commit range

 There are other ways than ".." for a single token to denote a
 "commit range", namely "<rev>^!" and "<rev>^-<n>", but "git
 range-diff" did not understand them.


* js/reflog-expire-stale-fix (2021-02-11) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-12 at 899034efca)
 + reflog expire --stale-fix: be generous about missing objects

 "git reflog expire --stale-fix" can be used to repair the reflog by
 removing entries that refer to objects that have been pruned away,
 but was not careful to tolerate missing objects.


* jt/clone-unborn-head (2021-02-05) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-08 at 3ba9f80e7f)
 + clone: respect remote unborn HEAD
 + connect, transport: encapsulate arg in struct
 + ls-refs: report unborn targets of symrefs

 "git clone" tries to locally check out the branch pointed at by
 HEAD of the remote repository after it is done, but the protocol
 did not convey the information necessary to do so when copying an
 empty repository.  The protocol v2 learned how to do so.


* jt/trace2-BUG (2021-02-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-09 at 94911ad676)
 + usage: trace2 BUG() invocations

 Even though invocations of "die()" were logged to the trace2
 system, "BUG()"s were not, which has been corrected.


* jx/t5411-unique-filenames (2021-01-22) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-11 at bc5c67f70f)
 + t5411: refactor check of refs using test_cmp_refs
 + t5411: use different out file to prevent overwriting

 Avoid individual tests in t5411 from getting affected by each other
 by forcing them to use separate output files during the test.


* mr/bisect-in-c-4 (2021-02-03) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-05 at ea18026619)
 + bisect--helper: retire `--check-and-set-terms` subcommand
 + bisect--helper: reimplement `bisect_skip` shell function in C
 + bisect--helper: retire `--bisect-auto-next` subcommand
 + bisect--helper: use `res` instead of return in BISECT_RESET case option
 + bisect--helper: retire `--bisect-write` subcommand
 + bisect--helper: reimplement `bisect_replay` shell function in C
 + bisect--helper: reimplement `bisect_log` shell function in C

 Piecemeal of rewrite of "git bisect" in C continues.


* mt/grep-cached-untracked (2021-02-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-10 at e1fca79104)
 + grep: error out if --untracked is used with --cached

 "git grep --untracked" is meant to be "let's ALSO find in these
 files on the filesystem" when looking for matches in the working
 tree files, and does not make any sense if the primary search is
 done against the index, or the tree objects.  The "--cached" and
 "--untracked" options have been marked as mutually incompatible.


* sh/mergetool-hideresolved (2021-02-09) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-09 at c3ed19b2ec)
 + mergetool: add per-tool support and overrides for the hideResolved flag
 + mergetool: break setup_tool out into separate initialization function
 + mergetool: add hideResolved configuration

 "git mergetool" feeds three versions (base, local and remote) of
 a conflicted path unmodified.  The command learned to optionally
 prepare these files with unconflicted parts already resolved.

 - Makefile: split OBJECTS into OBJECTS and GIT_OBJS
 - Makefile: sort OBJECTS assignment for subsequent change
 - Makefile: split up long OBJECTS line

* jk/symlinked-dotgitx-files (2020-10-23) 9 commits
 - docs: document symlink restrictions for .git* files
 - fsck: complain when .gitattributes or .gitignore is a symlink
 - verify_path(): disallow symlinks in .gitattributes and .gitignore
 - t0060: test obscured .gitattributes and .gitignore matching
 - t7450: test .gitmodules symlink matching against obscured names
 - t7450: test verify_path() handling of gitmodules
 - t7415: rename to expand scope
 - fsck_tree(): wrap some long lines
 - fsck_tree(): fix shadowed variable

 "git fsck" and the corresponding check done during the transport
 learned to ensure that in-tree files like `.gitignore` and
 `.gitattributes` are not symbolic links.

 It seems that there are real projects with .gitignore recorded as
 symlinks, which may need to loosen the fsck setting.  Do we need to
 introduce a class that is separate from symlinked .gitmodules that
 has potential consequences that is more/less grave, so that these
 projects can opt out of the new checks?


* ag/merge-strategies-in-c (2020-11-24) 13 commits
 - sequencer: use the "octopus" merge strategy without forking

 - merge-resolve: rewrite in C
 - merge-index: don't fork if the requested program is `git-merge-one-file'
 - merge-index: libify merge_one_path() and merge_all()
 - merge-one-file: rewrite in C
 - update-index: move add_cacheinfo() to read-cache.c
 - t6060: modify multiple files to expose a possible issue with merge-index
 - t6407: modernise tests

 The resolve and octopus merge strategy backends have been rewritten
 in C.

 Got enough review comments to get updated.

 output.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* mz/doc-notes-are-not-anchors (2021-02-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-17 at 81f92a74b2)
 + docs: clarify that refs/notes/ do not keep the attached objects alive

 Objects that lost references can be pruned away, even when they
 have notes attached to it (and these notes will become dangling,
 which in turn can be pruned with "git notes prune").  This has been
 clarified in the documentation.

* jk/open-dotgitx-with-nofollow (2021-02-16) 6 commits

 - attr: do not respect symlinks for in-tree .gitattributes
 - exclude: add flags parameter to add_patterns()
 - attr: convert "macro_ok" into a flags field

 It does not make sense to make ".gitattributes", ".gitignore" and
 ".mailmap" symlinks, as they are supposed to be usable from the
 object store (think: bare repositories where HEAD:.mailmap etc. are
 used).  When these files are symbolic links, we used to read the
 contents of the files pointed by them by mistake, which has been
 corrected.

 Documentation, code and test clean-up around "git stash".

 Will merge to 'master'.
 This is an early part of a topic that added a new feature to the
 command, but the implementation is expected to need a handful of
 iterations; I split the preparatory part up to fast-track it.

* ab/pager-exit-log (2021-02-01) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-12 at ffe9f2d364)
 + pager: properly log pager exit code when signalled
 + run-command: add braces for "if" block in wait_or_whine()
 + pager: test for exit code with and without SIGPIPE
 + pager: refactor wait_for_pager() function

 When a pager spawned by us exited, the trace log did not record its
 exit status correctly, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.
 The original "what should we do with SIGPIPE?" question remains, though.

 by the multi-pack-index and commit-graph files have been factored
 out, to help codepaths for both filetypes to become more rebust.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ds/merge-base-independent (2021-02-01) 5 commits
 - commit-reach: stale commits may prune generation further
 - commit-reach: use heuristic in remove_redundant()
 - commit-reach: move compare_commits_by_gen
 - commit-reach: use one walk in remove_redundant()
 - commit-reach: reduce requirements for remove_redundant()

 The code to implement "git merge-base --independent" was poorly
 done and was kept from the very beginning of the feature.

 Expecting a reroll.
 cf. <pull.852.v2.git.1612183647.gitgitgadget@gmail.com>

 Will merge to 'master', together with "cm/rebase-i-updates".


* tb/geometric-repack (2021-02-18) 8 commits
 - builtin/repack.c: add '--geometric' option
 - packfile: add kept-pack cache for find_kept_pack_entry()
 - builtin/pack-objects.c: rewrite honor-pack-keep logic

 - revision: learn '--no-kept-objects'
 - packfile: introduce 'find_kept_pack_entry()'

 "git repack" so far has been only capable of repacking everything
 under the sun into a single pack (or split by size).  A cleverer
 strategy to reduce the cost of repacking a repository has been
 introduced.

 cf. <cover.1613618042.git.me@ttaylorr.com>


* ah/rebase-no-fork-point-config (2021-01-21) 1 commit
 - rebase: add a config option for --no-fork-point

 "git rebase --[no-]fork-point" gained a configuration variable
 rebase.forkPoint so that users do not have to keep specifying a
 non-default setting.

 Expecting a reroll to update its tests.

* jt/transfer-fsck-across-packs (2021-01-25) 5 commits
 - SQUASH??? test fix
 - fetch-pack: print and use dangling .gitmodules
 - fetch-pack: with packfile URIs, use index-pack arg
 - http-fetch: allow custom index-pack args
 - http: allow custom index-pack args

 The approach to "fsck" the incoming objects in "index-pack" is
 attractive for performance reasons (we have them already in core,
 inflated and ready to be inspected), but fundamentally cannot be
 applied fully when we receive more than one pack stream, as a tree
 object in one pack may refer to a blob object in another pack as
 ".gitmodules", when we want to inspect blobs that are used as
 ".gitmodules" file, for example.  Teach "index-pack" to emit
 objects that must be inspected later and check them in the calling
 "fetch-pack" process.

 Expecting an update, but perhaps it may be a good approach to
 rebuild the topic on top of ab/fsck-api-cleanup


* bc/signed-objects-with-both-hashes (2021-02-10) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-02-11 at 391cc85104)
 + gpg-interface: remove other signature headers before verifying
 + ref-filter: hoist signature parsing
 + commit: allow parsing arbitrary buffers with headers
 + gpg-interface: improve interface for parsing tags
 + commit: ignore additional signatures when parsing signed commits
 + ref-filter: switch some uses of unsigned long to size_t

 Signed commits and tags now allow verification of objects, whose
 two object names (one in SHA-1, the other in SHA-256) are both
 signed.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 . zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

 Stalled for too long without any activity.
