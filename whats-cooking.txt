What's cooking in git.git (Oct 2022, #07; Wed, 26)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a future
release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and aren't
considered "accepted" at all.  A topic without enough support may be
discarded after a long period of no activity.

The security releases are over, and we have enough accumulated fixes
on the 'master' front, I've merged a handful of them to 'maint'.  We
may or may not have a 2.38.2 release before we conclude this cycle.
We'll see what happens.

Starting from next week (week #4---see https://tinyurl.com/gitCal),
we'll try a mini "bus factor" exercise, where I will disappear from
the list for a few weeks.  Taylor agreed to volunteer as an interim
maintainer and will take over the daily integration of the project
in the meantime.  The branches at https://github.com/git/git/
repository will be updated to reflect the result of daily
integration cycles by the interim maintainer during the exercise.

Other repositories would not be (see below). Most importantly, the
kernel.org one will be likely left stale.  But the interim
maintainer may choose to publish to other repositories and announce
them on this list.  One that may be handy to have is a repository as
a replacement for https://github.com/gitster/git/ repository that
hosts "broken out" topics.

Around week #7, I'll come back and we will conclude the exercise.
Note that the interim maintainer will really make decisions on what
topics to accept and advance to 'next' and 'master' in these weeks,
and I will accept these decisions when I come back and continue from
there.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

 "git log" command resulted in an attempt to access grep pattern
 expression structure that has not been allocated, which has been
 corrected.

 After checking out a "branch" that is a symbolic-ref that points at
 another branch, "git symbolic-ref HEAD" reports the underlying
 branch, not the symbolic-ref the user gave checkout as argument.
 The command learned the "--no-recurse" option to stop after

 - rebase --keep-base: imply --no-fork-point
 - rebase --keep-base: imply --reapply-cherry-picks
 - rebase: factor out branch_base calculation
 - rebase: rename merge_base to branch_base
 - rebase: store orig_head as a commit

 - t3416: set $EDITOR in subshell
 - t3416: tighten two tests
 (this branch is used by pw/rebase-reflog-fixes.)

 "git rebase --keep-base" used to discard the commits that are
 already cherry-picked to the upstream, even when "keep-base" meant
 that the base, on top of which the history is being rebuilt, does
 not yet include these cherry-picked commits.  The --keep-base
 option now implies --reapply-cherry-picks and --no-fork-point
 options.

 the aim of making the reflog easier to parse.
