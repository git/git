What's cooking in git.git (Jan 2013, #09; Fri, 25)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.

As usual, this cycle is expected to last for 8 to 10 weeks, with a
preview -rc0 sometime in the middle of next month.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches of the
repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* as/check-ignore (2013-01-16) 13 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-18 at ef45aff)
 + clean.c, ls-files.c: respect encapsulation of exclude_list_groups
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-14 at 9df2afc)
 + t0008: avoid brace expansion
 + add git-check-ignore sub-command
 + setup.c: document get_pathspec()
 + add.c: extract new die_if_path_beyond_symlink() for reuse
 + add.c: extract check_path_for_gitlink() from treat_gitlinks() for reuse
 + pathspec.c: rename newly public functions for clarity
 + add.c: move pathspec matchers into new pathspec.c for reuse
 + add.c: remove unused argument from validate_pathspec()
 + dir.c: improve docs for match_pathspec() and match_pathspec_depth()
 + dir.c: provide clear_directory() for reclaiming dir_struct memory
 + dir.c: keep track of where patterns came from
 + dir.c: use a single struct exclude_list per source of excludes

 Add a new command "git check-ignore" for debugging .gitignore
 files.  The variable names may want to get cleaned up but that can
 be done in-tree.


* as/pre-push-hook (2013-01-18) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-18 at 37fc4e8)
 + Add sample pre-push hook script
 + push: Add support for pre-push hooks
 + hooks: Add function to check if a hook exists

 Add an extra hook so that "git push" that is run without making
 sure what is being pushed is sane can be checked and rejected (as
 opposed to the user deciding not pushing).


* ch/add-auto-submitted-in-sample-post-receive-email (2013-01-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-18 at e3205db)
 + Add Auto-Submitted header to post-receive-email

 Mark e-mails coming from automated processes should be marked as
 such; update a sample hook to do so.


* cr/push-force-tag-update (2013-01-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-18 at c9091d5)
 + push: fix "refs/tags/ hierarchy cannot be updated without --force"
 (this branch is used by jc/push-reject-reasons.)

 Regression fix, not to say "already exists" when we traditionally
 said "non fast-forward'.


* jc/doc-maintainer (2013-01-03) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-11 at f35d582)
 + howto/maintain: mark titles for asciidoc
 + Documentation: update "howto maintain git"

 Describe tools for automation that were invented since this
 document was originally written.


* jk/suppress-clang-warning (2013-01-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-18 at 7c0bda7)
 + fix clang -Wunused-value warnings for error functions


* mh/imap-send-shrinkage (2013-01-15) 14 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-18 at 1b7c5ba)
 + imap-send.c: simplify logic in lf_to_crlf()
 + imap-send.c: fold struct store into struct imap_store
 + imap-send.c: remove unused field imap_store::uidvalidity
 + imap-send.c: use struct imap_store instead of struct store
 + imap-send.c: remove unused field imap_store::trashnc
 + imap-send.c: remove namespace fields from struct imap
 + imap-send.c: remove struct imap argument to parse_imap_list_l()
 + imap-send.c: inline parse_imap_list() in parse_list()
 + imap-send.c: remove some unused fields from struct store
 + imap-send.c: remove struct message
 + imap-send.c: remove struct store_conf
 + iamp-send.c: remove unused struct imap_store_conf
 + imap-send.c: remove struct msg_data
 + imap-send.c: remove msg_data::flags, which was always zero

 Remove a lot of unused code from "git imap-send".


* mo/cvs-server-updates (2012-12-09) 18 commits

 Various git-cvsserver updates.


* nd/retire-fnmatch (2013-01-01) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-07 at ab31f9b)
 + Makefile: add USE_WILDMATCH to use wildmatch as fnmatch
 + wildmatch: advance faster in <asterisk> + <literal> patterns
 + wildmatch: make a special case for "*/" with FNM_PATHNAME
 + test-wildmatch: add "perf" command to compare wildmatch and fnmatch
 + wildmatch: support "no FNM_PATHNAME" mode
 + wildmatch: make dowild() take arbitrary flags
 + wildmatch: rename constants and update prototype

 Replace our use of fnmatch(3) with a more feature-rich wildmatch.
 A handful patches at the bottom have been moved to nd/wildmatch to
 graduate as part of that branch, before this series solidifies.


* rs/clarify-entry-cmp-sslice (2013-01-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-18 at d584dc6)
 + refs: use strncmp() instead of strlen() and memcmp()

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* jc/push-reject-reasons (2013-01-24) 4 commits
 - push: finishing touches to explain REJECT_ALREADY_EXISTS better
 - push: introduce REJECT_FETCH_FIRST and REJECT_NEEDS_FORCE
 - push: further simplify the logic to assign rejection reason
 - push: further clean up fields of "struct ref"

 Improve error and advice messages given locally when "git push"
 refuses when it cannot compute fast-forwardness by separating these
 cases from the normal "not a fast-forward; merge first and push
 again" case.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* as/test-cleanup (2013-01-24) 1 commit
 - t7102 (reset): don't hardcode SHA-1 in expected outputs

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jc/do-not-let-random-file-interfere-with-completion-tests (2013-01-24) 1 commit
 - t9902: protect test from stray build artifacts

 Scripts to test bash completion was inherently flaky as it was
 affected by whatever random things the user may have on $PATH.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/cvsimport-does-not-work-with-cvsps3 (2013-01-24) 1 commit
 - git-cvsimport.txt: cvsps-2 is deprecated

 Warn people that other tools are more recommendable over
 cvsimport+cvsps2 combo when doing a one-shot import, and cvsimport
 will not work with cvsps3.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/mergetool (2013-01-25) 6 commits
 - mergetool--lib: Improve show_tool_help() output
 - mergetools/vim: Remove redundant diff command
 - git-difftool: use git-mergetool--lib for "--tool-help"
 - git-mergetool: don't hardcode 'mergetool' in show_tool_help
 - git-mergetool: remove redundant assignment
 - git-mergetool: move show_tool_help to mergetool--lib

 Cleans up mergetool/difftool combo.

 It seems John Keeping has some more updates but the version posted
 breaks the tests rather badly.

 Expecting some follow-ups.


* jn/do-not-drop-username-when-reading-from-etc-mailname (2013-01-25) 1 commit
 - ident: do not drop username when reading from /etc/mailname

 We used to stuff "user@" and then append what we read from
 /etc/mailname to come up with a default e-mail ident, but a bug
 lost the "user@" part.  This is to fix it.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* mm/add-u-A-sans-pathspec (2013-01-25) 1 commit
 - add: warn when -u or -A is used without pathspec

 Forbid "git add -u" and "git add -A" without pathspec run from a
 subdirectory, to train people to type "." (or ":/") to make the
 choice of default does not matter.

 Will merge to 'next'.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* mp/complete-paths (2013-01-11) 1 commit
 - git-completion.bash: add support for path completion

 The completion script used to let the default completer to suggest
 pathnames, which gave too many irrelevant choices (e.g. "git add"
 would not want to add an unmodified path).  Teach it to use a more
 git-aware logic to enumerate only relevant ones.

 Waiting for area-experts' help and review.


* jl/submodule-deinit (2012-12-04) 1 commit
 - submodule: add 'deinit' command

 There was no Porcelain way to say "I no longer am interested in
 this submodule", once you express your interest in a submodule with
 "submodule init".  "submodule deinit" is the way to do so.

 Expecting a reroll.
 $gmane/212884


* jk/lua-hackery (2012-10-07) 6 commits
 - pretty: fix up one-off format_commit_message calls
 - Minimum compilation fixup
 - Makefile: make "lua" a bit more configurable
 - add a "lua" pretty format
 - add basic lua infrastructure
 - pretty: make some commit-parsing helpers more public

 Interesting exercise. When we do this for real, we probably would want
 to wrap a commit to make it more like an "object" with methods like
 "parents", etc.


* rc/maint-complete-git-p4 (2012-09-24) 1 commit
 - Teach git-completion about git p4

 Comment from Pete will need to be addressed ($gmane/206172).


* jc/maint-name-rev (2012-09-17) 7 commits
 - describe --contains: use "name-rev --algorithm=weight"
 - name-rev --algorithm=weight: tests and documentation
 - name-rev --algorithm=weight: cache the computed weight in notes
 - name-rev --algorithm=weight: trivial optimization
 - name-rev: --algorithm option
 - name_rev: clarify the logic to assign a new tip-name to a commit
 - name-rev: lose unnecessary typedef

 "git name-rev" names the given revision based on a ref that can be
 reached in the smallest number of steps from the rev, but that is
 not useful when the caller wants to know which tag is the oldest one
 that contains the rev.  This teaches a new mode to the command that
 uses the oldest ref among those which contain the rev.

 I am not sure if this is worth it; for one thing, even with the help
 from notes-cache, it seems to make the "describe --contains" even
 slower. Also the command will be unusably slow for a user who does
 not have a write access (hence unable to create or update the
 notes-cache).

 Stalled mostly due to lack of responses.


* jc/xprm-generation (2012-09-14) 1 commit
 - test-generation: compute generation numbers and clock skews

 A toy to analyze how bad the clock skews are in histories of real
 world projects.

 Stalled mostly due to lack of responses.


* jc/add-delete-default (2012-08-13) 1 commit
 - git add: notice removal of tracked paths by default

 "git add dir/" updated modified files and added new files, but does
 not notice removed files, which may be "Huh?" to some users.  They
 can of course use "git add -A dir/", but why should they?

 Resurrected from graveyard, as I thought it was a worthwhile thing
 to do in the longer term.

 Stalled mostly due to lack of responses.


* mb/remote-default-nn-origin (2012-07-11) 6 commits
 - Teach get_default_remote to respect remote.default.
 - Test that plain "git fetch" uses remote.default when on a detached HEAD.
 - Teach clone to set remote.default.
 - Teach "git remote" about remote.default.
 - Teach remote.c about the remote.default configuration setting.
 - Rename remote.c's default_remote_name static variables.

 When the user does not specify what remote to interact with, we
 often attempt to use 'origin'.  This can now be customized via a
 configuration variable.

 Expecting a reroll.
 $gmane/210151

 "The first remote becomes the default" bit is better done as a
 separate step.


* nd/parse-pathspec (2013-01-11) 20 commits
 . Convert more init_pathspec() to parse_pathspec()
 . Convert add_files_to_cache to take struct pathspec
 . Convert {read,fill}_directory to take struct pathspec
 . Convert refresh_index to take struct pathspec
 . Convert report_path_error to take struct pathspec
 . checkout: convert read_tree_some to take struct pathspec
 . Convert unmerge_cache to take struct pathspec
 . Convert read_cache_preload() to take struct pathspec
 . add: convert to use parse_pathspec
 . archive: convert to use parse_pathspec
 . ls-files: convert to use parse_pathspec
 . rm: convert to use parse_pathspec
 . checkout: convert to use parse_pathspec
 . rerere: convert to use parse_pathspec
 . status: convert to use parse_pathspec
 . commit: convert to use parse_pathspec
 . clean: convert to use parse_pathspec
 . Export parse_pathspec() and convert some get_pathspec() calls
 . Add parse_pathspec() that converts cmdline args to struct pathspec
 . pathspec: save the non-wildcard length part

 Uses the parsed pathspec structure in more places where we used to
 use the raw "array of strings" pathspec.

 Ejected from 'pu' for now; will take a look at the rerolled one
 later ($gmane/213340).

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* bc/fix-array-syntax-for-3.0-in-completion-bash (2013-01-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-25 at d113c1a)
 + git-completion.bash: replace zsh notation that breaks bash 3.X

 Fix use of an array notation that older versions of bash do not
 understand.


* jc/help (2013-01-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-25 at b2b087e)
 + help: include <common-cmds.h> only in one file

 A header file that has the definition of a static array was
 included in two places, wasting the space.


* jc/hidden-refs (2013-01-18) 2 commits
 - upload-pack: allow hiding ref hiearchies
 - upload-pack: share more code

 Allow the server side to unclutter the refs/ namespace it shows by
 default, while still allowing requests for histories leading to the
 tips of hidden refs by updated clients (which are not written yet).


* jk/update-install-for-p4 (2013-01-20) 1 commit
 - INSTALL: git-p4 doesn't support Python 3

 Will merge to 'next'.


* tb/t0050-maint (2013-01-21) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-25 at 682b1e2)
 + t0050: Use TAB for indentation
 + t0050: honor CASE_INSENSITIVE_FS in add (with different case)
 + t0050: known breakage vanished in merge (case change)

 Update tests that were expecting to fail due to a bug that was
 fixed earlier.


* nd/magic-pathspec-from-root (2013-01-21) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-25 at b056b57)
 + grep: avoid accepting ambiguous revision
 + Update :/abc ambiguity check

 When giving arguments without "--" disambiguation, object names
 that come  earlier on the command line must not be interpretable as
 pathspecs and pathspecs that come later on the command line must
 not be interpretable as object names.  Tweak the disambiguation
 rule so that ":/" (no other string before or after) is always
 interpreted as a pathspec, to avoid having to say "git cmd -- :/".


* ta/doc-no-small-caps (2013-01-22) 10 commits
 - fixup! Change 'git' to 'Git' whenever the whole system is referred to #4
 - Change 'git' to 'Git' whenever the whole system is referred to #4
 - fixup! Change 'git' to 'Git' whenever the whole system is referred to #3
 - Change 'git' to 'Git' whenever the whole system is referred to #3
 - fixup! Change 'git' to 'Git' whenever the whole system is referred to #2
 - Change 'git' to 'Git' whenever the whole system is referred to #2
 - fixup! fixup! Change 'git' to 'Git' whenever the whole system is referred to #1
 - fixup! Change 'git' to 'Git' whenever the whole system is referred to #1
 - Change 'git' to 'Git' whenever the whole system is referred to #1
 - Documentation: avoid poor-man's small caps

 Update documentation to change "GIT" which was a poor-man's small
 caps to "Git" which was the intended spelling.  Also change "git"
 spelled in all-lowercase to "Git" when it refers to the system as
 the whole or the concept it embodies, as opposed to the command the
 end users would type.

 Will wait for a week or so (say, til end of January) for Thomas to
 collect fix-ups, squash the result into two patches and then merge
 to 'next'.


* rr/minimal-stat (2013-01-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-25 at 11c4453)
 + Enable minimal stat checking

 Some reimplementations of Git does not write all the stat info back
 to the index due to their implementation limitations (e.g. jgit
 running on Java).  A configuration option can tell Git to ignore
 changes to most of the stat fields and only pay attention to mtime
 and size, which these implementations can reliably update.  This
 avoids excessive revalidation of contents.


* jc/remove-treesame-parent-in-simplify-merges (2013-01-17) 1 commit
 - simplify-merges: drop merge from irrelevant side branch

 The --simplify-merges logic did not cull irrelevant parents from a
 merge that is otherwise not interesting with respect to the paths
 we are following.

 As this touches a fairly core part of the revision traversal
 infrastructure, it is appreciated to have an extra set of eyes for
 sanity check.

 Waiting for reviews and comments.


* jk/remote-helpers-in-python-3 (2013-01-24) 8 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-25 at acf9419)
 + git-remote-testpy: call print as a function
 + git-remote-testpy: don't do unbuffered text I/O
 + git-remote-testpy: hash bytes explicitly
 + svn-fe: allow svnrdump_sim.py to run with Python 3
 + git_remote_helpers: use 2to3 if building with Python 3
 + git_remote_helpers: force rebuild if python version changes
 + git_remote_helpers: fix input when running under Python 3
 + git_remote_helpers: allow building with Python 3

 Prepare remote-helper test written in Python to be run with Python3.


* dl/am-hg-locale (2013-01-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-25 at 3419019)
 + am: invoke perl's strftime in C locale

 Datestamp recorded in "Hg" format patch was reformatted incorrectly
 to an e-mail looking date using locale dependant strftime, causing
 patch application to fail.


* jk/config-parsing-cleanup (2013-01-23) 8 commits
 - reflog: use parse_config_key in config callback
 - help: use parse_config_key for man config
 - submodule: simplify memory handling in config parsing
 - submodule: use parse_config_key when parsing config
 - userdiff: drop parse_driver function
 - convert some config callbacks to parse_config_key
 - archive-tar: use parse_config_key when parsing config
 - config: add helper function for parsing key names

 Configuration parsing for tar.* configuration variables were
 broken. Introduce a new config-keyname parser API to make the
 callers much less error prone.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* mp/diff-algo-config (2013-01-16) 3 commits
 - diff: Introduce --diff-algorithm command line option
 - config: Introduce diff.algorithm variable
 - git-completion.bash: Autocomplete --minimal and --histogram for git-diff

 Add diff.algorithm configuration so that the user does not type
 "diff --histogram".

 Looking better; may want tests to protect it from future breakages,
 but otherwise it looks ready for 'next'.

 Expecting a follow-up to add tests.


* jc/custom-comment-char (2013-01-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-25 at 91d8a5d)
 + Allow custom "comment char"

 An illustration to show codepaths that need to be touched to change
 the hint lines in the edited text to begin with something other
 than '#'.

 This is half my work and half by Ralf Thielow.  There may still be
 leftover '#' lurking around, though.  My "git grep" says C code
 should be already fine, but git-rebase--interactive.sh could be
 converted (it should not matter, as the file is not really a
 free-form text).

 I don't know how useful this will be in real life, though.


* nd/fetch-depth-is-broken (2013-01-11) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-15 at 70a5ca7)
 + fetch: elaborate --depth action
 + upload-pack: fix off-by-one depth calculation in shallow clone
 + fetch: add --unshallow for turning shallow repo into complete one

 "git fetch --depth" was broken in at least three ways.  The
 resulting history was deeper than specified by one commit, it was
 unclear how to wipe the shallowness of the repository with the
 command, and documentation was misleading.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* jc/no-git-config-in-clone (2013-01-11) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-15 at feeffe1)
 + clone: do not export and unexport GIT_CONFIG

 We stopped paying attention to $GIT_CONFIG environment that points
 at a single configuration file from any command other than "git config"
 quite a while ago, but "git clone" internally set, exported, and
 then unexported the variable during its operation unnecessarily.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* dg/subtree-fixes (2013-01-08) 7 commits
 - contrib/subtree: mkdir the manual directory if needed
 - contrib/subtree: honor $(DESTDIR)
 - contrib/subtree: fix synopsis and command help
 - contrib/subtree: better error handling for "add"
 - contrib/subtree: add --unannotate option
 - contrib/subtree: use %B for split Subject/Body
 - t7900: remove test number comments

 contrib/subtree updates; there are a few more from T. Zheng that
 were posted separately, with an overlap.

 Expecting a reroll.


* jc/push-2.0-default-to-simple (2013-01-16) 14 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-16 at 23f5df2)
 + t5570: do not assume the "matching" push is the default
 + t5551: do not assume the "matching" push is the default
 + t5550: do not assume the "matching" push is the default
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-09 at 74c3498)
 + doc: push.default is no longer "matching"
 + push: switch default from "matching" to "simple"
 + t9401: do not assume the "matching" push is the default
 + t9400: do not assume the "matching" push is the default
 + t7406: do not assume the "matching" push is the default
 + t5531: do not assume the "matching" push is the default
 + t5519: do not assume the "matching" push is the default
 + t5517: do not assume the "matching" push is the default
 + t5516: do not assume the "matching" push is the default
 + t5505: do not assume the "matching" push is the default
 + t5404: do not assume the "matching" push is the default

 Will cook in 'next' until Git 2.0 ;-).


* mb/gitweb-highlight-link-target (2012-12-20) 1 commit
 - Highlight the link target line in Gitweb using CSS

 Expecting a reroll.
 $gmane/211935


* bc/append-signed-off-by (2013-01-21) 10 commits
 - Unify appending signoff in format-patch, commit and sequencer
 - format-patch: update append_signoff prototype
 - t4014: more tests about appending s-o-b lines
 - sequencer.c: teach append_signoff to avoid adding a duplicate newline
 - sequencer.c: teach append_signoff how to detect duplicate s-o-b
 - sequencer.c: always separate "(cherry picked from" from commit body
 - sequencer.c: recognize "(cherry picked from ..." as part of s-o-b footer
 - t/t3511: add some tests of 'cherry-pick -s' functionality
 - t/test-lib-functions.sh: allow to specify the tag name to test_commit
 - sequencer.c: remove broken support for rfc2822 continuation in footer

 Rerolled.

 Expecting another reroll.

 . t9604: fixup for new cvsimport
 . t9600: fixup for new cvsimport

 Rerolled as jc/cvsimport-upgrade.


* jc/valgrind-memcmp-bsearch (2013-01-14) 1 commit
 . ignore memcmp() overreading in bsearch() callback

 Squelch false positive in valgrind tests; made unnecessary by
 rewriting the callsite that confuses the tool.


* rs/archive-tar-config-parsing-fix (2013-01-14) 1 commit
 . archive-tar: fix sanity check in config parsing

 jk/config-parsing-cleanup made this topic unneeded.


* jc/cvsimport-upgrade (2013-01-14) 8 commits
 - t9600: adjust for new cvsimport
 - t9600: further prepare for sharing
 - cvsimport-3: add a sample test
 - cvsimport: make tests reusable for cvsimport-3
 - cvsimport: start adding cvsps 3.x support
 - cvsimport: introduce a version-switch wrapper
 - cvsimport: allow setting a custom cvsps (2.x) program name
 - Makefile: add description on PERL/PYTHON_PATH
