What's cooking in git.git (Mar 2018, #05; Wed, 28)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

Git 2.17 final is expected to be tagged by early next week.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

[Graduated to "master"]

* bp/refresh-cache-ent-rehash-fix (2018-03-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-15 at bac8745f08)
 + Fix bugs preventing adding updated cache entries to the name hash

 The codepath to replace an existing entry in the index had a bug in
 updating the name hash structure, which has been fixed.


* dp/merge-strategy-doc-fix (2018-03-19) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-20 at 317e077588)
 + Documentation/merge-strategies: typofix

 Doc fix.


* jh/fsck-promisors (2018-03-13) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-15 at 0c283dbe5e)
 + sha1_file: restore OBJECT_INFO_QUICK functionality

 A hotfix to a topic that graduated recently.


* jk/attributes-path-doc (2018-03-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-20 at e965f0c68c)
 + doc/gitattributes: mention non-recursive behavior

 Doc update.


* js/ming-strftime (2018-03-19) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-20 at a9ca8172c7)
 + mingw: abort on invalid strftime formats


* jt/transfer-fsck-with-promissor (2018-03-15) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-15 at 6d1ccc965b)
 + fetch-pack: do not check links for partial fetch
 + index-pack: support checking objects but not links

 The transfer.fsckobjects configuration tells "git fetch" to
 validate the data and connected-ness of objects in the received
 pack; the code to perform this check has been taught about the
 narrow clone's convention that missing objects that are reachable
 from objects in a pack that came from a promissor remote is OK.


* ks/t3200-typofix (2018-03-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-15 at 8b8d397787)
 + t/t3200: fix a typo in a test description

 Test typofix.


* ma/config-page-only-in-list-mode (2018-02-21) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-15 at 652430af12)
 + config: change default of `pager.config` to "on"
 + config: respect `pager.config` in list/get-mode only
 + t7006: add tests for how git config paginates

 In a way similar to how "git tag" learned to honor the pager
 setting only in the list mode, "git config" learned to ignore the
 pager setting when it is used for setting values (i.e. when the
 purpose of the operation is not to "show").


* ma/skip-writing-unchanged-index (2018-03-01) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-15 at cdbbc66464)
 + write_locked_index(): add flag to avoid writing unchanged index

 Internal API clean-up to allow write_locked_index() optionally skip
 writing the in-core index when it is not modified.


* ml/filter-branch-portability-fix (2018-03-19) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-20 at c7c17cfc8b)
 + filter-branch: use printf instead of echo -e

 Shell script portability fix.


* nd/parseopt-completion (2018-03-23) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-23 at 2bee77135e)
 + t9902: disable test on the list of merge-strategies under GETTEXT_POISON
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-22 at 279765c437)
 + completion: clear cached --options when sourcing the completion script
 (this branch is used by nd/parseopt-completion-more.)

 Hotfix for recently graduated topic that give help to completion
 scripts from the Git subcommands that are being completed


* pc/submodule-helper (2018-03-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-27 at 362e0ef09b)
 + submodule deinit: handle non existing pathspecs gracefully

 Hotfix.


* rj/http-code-cleanup (2018-03-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-15 at 0dfd462ff8)
 + http: fix an unused variable warning for 'curl_no_proxy'

 There was an unused file-scope static variable left in http.c when
 building for versions of libCURL that is older than 7.19.4, which
 has been fixed.

 This will become unnecessary, when we follow-through the
 jk/drop-ancient-curl topic.


* rj/warning-uninitialized-fix (2018-03-20) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-20 at 9ac9d02b0b)
 + read-cache: fix an -Wmaybe-uninitialized warning
 + -Wuninitialized: remove some 'init-self' workarounds

 Compilation fix.


* tg/stash-doc-typofix (2018-03-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-27 at 144a25f09c)
 + git-stash.txt: remove extra square bracket

 Hotfix.


* tz/complete-tag-delete-tagname (2018-03-19) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-20 at d63d45ff16)
 + completion: complete tags with git tag --delete/--verify


* tz/relnotes-1.7-on-perl (2018-03-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-20 at ed4b26e581)
 + RelNotes: add details on Perl module changes

* mk/http-backend-content-length (2017-11-27) 4 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - t5560-http-backend-noserver.sh: add CONTENT_LENGTH cases
 - SQUASH???
 - http-backend: respect CONTENT_LENGTH as specified by rfc3875

 The http-backend (used for smart-http transport) used to slurp the
 whole input until EOF, without paying attention to CONTENT_LENGTH
 that is supplied in the environment and instead expecting the Web
 server to close the input stream.  This has been fixed.

 Expecting a reroll.
 Suggested fixes to be used when rerolling is queued, but I'd
 prefer _not_ squashing them myself.

 Also, it may be too complex solution for the problem.
 cf. <20171204171308.GA13332@sigill.intra.peff.net>


* jk/drop-ancient-curl (2017-08-09) 5 commits
 - http: #error on too-old curl
 - curl: remove ifdef'd code never used with curl >=7.19.4
 - http: drop support for curl < 7.19.4
 - http: drop support for curl < 7.16.0
 - http: drop support for curl < 7.11.1

 Some code in http.c that has bitrot is being removed.

 Expecting a reroll.


* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2017-08-10) 1 commit
 . zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

 Needs resurrecting by making sure the fix is good and still applies
 (or adjusted to today's codebase).

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* ml/filter-branch-no-op-error (2018-03-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-15 at ba8ac48dec)
 + filter-branch: return 2 when nothing to rewrite

 "git filter-branch" learned to use a different exit code to allow
 the callers to tell the case where there was no new commits to
 rewrite from other error cases.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* ab/install-symlinks (2018-03-15) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-15 at 99d6bd6cb3)
 + Makefile: optionally symlink libexec/git-core binaries to bin/git
 + Makefile: add a gitexecdir_relative variable
 + Makefile: fix broken bindir_relative variable

 The build procedure learned to optionally use symbolic links
 (instead of hardlinks and copies) to install "git-foo" for built-in
 commands, whose binaries are all identical.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* tg/stash-untracked-with-pathspec-fix (2018-03-21) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-22 at 73c4bef74f)
 + stash: drop superfluos pathspec parameter
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-21 at 8f5b5ab131)
 + stash push -u: don't create empty stash
 + stash push: avoid printing errors
 + stash: fix nonsense pipeline

 "git stash push -u -- <pathspec>" gave an unnecessary and confusing
 error message when there was no tracked files that match the
 <pathspec>, which has been fixed.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* pw/rebase-keep-empty-fixes (2018-03-20) 4 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - rebase: respect --no-keep-empty
 - rebase -i --keep-empty: don't prune empty commits
 - rebase --root: stop assuming squash_onto is unset
 (this branch is used by pw/rebase-signoff.)

 "git rebase --keep-empty" still removed an empty commit if the
 other side contained an empty commit (due to the "does an
 equivalent patch exist already?" check), which has been corrected.


* pw/rebase-signoff (2018-03-20) 4 commits
 - rebase --keep-empty: always use interactive rebase
 - rebase -p: error out if --signoff is given
 - rebase: extend --signoff support
 - Merge branch 'pw/rebase-keep-empty-fixes' into pw/rebase-signoff
 (this branch uses pw/rebase-keep-empty-fixes.)

 "git rebase" has learned to honor "--signoff" option when using
 backends other than "am" (but not "--preserve-merges").


* dj/runtime-prefix (2018-03-25) 3 commits
 - exec_cmd: RUNTIME_PREFIX on some POSIX systems
 - Makefile: add Perl runtime prefix support
 - Makefile: generate Perl header from template file
 (this branch is used by js/runtime-prefix-windows.)

 A build-time option has been added to allow Git to be told to refer
 to its associated files relative to the main binary, in the same
 way that has been possible on Windows for quite some time, for
 Linux, BSDs and Darwin.


* ti/fetch-everything-local-optim (2018-03-14) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-15 at 2be87aa7a7)
 + fetch-pack.c: use oidset to check existence of loose object

 A "git fetch" from a repository with insane number of refs into a
 repository that is already up-to-date still wasted too many cycles
 making many lstat(2) calls to see if these objects at the tips
 exist as loose objects locally.  These lstat(2) calls are optimized
 away by enumerating all loose objects beforehand.

 It is unknown if the new strategy negatively affects existing use
 cases, fetching into a repository with many loose objects from a
 repository with small number of refs.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* ab/nuke-emacs-contrib (2018-03-13) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-15 at 13eb4e2d8b)
 + git{,-blame}.el: remove old bitrotting Emacs code

 The scripts in contrib/emacs/ have outlived their usefulness and
 have been removed.

 Will cook in 'next'.

* ma/shortlog-revparse (2018-03-15) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-15 at 2c2de7eb95)
 + shortlog: disallow left-over arguments outside repo
 + shortlog: add usage-string for stdin-reading
 + git-shortlog.txt: reorder usages

 "git shortlog cruft" aborted with a BUG message when run outside a
 Git repository.  The command has been taught to complain about
 extra and unwanted arguments on its command line instead in such a
 case.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* ab/pcre-v2 (2018-03-14) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-15 at e77b116903)
 + Makefile: make USE_LIBPCRE=YesPlease mean v2, not v1
 + configure: detect redundant --with-libpcre & --with-libpcre1
 + configure: fix a regression in PCRE v1 detection

 Git can be built to use either v1 or v2 of the PCRE library, and so
 far, the build-time configuration USE_LIBPCRE=YesPlease instructed
 the build procedure to use v1, but now it means v2.  USE_LIBPCRE1
 and USE_LIBPCRE2 can be used to explicitly choose which version to
 use, as before.

 Will cook in 'next'.

 - Merge branch 'bp/bind-kp-enter' of git-gui into bp/git-gui-bind-kp-enter
 - git-gui: bind CTRL/CMD+numpad ENTER to do_commit

 "git gui" performs commit upon CTRL/CMD+ENTER but the
 CTRL/CMD+KP_ENTER (i.e. enter key on the numpad) did not have the
 same key binding.  It now does.


* cb/git-gui-ttk-style (2018-03-05) 2 commits
 - Merge branch 'cb/ttk-style' of git-gui into cb/git-gui-ttk-style
 - git-gui: workaround ttk:style theme use

 "git gui" has been taught to work with old versions of tk (like
 8.5.7) that do not support "ttk::style theme use" as a way to query
 the current theme.


* nd/pack-objects-pack-struct (2018-03-26) 13 commits
 - pack-objects: reorder members to shrink struct object_entry
 - pack-objects: shrink delta_size field in struct object_entry
 - pack-objects: shrink size field in struct object_entry
 - pack-objects: clarify the use of object_entry::size
 - pack-objects: don't check size when the object is bad
 - pack-objects: shrink z_delta_size field in struct object_entry
 - pack-objects: refer to delta objects by index instead of pointer
 - pack-objects: move in_pack out of struct object_entry
 - pack-objects: move in_pack_pos out of struct object_entry
 - pack-objects: use bitfield for object_entry::depth
 - pack-objects: use bitfield for object_entry::dfs_state
 - pack-objects: turn type and in_pack_type to bitfields
 - pack-objects: a bit of document about struct object_entry

 "git pack-objects" needs to allocate tons of "struct object_entry"
 while doing its work, and shrinking its size helps the performance
 quite a bit.


* nd/repack-keep-pack (2018-03-26) 7 commits
 - pack-objects: show some progress when counting kept objects
 - gc --auto: exclude base pack if not enough mem to "repack -ad"
 - gc: handle a corner case in gc.bigPackThreshold
 - gc: add gc.bigPackThreshold config
 - gc: add --keep-largest-pack option
 - repack: add --keep-pack option
 - t7700: have closing quote of a test at the beginning of line

 "git gc" in a large repository takes a lot of time as it considers
 to repack all objects into one pack by default.  The command has
 been taught to pretend as if the largest existing packfile is
 marked with ".keep" so that it is left untouched while objects in
 other packs and loose ones are repacked.

 Reroll exists, but it seems to be still slushy.

* nd/worktree-prune (2018-03-15) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-20 at e2d9677b20)
 + worktree prune: improve prune logic when worktree is moved
 + worktree: delete dead code
 + gc.txt: more details about what gc does

 The way "git worktree prune" worked internally has been simplified,
 by assuming how "git worktree move" moves an existing worktree to a
 different place.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* pw/add-p-select (2018-03-16) 3 commits
 - add -p: optimize line selection for short hunks
 - add -p: allow line selection to be inverted
 - add -p: select individual hunk lines

 "git add -p" interactive interface learned to let users choose
 individual added/removed lines to be used in the operation, instead
 of accepting or rejecting a whole hunk.


* ld/p4-unshelve (2018-02-22) 1 commit
 - git-p4: add unshelve command

 "git p4" learned to "unshelve" shelved commit from P4.

 Will hold, perhaps drop and use format-change that uses a proper "diff".

* ps/contains-id-error-message (2018-03-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-22 at 3bb1dcd506)
 + parse-options: do not show usage upon invalid option value

 "git tag --contains no-such-commit" gave a full list of options
 after giving an error message.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* nd/remove-ignore-env-field (2018-03-23) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-23 at ba9d0f2565)

  (merged to 'next' on 2018-03-15 at 802b6ea1cb)
 + repository: delete ignore_env member
 + sha1_file.c: move delayed getenv(altdb) back to setup_git_env()
 + repository.c: delete dead functions
 + repository.c: move env-related setup code back to environment.c
 + repository: initialize the_repository in main()
 (this branch is used by sb/object-store and sb/packfiles-in-repository.)

 Code clean-up for the "repository" abstraction.

 Will cook in 'next'.

 Rerolled by Duy on top of a separate preliminary clean-up topic.
 The resulting structure of the topics looked very sensible.

 Waiting for a follow-up discussion.

 + directory rename detection: partially renamed directory testcase/discussion
 + directory rename detection: testcases to avoid taking detection too far
 + directory rename detection: directory splitting testcases
 + directory rename detection: basic testcases

 Rename detection logic in "diff" family that is used in "merge" has
 learned to guess when all of x/a, x/b and x/c have moved to z/a,
 z/b and z/c, it is likely that x/d added in the meantime would also
 want to move to z/d by taking the hint that the entire directory
 'x' moved to 'z'.  A bug causing dirty files involved in a rename
 to be overwritten during merge has also been fixed as part of this
 work.

 Will cook in 'next'.
