Subject: What's cooking in git.git (Apr 2020, #04; Thu, 30)
X-master-at: d61d20c9b413225793f8a0b491bbbec61c184e26

What's cooking in git.git (Apr 2020, #04; Thu, 30)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

Quite a few topics have been merged to 'next' and also to 'master'.
There are a few more important topics that need to be merged down to
'master' before we're comfortable cutting the next maintenance
update but hopefully we'd get there during this week.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

 "git merge" learns the "--autostash" option.

 Will merge to 'master' together with the "rebase --quit" fix.


* dl/merge-autostash-rebase-quit-fix (2020-04-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-28 at 24dcf3edc1)
 + rebase: save autostash entry into stash reflog on --quit
 (this branch uses dl/merge-autostash.)

 The stash entry created by "git rebase --autosquash" to keep the
 initial dirty state were discarded by mistake upon "git rebase
 --quit", which has been corrected.


* en/fill-directory-exponential (2020-04-01) 12 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-22 at e2577e3dc9)

 + t7063: more thorough status checking

 The directory traversal code had redundant recursive calls which
 made its performance characteristics exponential with respect to
 the depth of the tree, which was corrected.


* en/sparse-checkout (2020-03-27) 18 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-15 at 3e295e445d)
 + sparse-checkout: provide a new reapply subcommand

* ps/transactional-update-ref-stdin (2020-04-02) 9 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-22 at 5c92add109)

 + git-update-ref.txt: add missing word
 + refs: fix segfault when aborting empty transaction

 "git update-ref --stdin" learned a handful of new verbs to let the
 user control ref update transactions more explicitly, which helps
 as an ingredient to implement two-phase commit-style atomic
 ref-updates across multiple repositories.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* cb/credential-store-warn-bogus-lines (2020-04-28) 2 commits
 - credential-store: warn instead of fatal for bogus lines from store
 - credential-store: document the file format a bit more

 With the recent tightening of the code that is used to parse
 various parts of a URL for use in the credential subsystem, a
 hand-edited credential-store file causes the credential helper to
 die, which is a bit too harsh to the users.  Demote the error
 behaviour to only warn and keep using well-formed lines instead.


* dl/switch-c-option-in-error-message (2020-04-30) 1 commit
 - switch: fix errors and comments related to -c and -C

 In error messages that "git switch" mentions its option to create a
 new branch, "-b/-B" options were shown, where "-c/-C" options
 should be, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* es/bugreport-with-hooks (2020-04-30) 2 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - bugreport: collect list of populated hooks
 (this branch uses es/bugreport.)

 (this branch uses tb/reset-shallow.)

 Code cleanup.

 Will merge to 'next'.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2018-10-15) 1 commit
 - zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-28 at 9510639ae8)
 + shallow.c: use '{commit,rollback}_shallow_file'
 + t5537: use test_write_lines and indented heredocs for readability
 (this branch is used by tb/shallow-cleanup.)

 Fix in-core inconsistency after fetching into a shallow repository
 that broke the code to write out commit-graph.

 Will merge to 'master'.

  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-28 at 70c6eca470)
 + macOS/brew: let the build find gettext headers/libraries/msgfmt

 Recent update to Homebrew used by macOS folks breaks build by
 moving gettext library and necessary headers.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* tb/commit-graph-fd-exhaustion-fix (2020-04-24) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-28 at 6d5fd6bc49)
 + commit-graph: close descriptors after mmap
 + commit-graph.c: gracefully handle file descriptor exhaustion
 + t/test-lib.sh: make ULIMIT_FILE_DESCRIPTORS available to tests
 + commit-graph.c: don't use discarded graph_name in error
 (this branch is tangled with tb/commit-graph-split-strategy.)

 The multi-pack-index left mmapped file descriptors open when it
 does not have to.

 Will merge to 'master'.

  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-28 at 49539cf116)
 + push: anonymize URLs in error messages and warnings

 Error and verbose trace messages from "git push" did not redact
 credential material embedded in URLs.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* js/partial-urlmatch-2.17 (2020-04-29) 3 commits
 - credential: handle `credential.<partial-URL>.<key>` again
 - credential: optionally allow partial URLs in credential_from_url_gently()
 - credential: fix grammar
 (this branch is used by js/partial-urlmatch.)

 Recent updates broke parsing of "credential.<url>.<key>" where
 <url> is not a full URL (e.g. [credential "https://"] helper = ...)
 stopped working, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* js/partial-urlmatch (2020-04-29) 3 commits
 - Sync with js/partial-urlmatch-2.17
 - credential: handle `credential.<partial-URL>.<key>` again
 - credential: optionally allow partial URLs in credential_from_url_gently()
 (this branch uses js/partial-urlmatch-2.17.)

 The same as js/partial-urlmatch-2.17, built on more recent codebase
 to avoid unnecessary merge conflicts.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* eb/gitweb-more-trailers (2020-04-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-28 at 7b16ac0810)

  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-28 at 8ea4882905)
 + rebase: display an error if --root and --fork-point are both provided

 Incompatible options "--root" and "--fork-point" of "git rebase"
 have been marked and documented as being incompatible.

* jt/v2-fetch-nego-fix (2020-04-28) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-28 at c6f9ebf2f7)
 + fetch-pack: in protocol v2, reset in_vain upon ACK
 + fetch-pack: in protocol v2, in_vain only after ACK
 + fetch-pack: return enum from process_acks()

 The upload-pack protocol v2 gave up too early before finding a
 common ancestor, resulting in a wasteful fetch from a fork of a
 project.  This has been corrected to match the behaviour of v0
 protocol.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* mt/doc-worktree-ref (2020-04-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-04-28 at d96c05cb0a)

 + t0000: disable GIT_TEST_FAIL_PREREQS in sub-tests

 Test update.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* dr/push-remoteref-fix (2020-04-23) 1 commit
 - remote.c: fix handling of %(push:remoteref)

 The "%(push:remoteref)" placeholder in the "--format=" argument of
 "git format-patch" (and friends) only showed what got explicitly
 configured, not what ref at the receiving end would be updated when
 "git push" was used, as it ignored the default behaviour (e.g. update
 the same ref as the source).

 Expecting a reroll.
 cf. <20200416152145.wp2zeibxmuyas6y6@feanor>


* dl/test-must-fail-fixes-4 (2020-04-20) 7 commits

* jc/credential-store-file-format-doc (2020-04-27) 1 commit
 . credential-store: document the file format a bit more

 Now has become a part of Carlo's credential-store fix patches.
