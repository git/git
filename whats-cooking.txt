What's cooking in git.git (Jan 2015, #04; Wed, 21)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.

First release candidate 2.3-rc1 has been tagged.  Please spend some
time to find and fix regressions, instead of spending all time
having fun with new and shiny toys ;-)

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* jk/http-push-symref-fix (2015-01-14) 1 commit
 + http-push: trim trailing newline from remote symref

 Using newer libCURL (or old one with security fixes) exposes this
 old breakage.

 - t/lib-httpd: switch SANITY check for NOT_ROOT

 Saw Torsten's report on Cygwin, but I couldn't tell if it was about
 existing breakages or new one introduced by this series.

 (this branch uses mh/reflog-expire and sb/atomic-push.)

 I had to wiggle this in and am not confident I did it correctly.

 Need extra set of eyes to review this.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* jn/doc-api-errors (2014-12-04) 1 commit
 - doc: document error handling functions and conventions

 For discussion.


* ye/http-accept-language (2015-01-21) 1 commit
 . http: add Accept-Language header if possible

 Not quite there yet.


* pw/remote-set-url-fetch (2014-11-26) 1 commit
 - remote: add --fetch and --both options to set-url

 Expecting a reroll.


* ms/submodule-update-config-doc (2014-11-03) 1 commit
 - submodule: clarify documentation for update subcommand

 Needs a reroll ($gmane/259037).


* je/quiltimport-no-fuzz (2014-10-21) 2 commits
 - git-quiltimport: flip the default not to allow fuzz
 - git-quiltimport.sh: allow declining fuzz with --exact option

 "quiltimport" drove "git apply" always with -C1 option to reduce
 context of the patch in order to give more chance to somewhat stale
 patches to apply.  Add an "--exact" option to disable, and also
 "-C$n" option to customize this behaviour.  The top patch
 optionally flips the default to "--exact".

 Tired of waiting for an Ack; will discard.


* tr/remerge-diff (2014-11-10) 9 commits
 - t4213: avoid "|" in sed regexp
 - log --remerge-diff: show what the conflict resolution changed
 - name-hash: allow dir hashing even when !ignore_case
 - merge-recursive: allow storing conflict hunks in index
 - merge_diff_mode: fold all merge diff variants into an enum
 - combine-diff: do not pass revs->dense_combined_merges redundantly
 - merge-recursive: -Xindex-only to leave worktree unchanged
 - merge-recursive: internal flag to avoid touching the worktree
 - merge-recursive: remove dead conditional in update_stages()

 "log -p" output learns a new way to let users inspect a merge
 commit by showing the differences between the automerged result
 with conflicts the person who recorded the merge would have seen
 and the final conflict resolution that was recorded in the merge.

 Waiting for a reroll ($gmane/256591).


* hv/submodule-config (2014-11-11) 4 commits
 - do not die on error of parsing fetchrecursesubmodules option
 - use new config API for worktree configurations of submodules
 - extract functions for submodule config set and lookup
 - implement submodule config cache for lookup of submodule names

 Kicked back to 'pu' per request ($gmane/255610).


* ab/add-interactive-show-diff-func-name (2014-05-12) 2 commits
 - SQUASH??? git-add--interactive: Preserve diff heading when splitting hunks
 - git-add--interactive: Preserve diff heading when splitting hunks

 Waiting for a reroll.


* jn/gitweb-utf8-in-links (2014-05-27) 1 commit
 - gitweb: Harden UTF-8 handling in generated links

 $gmane/250758?


* ss/userdiff-update-csharp-java (2014-06-02) 2 commits
 - userdiff: support Java try keyword
 - userdiff: support C# async methods and correct C# keywords

 Reviews sent; waiting for a response.


* bg/rebase-off-of-previous-branch (2014-04-16) 1 commit
 - git-rebase: print name of rev when using shorthand

 Teach "git rebase -" to report the concrete name of the branch
 (i.e. the previous one).

 But it stops short and does not do the same for "git rebase @{-1}".
 Expecting a reroll.


* rb/merge-prepare-commit-msg-hook (2014-01-10) 4 commits
 - merge: drop unused arg from abort_commit method signature
 - merge: make prepare_to_commit responsible for write_merge_state
 - t7505: ensure cleanup after hook blocks merge
 - t7505: add missing &&

 Expose more merge states (e.g. $GIT_DIR/MERGE_MODE) to hooks that
 run during "git merge".  The log message stresses too much on one
 hook, prepare-commit-msg, but it would equally apply to other hooks
 like post-merge, I think.

 Waiting for a reroll.


* jc/graph-post-root-gap (2013-12-30) 3 commits
 - WIP: document what we want at the end
 - graph: remove unused code a bit
 - graph: stuff the current commit into graph->columns[]

 This was primarily a RFH ($gmane/239580).


* tg/perf-lib-test-perf-cleanup (2013-09-19) 2 commits
 - perf-lib: add test_perf_cleanup target
 - perf-lib: split starting the test from the execution

 Add test_perf_cleanup shell function to the perf suite, that allows
 the script writers to define a test with a clean-up action.

 Will hold.


* jc/show-branch (2014-03-24) 5 commits
 - show-branch: use commit slab to represent bitflags of arbitrary width
 - show-branch.c: remove "all_mask"
 - show-branch.c: abstract out "flags" operation
 - show-branch.c: lift all_mask/all_revs to a global static
 - show-branch.c: update comment style

 Waiting for the final step to lift the hard-limit before sending it out.

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* jk/strbuf-doc-to-header (2015-01-16) 7 commits
 - strbuf.h: group documentation for trim functions
 - strbuf.h: drop boilerplate descriptions of strbuf_split_*

 - standardize usage info string format

 Will merge to and cook in 'next'.


* ak/cat-file-clean-up (2015-01-13) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-01-15 at bb1a4b3)
 + cat-file: use "type" and "size" from outer scope

 + t1050-large: generate large files without dd

 Will merge to 'master'.


* bc/http-fallback-to-password-after-krb-fails (2015-01-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-01-12 at 4c67038)
 + remote-curl: fall back to Basic auth if Negotiate fails

 After attempting and failing a password-less authentication
 (e.g. kerberos), libcURL refuses to fall back to password based
 Basic authentication without a bit of help/encouragement.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* bp/diff-relative-config (2015-01-07) 2 commits
 - diff: teach diff.relative to give default to --relative=<value>
 - diff: teach --no-relative to override earlier --relative

  (merged to 'next' on 2015-01-12 at 6b4605b)
 + format-patch: ignore diff.submodule setting
 + t4255: test am submodule with diff.submodule

 Setting diff.submodule to 'log' made "git format-patch" produce
 broken patches.

 Will cook in 'next'.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* km/gettext-n (2015-01-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-01-12 at 0cbbf4a)
 + gettext.h: add parentheses around N_ expansion if supported

 Will cook in 'next'.


* jn/rerere-fail-on-auto-update-failure (2015-01-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-01-12 at 313c449)
 + rerere: error out on autoupdate failure

 "git rerere" (invoked internally from many mergy operations) did
 not correctly signal errors when told to update the working tree
 files and failed to do so for whatever reason.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* sb/atomic-push (2015-01-14) 11 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-01-14 at 12c4e28)

 + receive-pack.c: shorten the execute_commands loop over all commands
 (this branch is used by sb/atomic-push-fix; uses mh/reflog-expire.)

 "git push" has been taught a "--atomic" option that makes push to
 update more than one ref an "all-or-none" affair.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* mh/reflog-expire (2014-12-22) 24 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-01-12 at 12a7dff)

 + refs.c: make ref_transaction_create a wrapper for ref_transaction_update
 (this branch is used by sb/atomic-push and sb/atomic-push-fix.)

 Restructure "reflog expire" to fit the reflogs better with the
 recently updated ref API.

 Looked reasonable (except that some shortlog entries stood out like
 a sore thumb).

 Will cook in 'next'.


* jc/push-to-checkout (2015-01-08) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-01-12 at e64df63)
 + receive-pack: support push-to-checkout hook
 + receive-pack: refactor updateInstead codepath

 Extending the js/push-to-deploy topic, the behaviour of "git push"
 when updating the working tree and the index with an update to the
 branch that is checked out can be tweaked by push-to-checkout hook.

 Will cook in 'next'.

[Discarded]

* jc/push-cert-hmac-optim (2014-09-25) 2 commits
 . receive-pack: truncate hmac early and convert only necessary bytes
 . sha1_to_hex: split out "hex-format n bytes" helper and use it

 This is "we could do this if we wanted to", not "we measured and it
 improves performance critical codepath".


* mt/patch-id-stable (2014-06-10) 1 commit
 . patch-id: change default to stable

 Nobody seems to be jumping up & down requesting this last step,
 which makes the result somewhat backward incompatible.


* sb/copy-fd-errno (2014-11-17) 1 commit
 . copy.c: make copy_fd preserve meaningful errno


* cj/grep-none-match (2015-01-06) 1 commit

 "git log --none-match --grep=WIP" will show only commits that are
 not marked as WIP.

 cj/log-invert-grep replaces this.
