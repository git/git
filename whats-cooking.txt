What's cooking in git.git (Jun 2023, #08; Fri, 30)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and
aren't considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL
to a message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity (of course they can be resubmit when new interests
arise).

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/

* ds/remove-idx-before-pack (2023-06-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2023-06-23 at fa97bf0e41)
 + packfile: delete .idx files before .pack files

 We create .pack and then .idx, we consider only packfiles that have
 .idx usable (those with only .pack are not ready yet), so we should
 remove .idx before removing .pack for consistency.

 setting pull.rebase=true, but these days pull.rebase=merges may be
 more inline with the original spirit of "rebuild your side on top

 - sequencer: beautify subject of reverts of reverts

 Instead of "Revert "Revert "original"", give "Reapply "original""
 as the title for a revert of a revert.

 Expecting a hopefully final reroll.
 Looking much better, except for minor cosmetic issues.
