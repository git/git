What's cooking in git.git (Mar 2024, #08; Tue, 26)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and
aren't considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL
to a message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity (of course they can be resubmit when new interests
arise).

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

 files left, which has been corrected.

 The conditional inclusion mechanism for configuration files learned
 to switch on the hostname.

 - transport-helper: send "true" value for object-format option

 The implementation and documentation of "object-format" option
 exchange between the Git itself and its remote helpers did not
 quite match.

 - SQUASH???
 - fuzz: link fuzz programs with `make all` on Linux
 - ci: also define CXX environment variable

 In addition to building the objects needed, try to link the objects
 that are used in fuzzer tests, to make sure at least they build
 without bitrot, in Linux CI runs.

 Comments?

 - Merge branch 'js/unit-test-suite-runner' into js/cmake-with-test-tool
 (this branch uses js/unit-test-suite-runner.)

 "test-tool" is now built in CMake build to also run the unit tests.

 May want to roll it into the base topic.

* js/unit-test-suite-runner (2024-02-23) 8 commits
 - ci: use test-tool as unit test runner on Windows
