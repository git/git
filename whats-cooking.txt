What's cooking in git.git (Aug 2016, #05; Fri, 12)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

v2.9.3 has been tagged as the third maintenance release for 2.9
series.  I am planning to tag v2.10-rc0 preview this weekend.  As
the topics that are still in-flight (either in 'pu' or still
outside) are mostly multi-patch series that can have large impact,
I think it is safe to say that they are not likely to be in the
upcoming 2.10 but some of them may hit 'next' during the pre-release
feature freeze.  We'll see.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

[Graduated to "master"]

* ew/http-backend-batch-headers (2016-08-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-08-11 at 93476b4)
 + http-backend: buffer headers before sending

 The http-backend (the server-side component of smart-http
 transport) used to trickle the HTTP header one at a time.  Now
 these write(2)s are batched.


* jk/big-and-future-archive-tar (2016-08-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-08-11 at 0abbd07)
 + archive-tar: make write_extended_header() void

 A small code clean-up.


* jk/trace-fixup (2016-08-05) 8 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-08-11 at 56f7621)
 + trace: do not fall back to stderr
 + write_or_die: drop write_or_whine_pipe()
 + trace: disable key after write error
 + trace: correct variable name in write() error message
 + trace: cosmetic fixes for error messages
 + trace: use warning() for printing trace errors
 + trace: stop using write_or_whine_pipe()
 + trace: handle NULL argument in trace_disable()

 Various small fixups to the "GIT_TRACE" facility.


* js/import-tars-hardlinks (2016-08-03) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-08-11 at 034230e)
 + import-tars: support hard links

 "import-tars" fast-import script (in contrib/) used to ignore a
 hardlink target and replaced it with an empty file, which has been
 corrected to record the same blob as the other file the hardlink is
 shared with.


* js/mv-dir-to-new-directory (2016-08-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-08-11 at c806ba2)
 + git mv: do not keep slash in `git mv dir non-existing-dir/`

 "git mv dir non-existing-dir/" did not work in some environments
 the same way as existing mainstream platforms.  The code now moves
 "dir" to "non-existing-dir", without relying on rename("A", "B/")
 that strips the trailing slash of '/'.


* kw/patch-ids-optim (2016-08-11) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-08-11 at f3ba3d0)
 + rebase: avoid computing unnecessary patch IDs
 + patch-ids: add flag to create the diff patch id using header only data
 + patch-ids: replace the seen indicator with a commit pointer
 + patch-ids: stop using a hand-rolled hashmap implementation

 When "git rebase" tries to compare set of changes on the updated
 upstream and our own branch, it computes patch-id for all of these
 changes and attempts to find matches. This has been optimized by
 lazily computing the full patch-id (which is expensive) to be
 compared only for changes that touch the same set of paths.


* ms/document-pack-window-memory-is-per-thread (2016-08-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-08-11 at 228e96d)
 + document git-repack interaction of pack.threads and pack.windowMemory


* rs/child-process-init (2016-08-05) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-08-11 at 860857b)
 + use CHILD_PROCESS_INIT to initialize automatic variables

 A small code clean-up.


* rs/merge-add-strategies-simplification (2016-08-05) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-08-11 at 6b8dfc1)
 + merge: use string_list_split() in add_strategies()

 A small code clean-up.


* rs/merge-recursive-string-list-init (2016-08-05) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-08-11 at 37e62ba)
 + merge-recursive: use STRING_LIST_INIT_NODUP

 A small code clean-up.


* rs/use-strbuf-add-unique-abbrev (2016-08-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-08-11 at 81ac5ff)
 + use strbuf_add_unique_abbrev() for adding short hashes

 A small code clean-up.


* sb/submodule-clone-retry (2016-08-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-08-11 at 4600b20)
 + submodule--helper: use parallel processor correctly

 Fix-up to an error codepath in a topic already in 'master'.


* va/i18n (2016-08-10) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-08-11 at d6e1422)
 + i18n: git-stash: mark messages for translation

* vs/typofix (2016-08-11) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-08-11 at 435c418)
 + Spelling fixes

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* tb/t0027-raciness-fix (2016-08-12) 2 commits
 - convert: missing `LF will be replaced by CRLF
 - t0027: Correct raciness in NNO test

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* jc/bundle (2016-03-03) 6 commits
 - index-pack: --clone-bundle option
 - Merge branch 'jc/index-pack' into jc/bundle
 - bundle v3: the beginning
 - bundle: keep a copy of bundle file name in the in-core bundle header
 - bundle: plug resource leak
 - bundle doc: 'verify' is not about verifying the bundle

 The beginning of "split bundle", which could be one of the
 ingredients to allow "git clone" traffic off of the core server
 network to CDN.

 While I think it would make it easier for people to experiment and
 build on if the topic is merged to 'next', I am at the same time a
 bit reluctant to merge an unproven new topic that introduces a new
 file format, which we may end up having to support til the end of
 time.  It is likely that to support a "prime clone from CDN", it
 would need a lot more than just "these are the heads and the pack
 data is over there", so this may not be sufficient.

 Will discard.


* jc/blame-reverse (2016-06-14) 2 commits
 - blame: dwim "blame --reverse OLD" as "blame --reverse OLD.."
 - blame: improve diagnosis for "--reverse NEW"

 It is a common mistake to say "git blame --reverse OLD path",
 expecting that the command line is dwimmed as if asking how lines
 in path in an old revision OLD have survived up to the current
 commit.

 Has been waiting for positive responses without seeing any.

 Will discard.


* dt/index-helper (2016-07-06) 21 commits
 - index-helper: indexhelper.exitAfter config
 - trace: measure where the time is spent in the index-heavy operations
 - index-helper: optionally automatically run
 - index-helper: autorun mode
 - index-helper: don't run if already running
 - index-helper: kill mode
 - watchman: add a config option to enable the extension
 - unpack-trees: preserve index extensions
 - update-index: enable/disable watchman support
 - index-helper: use watchman to avoid refreshing index with lstat()
 - watchman: support watchman to reduce index refresh cost
 - read-cache: add watchman 'WAMA' extension
 - index-helper: log warnings
 - index-helper: add --detach
 - daemonize(): set a flag before exiting the main process
 - index-helper: add --strict
 - index-helper: new daemon for caching index and related stuff
 - unix-socket.c: add stub implementation when unix sockets are not supported
 - pkt-line: add gentle version of packet_write
 - read-cache: allow to keep mmap'd memory after reading
 - read-cache.c: fix constness of verify_hdr()

 A new "index-helper" daemon has been introduced to give newly
 spawned Git process a quicker access to the data in the index, and
 optionally interface with the watchman daemon to further reduce the
 refresh cost.

 Not quite ready yet, it seems.

* po/range-doc (2016-07-20) 8 commits
 - doc: revisions - clarify reachability examples
 - doc: revisions - define `reachable`
 - doc: gitrevisions - clarify 'latter case' is revision walk
 - doc: gitrevisions - use 'reachable' in page description
 - doc: give headings for the two and three dot notations
 - doc: show the actual left, right, and boundary marks
 - doc: revisions - name the left and right sides
 - doc: use 'symmetric difference' consistently

 Clarify various ways to specify the "revision ranges" in the
 documentation.

 Updates in 4/8 ("give headings") is reported to break formatting?

* jc/attr (2016-05-25) 18 commits
 - attr: support quoting pathname patterns in C style
 - attr: expose validity check for attribute names
 - attr: add counted string version of git_attr()
 - attr: add counted string version of git_check_attr()
 - attr: retire git_check_attrs() API
 - attr: convert git_check_attrs() callers to use the new API
 - attr: convert git_all_attrs() to use "struct git_attr_check"
 - attr: (re)introduce git_check_attr() and struct git_attr_check
 - attr: rename function and struct related to checking attributes
 - attr.c: plug small leak in parse_attr_line()
 - attr.c: tighten constness around "git_attr" structure
 - attr.c: simplify macroexpand_one()
 - attr.c: mark where #if DEBUG ends more clearly
 - attr.c: complete a sentence in a comment
 - attr.c: explain the lack of attr-name syntax check in parse_attr()
 - attr.c: update a stale comment on "struct match_attr"
 - attr.c: use strchrnul() to scan for one line
 - commit.c: use strchrnul() to scan for one line
 (this branch is used by jc/attr-more, sb/pathspec-label and sb/submodule-default-paths.)

 The attributes API has been updated so that it can later be
 optimized using the knowledge of which attributes are queried.

 I wanted to polish this topic further to make the attribute
 subsystem thread-ready, but because other topics depend on this
 topic and they do not (yet) need it to be thread-ready.

 As the authors of topics that depend on this seem not in a hurry,
 let's discard this and dependent topics and restart them some other
 day.

 Will discard.


* jc/attr-more (2016-06-09) 8 commits
 - attr.c: outline the future plans by heavily commenting
 - attr.c: always pass check[] to collect_some_attrs()
 - attr.c: introduce empty_attr_check_elems()
 - attr.c: correct ugly hack for git_all_attrs()
 - attr.c: rename a local variable check
 - fixup! d5ad6c13
 - attr.c: pass struct git_attr_check down the callchain
 - attr.c: add push_stack() helper
 (this branch uses jc/attr; is tangled with sb/pathspec-label and sb/submodule-default-paths.)

 The beginning of long and tortuous journey to clean-up attribute
 subsystem implementation.

 Needs to be redone.
 Will discard.


* sb/submodule-default-paths (2016-06-20) 5 commits
 - completion: clone can recurse into submodules
 - clone: add --init-submodule=<pathspec> switch
 - submodule update: add `--init-default-path` switch
 - Merge branch 'sb/pathspec-label' into sb/submodule-default-paths
 - Merge branch 'jc/attr' into sb/submodule-default-paths
 (this branch uses jc/attr and sb/pathspec-label; is tangled with jc/attr-more.)

 Allow specifying the set of submodules the user is interested in on
 the command line of "git clone" that clones the superproject.

 Will discard.


* sb/pathspec-label (2016-06-03) 6 commits
 - pathspec: disable preload-index when attribute pathspec magic is in use
 - pathspec: allow escaped query values
 - pathspec: allow querying for attributes
 - pathspec: move prefix check out of the inner loop
 - pathspec: move long magic parsing out of prefix_pathspec
 - Documentation: fix a typo
 (this branch is used by sb/submodule-default-paths; uses jc/attr; is tangled with jc/attr-more.)

 The pathspec mechanism learned ":(attr:X)$pattern" pathspec magic
 to limit paths that match $pattern further by attribute settings.
 The preload-index mechanism is disabled when the new pathspec magic
 is in use (at least for now), because the attribute subsystem is
 not thread-ready.

 Will discard.


* mh/connect (2016-06-06) 10 commits
 - connect: [host:port] is legacy for ssh
 - connect: move ssh command line preparation to a separate function
 - connect: actively reject git:// urls with a user part
 - connect: change the --diag-url output to separate user and host
 - connect: make parse_connect_url() return the user part of the url as a separate value
 - connect: group CONNECT_DIAG_URL handling code
 - connect: make parse_connect_url() return separated host and port
 - connect: re-derive a host:port string from the separate host and port variables
 - connect: call get_host_and_port() earlier
 - connect: document why we sometimes call get_port after get_host_and_port

 Rewrite Git-URL parsing routine (hopefully) without changing any
 behaviour.

 It has been two months without any support.  We may want to discard
 this.


* sb/bisect (2016-04-15) 22 commits
 . SQUASH???
 . bisect: get back halfway shortcut
 . bisect: compute best bisection in compute_relevant_weights()
 . bisect: use a bottom-up traversal to find relevant weights
 . bisect: prepare for different algorithms based on find_all
 . bisect: rename count_distance() to compute_weight()
 . bisect: make total number of commits global
 . bisect: introduce distance_direction()
 . bisect: extract get_distance() function from code duplication
 . bisect: use commit instead of commit list as arguments when appropriate
 . bisect: replace clear_distance() by unique markers

 . t: use test_cmp_rev() where appropriate
 . t/test-lib-functions.sh: generalize test_cmp_rev
 . bisect: allow 'bisect run' if no good commit is known
 . bisect: write about `bisect next` in documentation

 The internal algorithm used in "git bisect" to find the next commit
 to check has been optimized greatly.

 Was expecting a reroll, but now pb/bisect topic starts removinging
 more and more parts from git-bisect.sh, this needs to see a fresh
 reroll.

 Will discard.

* ec/annotate-deleted (2015-11-20) 1 commit
 - annotate: skip checking working tree if a revision is provided

 Usability fix for annotate-specific "<file> <rev>" syntax with deleted
 files.

 Has been waiting for a review for too long without seeing anything.

 Will discard.


* dk/gc-more-wo-pack (2016-01-13) 4 commits
 - gc: clean garbage .bitmap files from pack dir
 - t5304: ensure non-garbage files are not deleted
 - t5304: test .bitmap garbage files

 Follow-on to dk/gc-idx-wo-pack topic, to clean up stale
 .bitmap and .keep files.

 Has been waiting for a reroll for too long.

 Will discard.


* jc/diff-b-m (2015-02-23) 5 commits
 . WIPWIP
 . WIP: diff-b-m
 - diffcore-rename: allow easier debugging
 - diffcore-rename.c: add locate_rename_src()
 - diffcore-break: allow debugging

 "git diff -B -M" produced incorrect patch when the postimage of a
 completely rewritten file is similar to the preimage of a removed
 file; such a resulting file must not be expressed as a rename from
 other place.

 The fix in this patch is broken, unfortunately.

 Will discard.

* jk/diff-submodule-diff-inline (2016-08-11) 5 commits
 - SQUASH??? clarify the if/{if/else} nesting
 - SQUASH???
 - diff: add SUBMODULE_DIFF format to display submodule diff
 - diff: add --line-prefix option for passing in a prefix
 - diff.c: remove output_prefix_length field

 The "git diff --submodule={short,log}" mechanism has been enhanced
 to allow "--submodule=diff" to show the patch between the submodule
 commits bound to the superproject.


* jk/reduce-gc-aggressive-depth (2016-08-11) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-08-11 at 6810c6f)
 + gc: default aggressive depth to 50

 "git gc --aggressive" used to limit the delta-chain length to 250,
 which is way too deep for gaining additional space savings and is
 detrimental for runtime performance.  The limit has been reduced to
 50.

 Will hold to see if people scream.


* ks/pack-objects-bitmap (2016-08-09) 2 commits

 - status: cleanup API to wt_status_print
 - status: rename long-format print routines

 Enhance "git status --porcelain" output by collecting more data on
 the state of the index and the working tree files, which may
 further be used to teach git-prompt (in contrib/) to make fewer
 calls to git.

 Waiting for review discussion to settle.


* mh/diff-indent-heuristic (2016-08-04) 8 commits
 - diff: improve positioning of add/delete blocks in diffs
 - is_blank_line: take a single xrecord_t as argument
 - xdl_change_compact(): keep track of the earliest end
 - xdl_change_compact(): fix compaction heuristic to adjust io
 - xdl_change_compact(): do one final shift or the other, not both
 - xdl_change_compact(): rename i to end
 - xdl_change_compact(): clarify code
 - xdl_change_compact(): rename some local variables for clarity

 Output from "git diff" can be made easier to read by selecting
 which lines are common and which lines are added/deleted
 intelligently when the lines before and after the changed section
 are the same.  A command line option is added to help with the
 experiment to find a good heuristics.

* jk/pack-objects-optim-mru (2016-08-11) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-08-11 at c0a7dae)
 + pack-objects: use mru list when iterating over packs
 + pack-objects: break delta cycles before delta-search phase
 + sha1_file: make packed_object_info public
 + provide an initializer for "struct object_info"

 "git pack-objects" in a repository with many packfiles used to
 spend a lot of time looking for/at objects in them; the accesses to
 the packfiles are now optimized by checking the most-recently-used
 packfile first.

 Will hold to see if people scream.


* jk/rebase-i-drop-ident-check (2016-07-29) 1 commit
 - rebase-interactive: drop early check for valid ident

 Even when "git pull --rebase=preserve" (and the underlying "git
 rebase --preserve") can complete without creating any new commit
 (i.e. fast-forwards), it still insisted on having a usable ident
 information (read: user.email is set correctly), which was less
 than nice.  As the underlying commands used inside "git rebase"
 would fail with a more meaningful error message and advice text
 when the bogus ident matters, this extra check was removed.

 Will hold.

* dp/autoconf-curl-ssl (2016-06-28) 1 commit
 - ./configure.ac: detect SSL in libcurl using curl-config

 The ./configure script generated from configure.ac was taught how
 to detect support of SSL by libcurl better.

 Needs review.


* jc/pull-rebase-ff (2016-07-28) 1 commit
 - pull: fast-forward "pull --rebase=true"

 "git pull --rebase", when there is no new commits on our side since
 we forked from the upstream, should be able to fast-forward without
 invoking "git rebase", but it didn't.

 Needs a real log message and a few tests.

 + pathspec: warn on empty strings as pathspec

 An empty string used as a pathspec element has always meant
 'everything matches', but it is too easy to write a script that
 finds a path to remove in $path and run 'git rm "$paht"', which
 ends up removing everything.  Start warning about this use of an
 empty string used for 'everything matches' and ask users to use a
 more explicit '.' for that instead.

 The hope is that existing users will not mind this change, and
 eventually the warning can be turned into a hard error, upgrading
 the deprecation into removal of this (mis)feature.

 Will hold to see if people scream.

* nd/shallow-deepen (2016-06-13) 27 commits
 - fetch, upload-pack: --deepen=N extends shallow boundary by N commits

 - shallow.c: implement a generic shallow boundary finder based on rev-list
 - fetch-pack: use a separate flag for fetch in deepening mode

 - remote-curl.c: convert fetch_git() to use argv_array

 The existing "git fetch --depth=<n>" option was hard to use
 correctly when making the history of an existing shallow clone
 deeper.  A new option, "--deepen=<n>", has been added to make this
 easier to use.  "git clone" also learned "--shallow-since=<date>"
 and "--shallow-exclude=<tag>" options to make it easier to specify
 "I am interested only in the recent N months worth of history" and
 "Give me only the history since that version".

 Needs review.

 Rerolled.  What this topic attempts to achieve is worthwhile, I
 would think.

 not quite yet.

* jc/merge-drop-old-syntax (2015-04-29) 1 commit
 - merge: drop 'git merge <message> HEAD <commit>' syntax

 Stop supporting "git merge <message> HEAD <commit>" syntax that has
 been deprecated since October 2007, and issues a deprecation
 warning message since v2.5.0.

 It has been reported that git-gui still uses the deprecated syntax,
 which needs to be fixed before this final step can proceed.
