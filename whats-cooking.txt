What's cooking in git.git (Aug 2018, #01; Thu, 2)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

Many topics have moved to 'master' and 'next' from 'next' to 'pu'
respectively.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

[Graduated to "master"]

* ab/checkout-default-remote (2018-06-11) 8 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-24 at 6ef645f485)
 + checkout & worktree: introduce checkout.defaultRemote
 + checkout: add advice for ambiguous "checkout <branch>"
 + builtin/checkout.c: use "ret" variable for return
 + checkout: pass the "num_matches" up to callers
 + checkout.c: change "unique" member to "num_matches"
 + checkout.c: introduce an *_INIT macro
 + checkout.h: wrap the arguments to unique_tracking_name()
 + checkout tests: index should be clean after dwim checkout
 (this branch is used by ab/test-must-be-empty.)

 "git checkout" and "git worktree add" learned to honor
 checkout.defaultRemote when auto-vivifying a local branch out of a
 remote tracking branch in a repository with multiple remotes that
 have tracking branches that share the same names.


* bc/object-id (2018-07-16) 16 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-24 at 23680778a9)
 + pretty: switch hard-coded constants to the_hash_algo
 + sha1-file: convert constants to uses of the_hash_algo
 + log-tree: switch GIT_SHA1_HEXSZ to the_hash_algo->hexsz
 + diff: switch GIT_SHA1_HEXSZ to use the_hash_algo
 + builtin/merge-recursive: make hash independent
 + builtin/merge: switch to use the_hash_algo
 + builtin/fmt-merge-msg: make hash independent
 + builtin/update-index: simplify parsing of cacheinfo
 + builtin/update-index: convert to using the_hash_algo
 + refs/files-backend: use the_hash_algo for writing refs
 + sha1-name: use the_hash_algo when parsing object names
 + strbuf: allocate space with GIT_MAX_HEXSZ
 + commit: express tree entry constants in terms of the_hash_algo
 + hex: switch to using the_hash_algo
 + tree-walk: replace hard-coded constants with the_hash_algo
 + cache: update object ID functions for the_hash_algo

 Conversion from uchar[40] to struct object_id continues.


* bc/sequencer-export-work-tree-as-well (2018-07-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-24 at 0b83ade721)
 + sequencer: pass absolute GIT_WORK_TREE to exec commands

 "git rebase" started exporting GIT_DIR environment variable and
 exposing it to hook scripts when part of it got rewritten in C.
 Instead of matching the old scripted Porcelains' behaviour,
 compensate by also exporting GIT_WORK_TREE environment as well to
 lessen the damage.  This can harm existing hooks that want to
 operate on different repository, but the current behaviour is
 already broken for them anyway.


* bp/test-drop-caches-for-windows (2018-07-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-24 at 257bb336c6)
 + handle lower case drive letters on Windows

 A test helper update for Windows.


* ds/commit-graph-fsck (2018-07-16) 23 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-24 at 6a802adc7a)
 + coccinelle: update commit.cocci
 + commit-graph: update design document
 + gc: automatically write commit-graph files
 + commit-graph: add '--reachable' option
 + commit-graph: use string-list API for input
 + fsck: verify commit-graph

 + commit-graph: test for corrupted octopus edge
 + commit-graph: verify commit date
 + commit-graph: verify generation number

 + commit-graph: verify corrupt OID fanout and lookup
 + commit-graph: verify required chunks are present
 + commit-graph: verify catches corrupt signature
 + commit-graph: add 'verify' subcommand
 + commit-graph: load a root tree from specific graph
 + commit: force commit to parse from object database
 + commit-graph: parse commit from chosen graph
 + commit-graph: fix GRAPH_MIN_SIZE
 + commit-graph: UNLEAK before die()
 + t5318-commit-graph.sh: use core.commitGraph
 (this branch is used by ds/commit-graph-with-grafts, ds/reachable and jt/commit-graph-per-object-store.)

 "git fsck" learns to make sure the optional commit-graph file is in
 a sane state.


* en/dirty-merge-fixes (2018-07-11) 9 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-24 at 7b6ca3507c)
 + merge: fix misleading pre-merge check documentation
 + merge-recursive: enforce rule that index matches head before merging
 + t6044: add more testcases with staged changes before a merge is invoked
 + merge-recursive: fix assumption that head tree being merged is HEAD
 + merge-recursive: make sure when we say we abort that we actually abort
 + t6044: add a testcase for index matching head, when head doesn't match HEAD
 + t6044: verify that merges expected to abort actually abort
 + index_has_changes(): avoid assuming operating on the_index
 + read-cache.c: move index_has_changes() from merge.c

 The recursive merge strategy did not properly ensure there was no
 change between HEAD and the index before performing its operation,
 which has been corrected.


* en/t6036-merge-recursive-tests (2018-07-11) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-24 at 75055cb6e1)
 + t6036: add a failed conflict detection case: regular files, different modes
 + t6036: add a failed conflict detection case with conflicting types
 + t6036: add a failed conflict detection case with submodule add/add
 + t6036: add a failed conflict detection case with submodule modify/modify
 + t6036: add a failed conflict detection case with symlink add/add
 + t6036: add a failed conflict detection case with symlink modify/modify

 Tests to cover various conflicting cases have been added for
 merge-recursive.


* en/t6036-recursive-corner-cases (2018-07-12) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-24 at b7b3514ef4)
 + t6036: fix broken && chain in sub-shell
 + t6036: add lots of detail for directory/file conflicts in recursive case

 Tests to cover more D/F conflict cases have been added for
 merge-recursive.


* en/t6042-insane-merge-rename-testcases (2018-07-03) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-24 at 65c80f72da)
 + t6042: add testcase covering long chains of rename conflicts
 + t6042: add testcase covering rename/rename(2to1)/delete/delete conflict
 + t6042: add testcase covering rename/add/delete conflict type

 Various glitches in the heuristics of merge-recursive strategy have
 been documented in new tests.

 I am not sure if there is a single "correct" answer everybody can
 agree on for each of these "insane" cases, though.


* en/t7405-recursive-submodule-conflicts (2018-07-11) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-24 at 6cb7d02298)
 + t7405: verify 'merge --abort' works after submodule/path conflicts
 + t7405: add a directory/submodule conflict
 + t7405: add a file/submodule conflict

 Tests to cover conflict cases that involve submodules have been
 added for merge-recursive.


* es/chain-lint-in-subshell (2018-07-31) 11 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-31 at 4ce2a8faa4)
 + t/chainlint.sed: drop extra spaces from regex character class
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-24 at 9370bbdfaf)
 + t/chainlint: add chainlint "specialized" test cases
 + t/chainlint: add chainlint "complex" test cases
 + t/chainlint: add chainlint "cuddled" test cases

 + t/chainlint: add chainlint "basic" test cases
 + t/Makefile: add machinery to check correctness of chainlint.sed
 + t/test-lib: teach --chain-lint to detect broken &&-chains in subshells
 (this branch uses es/test-fixes.)

 Look for broken "&&" chains that are hidden in subshell, many of
 which have been found and corrected.


* es/test-fixes (2018-07-17) 26 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-24 at fd6796a3ef)

 + t: drop unnecessary terminating semicolon in subshell
 + t: use sane_unset() rather than 'unset' with broken &&-chain
 + t: use test_write_lines() instead of series of 'echo' commands
 + t: use test_might_fail() instead of manipulating exit code manually
 (this branch is used by es/chain-lint-in-subshell.)

 Test clean-up and corrections.


* is/parsing-line-range (2018-06-15) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-24 at a06b453f32)
 + log: prevent error if line range ends past end of file
 + blame: prevent error if range ends past end of file

 Parsing of -L[<N>][,[<M>]] parameters "git blame" and "git log"
 take has been tweaked.


* jk/fsck-gitmodules-gently (2018-07-16) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-24 at 5b15c800db)
 + fsck: downgrade gitmodulesParse default to "info"
 + fsck: split ".gitmodules too large" error from parse failure
 + fsck: silence stderr when parsing .gitmodules
 + config: add options parameter to git_config_from_mem
 + config: add CONFIG_ERROR_SILENT handler
 + config: turn die_on_error into caller-facing enum

 Recent "security fix" to pay attention to contents of ".gitmodules"
 while accepting "git push" was a bit overly strict than necessary,
 which has been adjusted.


* jk/has-uncommitted-changes-fix (2018-07-11) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-24 at 2ea14c0afb)
 + has_uncommitted_changes(): fall back to empty tree

 "git pull --rebase" on a corrupt HEAD caused a segfault.  In
 general we substitute an empty tree object when running the in-core
 equivalent of the diff-index command, and the codepath has been
 corrected to do so as well to fix this issue.


* jm/cache-entry-from-mem-pool (2018-07-03) 8 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-24 at 9be51a88dc)
 + block alloc: add validations around cache_entry lifecyle
 + block alloc: allocate cache entries from mem_pool
 + mem-pool: fill out functionality
 + mem-pool: add life cycle management functions
 + mem-pool: only search head block for available space
 + block alloc: add lifecycle APIs for cache_entry structs
 + read-cache: teach make_cache_entry to take object_id
 + read-cache: teach refresh_cache_entry to take istate

 For a large tree, the index needs to hold many cache entries
 allocated on heap.  These cache entries are now allocated out of a
 dedicated memory pool to amortize malloc(3) overhead.

 This makes each cache-entry larger by either 4 or 8 bytes, which is
 a bit sad, though.


* jm/send-email-tls-auth-on-batch (2018-07-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-24 at fb3e653f44)
 + send-email: fix tls AUTH when sending batch

 "git send-email" when using in a batched mode that limits the
 number of messages sent in a single SMTP session lost the contents
 of the variable used to choose between tls/ssl, unable to send the
 second and later batches, which has been fixed.

 This is marked to be merged to 'next' already, but I do not mind
 getting an updated version with an improved log message before that
 happens.


* js/rebase-merge-octopus (2018-07-11) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-24 at 14ad8699de)
 + rebase --rebase-merges: adjust man page for octopus support
 + rebase --rebase-merges: add support for octopus merges
 + merge: allow reading the merge commit message from a file

 "git rebase --rebase-merges" mode now handles octopus merges as
 well.


* jt/commit-graph-per-object-store (2018-07-17) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-24 at 090d1a4d59)
 + commit-graph: add repo arg to graph readers
 + commit-graph: store graph in struct object_store
 + commit-graph: add free_commit_graph
 + commit-graph: add missing forward declaration
 + object-store: add missing include
 + commit-graph: refactor preparing commit graph
 + Merge branch 'ds/commit-graph-fsck' into jt/commit-graph-per-object-store
 (this branch is used by ds/commit-graph-with-grafts and ds/reachable; uses ds/commit-graph-fsck and sb/object-store-lookup.)

 The singleton commit-graph in-core instance is made per in-core
 repository instance.


* jt/fetch-nego-tip (2018-07-03) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-24 at a9e299006d)
 + fetch-pack: support negotiation tip whitelist
 (this branch is used by ab/fetch-nego; uses jt/fetch-pack-negotiator; is tangled with jt/fetch-negotiator-skipping.)

 "git fetch" learned a new option "--negotiation-tip" to limit the
 set of commits it tells the other end as "have", to reduce wasted
 bandwidth and cycles, which would be helpful when the receiving
 repository has a lot of refs that have little to do with the
 history at the remote it is fetching from.


* jt/fetch-negotiator-skipping (2018-07-16) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-24 at 8e25a49405)
 + negotiator/skipping: skip commits during fetch
 (this branch is used by ab/fetch-nego; uses jt/fetch-pack-negotiator; is tangled with jt/fetch-nego-tip.)

 Add a server-side knob to skip commits in exponential/fibbonacci
 stride in an attempt to cover wider swath of history with a smaller
 number of iterations, potentially accepting a larger packfile
 transfer, instead of going back one commit a time during common
 ancestor discovery during the "git fetch" transaction.


* jt/fetch-pack-negotiator (2018-06-15) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-24 at 438efcd6b1)
 + fetch-pack: introduce negotiator API
 + fetch-pack: move common check and marking together
 + fetch-pack: make negotiation-related vars local
 + fetch-pack: use ref adv. to prune "have" sent
 + fetch-pack: directly end negotiation if ACK ready
 + fetch-pack: clear marks before re-marking
 + fetch-pack: split up everything_local()
 (this branch is used by ab/fetch-nego, jt/fetch-nego-tip and jt/fetch-negotiator-skipping.)

 Code restructuring and a small fix to transport protocol v2 during
 fetching.


* jt/tags-to-promised-blobs-fix (2018-07-16) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-24 at 8d7e78a671)
 + tag: don't warn if target is missing but promised
 + revision: tolerate promised targets of tags

 The lazy clone support had a few places where missing but promised
 objects were not correctly tolerated, which have been fixed.


* kg/gc-auto-windows-workaround (2018-07-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-24 at 71c05d27b6)
 + gc --auto: release pack files before auto packing

 "git gc --auto" opens file descriptors for the packfiles before
 spawning "git repack/prune", which would upset Windows that does
 not want a process to work on a file that is open by another
 process.  The issue has been worked around.


* sb/diff-color-move-more (2018-07-19) 10 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-24 at 89c893cab2)
 + diff.c: offer config option to control ws handling in move detection
 + diff.c: add white space mode to move detection that allows indent changes
 + diff.c: factor advance_or_nullify out of mark_color_as_moved
 + diff.c: decouple white space treatment from move detection algorithm
 + diff.c: add a blocks mode for moved code detection
 + diff.c: adjust hash function signature to match hashmap expectation
 + diff.c: do not pass diff options as keydata to hashmap
 + t4015: avoid git as a pipe input
 + xdiff/xdiffi.c: remove unneeded function declarations
 + xdiff/xdiff.h: remove unused flags

 "git diff --color-moved" feature has further been tweaked.


* sb/object-store-lookup (2018-06-29) 33 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-24 at dd96e29376)
 + commit.c: allow lookup_commit_reference to handle arbitrary repositories

 + blob: add repository argument to lookup_blob
 + object: add repository argument to object_as_type
 + object: add repository argument to parse_object_buffer
 + object: add repository argument to lookup_object
 + object: add repository argument to parse_object
 + Merge branch 'sb/object-store-grafts' into sb/object-store-lookup
 (this branch is used by ds/commit-graph-with-grafts, ds/reachable and jt/commit-graph-per-object-store.)

 lookup_commit_reference() and friends have been updated to find
 in-core object for a specific in-core repository instance.


* sg/httpd-test-unflake (2018-07-12) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-24 at b7df820256)
 + t/lib-httpd: avoid occasional failures when checking access.log
 + t/lib-httpd: add the strip_access_log() helper function
 + t5541: clean up truncating access log

 httpd tests saw occasional breakage due to the way its access log
 gets inspected by the tests, which has been updated to make them
 less flaky.


* tb/grep-only-matching (2018-07-09) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-07-24 at 7e878b9d95)
 + grep.c: teach 'git grep --only-matching'
 + grep.c: extract show_line_header()

 "git grep" learned the "--only-matching" option.

[New Topics]

* ab/fsck-transfer-updates (2018-07-27) 10 commits
 - fsck: test and document unknown fsck.<msg-id> values
 - fsck: add stress tests for fsck.skipList
 - fsck: test & document {fetch,receive}.fsck.* config fallback
 - fetch: implement fetch.fsck.*
 - transfer.fsckObjects tests: untangle confusing setup

 - receive.fsck.<msg-id> tests: remove dead code

 The test performed at the receiving end of "git push" to prevent
 bad objects from entering repository can be customized via
 receive.fsck.* configuration variables; we now have gained a
 counterpart to do the same on the "git fetch" side, with
 fetch.fsck.* configuration variables.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 - sequencer: fix "rebase -i --root" corrupting author header timezone
 - sequencer: fix "rebase -i --root" corrupting author header
 (this branch is used by pw/rebase-i-author-script-fix.)

 The "author-script" file "git rebase -i" creates got broken when

 getting fixed now.

 Will merge to 'next'.

* ab/fetch-tags-noclobber (2018-07-31) 10 commits
 - fetch: stop clobbering existing tags without --force
 - pull doc: fix a long-standing grammar error
 - fetch tests: add a test clobbering tag behavior
 - fetch tests: correct a comment "remove it" -> "remove them"
 - push doc: correct lies about how push refspecs work
 - push tests: assert re-pushing annotated tags
 - push tests: add more testing for forced tag pushing
 - push tests: fix logic error in "push" test assertion
 - push tests: remove redundant 'git push' invocation
 - fetch tests: change "Tag" test tag to "testTag"

 "git fetch" used to apply the same "fast-forward" rule and allow
 tags to move without "--force" option, which made little sense,
 which has been corrected.

 Expecting a reroll.

* jt/refspec-dwim-precedence-fix (2018-08-02) 1 commit
 - remote: make refspec follow the same disambiguation rule as local refs

 "git fetch $there refs/heads/s" ought to fetch the tip of the
 branch 's', but when "refs/heads/refs/heads/s", i.e. a branch whose
 name is "refs/heads/s" exists at the same time, fetched that one
 instead by mistake.  This has been corrected to honor the usual
 disambiguation rules for abbreviated refnames.

 - clone: report duplicate entries on case-insensitive filesystems

 Running "git clone" against a project that contain two files with
 pathnames that differ only in cases on a case insensitive
 filesystem would result in one of the files lost because the
 underlying filesystem is incapable of holding both at the same
 time.  An attempt is made to detect such a case and warn.

 Discussion getting petered out.
 Doing this portably and extending it to UTF-8 normalization issue
 HFS+ has would be costly.

 - unpack-trees: cheaper index update when walking by cache-tree
 - unpack-trees: reduce malloc in cache-tree walk
 - unpack-trees: optimize walking same trees with cache-tree
 - unpack-trees.c: add performance tracing

 The unpack_trees() API used in checking out a branch and merging
 walks one or more trees along with the index.  When the cache-tree
 in the index tells us that we are walking a tree whose flattened
 contents is known (i.e. matches a span in the index), as linearly
 scanning a span in the index is much more efficient than having to
 open tree objects recursively and listing their entries, the walk
 can be optimized, which is done in this topic.

* en/merge-recursive-skip-fix (2018-07-27) 2 commits
 - merge-recursive: preserve skip_worktree bit when necessary
 - t3507: add a testcase showing failure with sparse checkout

 When the sparse checkout feature is in use, "git cherry-pick" and
 other mergy operations lost the skip_worktree bit when a path that
 is excluded from checkout requires content level merge, which is
 resolved as the same as the HEAD version, without materializing the
 merge result in the working tree, which made the path appear as
 deleted.  This has been corrected by preserving the skip_worktree
 bit (and not materializing the file in the working tree).

 point running gc to improve the situation); we used to exit with

 "git submodule update" is getting rewritten piece-by-piece into C.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sl/commit-dry-run-with-short-output-fix (2018-07-30) 4 commits
 . commit: fix exit code when doing a dry run
 . wt-status: teach wt_status_collect about merges in progress
 . wt-status: rename commitable to committable
 . t7501: add coverage for flags which imply dry runs

 "git commit --dry-run" gave a correct exit status even during a
 conflict resolution toward a merge, but it did not with the
 "--short" option, which has been corrected.

 Seems to break 7512, 3404 and 7060 in 'pu'.


* tg/rerere (2018-07-16) 11 commits
 - rerere: recalculate conflict ID when unresolved conflict is committed
 - rerere: teach rerere to handle nested conflicts
 - rerere: return strbuf from handle path
 - rerere: factor out handle_conflict function
 - rerere: only return whether a path has conflicts or not
 - rerere: fix crash when conflict goes unresolved
 - rerere: add documentation for conflict normalization
 - rerere: mark strings for translation
 - rerere: wrap paths in output in sq
 - rerere: lowercase error messages
 - rerere: unify error messages when read_cache fails

 Fixes to "git rerere" corner cases, especially when conflict
 markers cannot be parsed in the file.

 I am not sure about the "nested" stuff, though.


* jk/ui-color-always-to-auto (2018-07-18) 1 commit

* js/range-diff (2018-07-30) 21 commits
 - range-diff: use dim/bold cues to improve dual color mode

 - diff: add an internal option to dual-color diffs of diffs
 - color: add the meta color GIT_COLOR_REVERSE
 - range-diff: use color for the commit pairs
 - range-diff: add tests
 - range-diff: do not show "function names" in hunk headers

 (this branch is used by es/format-patch-rangediff and sb/range-diff-colors.)

 "git tbdiff" that lets us compare individual patches in two
 iterations of a topic has been rewritten and made into a built-in
 command.

 It seems there will another hopefully the final reroll coming.

* lt/date-human (2018-07-09) 1 commit
 - Add 'human' date format

 A new date format "--date=human" that morphs its output depending
 on how far the time is from the current time has been introduced.
 "--date=auto" can be used to use this new format when the output is
 goint to the pager or to the terminal and otherwise the default
 format.


* ot/ref-filter-object-info (2018-07-17) 5 commits
 - ref-filter: use oid_object_info() to get object
 - ref-filter: merge get_obj and get_object
 - ref-filter: initialize eaten variable
 - ref-filter: fill empty fields with empty values
 - ref-filter: add info_source to valid_atom

 A few atoms like %(objecttype) and %(objectsize) in the format
 specifier of "for-each-ref --format=<format>" can be filled without
 getting the full contents of the object, but just with the object
 header.  These cases have been optimzied by calling
 oid_object_info() API.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* pk/rebase-in-c (2018-07-30) 3 commits
 - builtin/rebase: support running "git rebase <upstream>"
 - rebase: refactor common shell functions into their own file
 - rebase: start implementing it as a builtin

 Rewrite of the "rebase" machinery in C.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/branch-l-1-repurpose (2018-06-22) 1 commit
 - branch: make "-l" a synonym for "--list"

 Updated plan to repurpose the "-l" option to "git branch".

 Will hold in 'pu' until jk/branch-l-0-deprecation progresses sufficiently.


* cc/remote-odb (2018-08-02) 9 commits
 - Documentation/config: add odb.<name>.promisorRemote
 - t0410: test fetching from many promisor remotes
 - Use odb.origin.partialclonefilter instead of core.partialclonefilter
 - Use remote_odb_get_direct() and has_remote_odb()
 - remote-odb: add remote_odb_reinit()
 - remote-odb: implement remote_odb_get_many_direct()
 - remote-odb: implement remote_odb_get_direct()
 - Add initial remote odb support
 - fetch-object: make functions return an error code

 Implement lazy fetches of missing objects to complement the
 experimental partial clone feature.

 I haven't seen much interest in this topic on list.  What's the
 doneness of this thing?

 I do not particularly mind adding code to support a niche feature
 as long as it is cleanly made and it is clear that the feature
 won't negatively affect those who do not use it, so a review from
 that point of view may also be appropriate.


* ds/multi-pack-index (2018-07-20) 23 commits
 - midx: clear midx on repack
 - packfile: skip loading index if in multi-pack-index
 - midx: prevent duplicate packfile loads
 - midx: use midx in approximate_object_count
 - midx: use existing midx when writing new one
 - midx: use midx in abbreviation calculations
 - midx: read objects from multi-pack-index
 - config: create core.multiPackIndex setting
 - midx: write object offsets
 - midx: write object id fanout chunk
 - midx: write object ids in a chunk
 - midx: sort and deduplicate objects from packfiles

 - midx: write header information to lockfile
 - multi-pack-index: add 'write' verb
 - multi-pack-index: add builtin
 - multi-pack-index: add format details
 - multi-pack-index: add design document

 When there are too many packfiles in a repository (which is not
 recommended), looking up an object in these would require
 consulting many pack .idx files; a new mechanism to have a single
 file that consolidates all of these .idx files is introduced.

 Will merge to and cook in 'next'.
