Subject: What's cooking in git.git (Jan 2013, #02; Thu, 3)
X-master-at: 3e293fba627e254b2c7d196bb7563c6c9d2e6f8a

What's cooking in git.git (Jan 2013, #02; Thu, 3)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.

The post 1.8.1 cycle has started, and about a dozen topics (mostly
fixes) have graduated to the 'master' branch.  The second batch will
follow shortly.

As usual, this cycle is expected to last for 8 to 10 weeks.  To
ensure the quality of the end result, let's merge topics in flight
earlier than previous cycles to 'next' and fix issues in-tree.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches of the
repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* jn/less-reconfigure (2013-01-02) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-02 at e5cd6cf)
 + build: do not automatically reconfigure unless configure.ac changed

 When autoconf is used, any build on a different commit always ran
 "config.status --recheck" even when unnecessary.


* ap/merge-stop-at-prepare-commit-msg-failure (2013-01-03) 1 commit
 - merge: Honor prepare-commit-msg return code

 "git merge" started calling prepare-commit-msg hook like "git
 commit" does some time ago, but forgot to pay attention to the exit
 status of the hook.  t7505 may want a general clean-up but that is
 a different topic.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* tb/test-shell-lint (2013-01-02) 1 commit
 - test: Add check-non-portable-shell.pl

 Check for common mistakes in the test scripts, based on simple
 pattern-matching.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/enable-test-lint-by-default (2013-01-03) 1 commit
 - tests: turn on test-lint by default

 We had two simple and quick tests to catch common mistakes when
 writing test scripts, but they weren't run by default when running
 tests.

 Will merge to 'next'.

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* as/test-tweaks (2012-12-20) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-12-22 at 7312c6c)
 + tests: paint unexpectedly fixed known breakages in bold red
 + tests: test the test framework more thoroughly
 + tests: refactor mechanics of testing in a sub test-lib
 + tests: change info messages from yellow/brown to cyan
 + tests: paint skipped tests in blue
 + tests: paint known breakages in yellow
 + tests: test number comes first in 'not ok $count - $message'

 Output from the tests is coloured using "green is okay, yellow is
 questionable, red is bad and blue is informative" scheme.


* da/p4merge-mktemp (2012-12-26) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-12-26 at 036938a)
 + mergetools/p4merge: Honor $TMPDIR for the /dev/null placeholder

 Create an empty file in $TMPDIR instead of using an empty file in
 the local directory.


* dm/port (2012-12-19) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-12-22 at 8adc198)
 + git-compat-util.h: do not #include <sys/param.h> by default
 + Generalize the inclusion of strings.h
 + Detect when the passwd struct is missing pw_gecos
 + Support builds when sys/param.h is missing
 (this branch is used by mk/qnx.)

 Add a few more knobs for new platform ports can tweak.


* jc/maint-fbsd-sh-ifs-workaround (2012-12-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-12-11 at 6659fdc)
 + sh-setup: work around "unset IFS" bug in some shells

 Some shells do not behave correctly when IFS is unset; work it
 around by explicitly setting it to the default value.


* jc/maint-fnmatch-old-style-definition (2012-12-19) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-12-22 at 540df2c)
 + compat/fnmatch: update old-style definition to ANSI

 Update old-style function definition "int foo(bar) int bar; {}"
 to "int foo(int bar) {}".


* jc/maint-test-portability (2012-12-19) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-12-22 at daeed53)
 + t4014: fix arguments to grep
 + t9502: do not assume GNU tar
 + t0200: "locale" may not exist
 (this branch is used by jc/test-portability.)

 Minor test fixes noticed while running our tests on OpenBSD 5.2,
 applicable to 'maint'.


* jc/mkstemp-more-careful-error-reporting (2012-12-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-12-22 at 18cdaf0)
 + xmkstemp(): avoid showing truncated template more carefully

 After failing to create a temporary file using mkstemp(), failing
 pathname was not reported correctly on some platforms.


* jc/same-encoding (2012-12-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-12-17 at 86b41c7)
 + format_commit_message(): simplify calls to logmsg_reencode()

 Finishing touches to the series to unify "Do we need to reencode
 between these two encodings?" logic.


* jc/test-cvs-no-init-in-existing-dir (2012-12-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-12-26 at 3b93f37)
 + t9200: let "cvs init" create the test repository

 t9200 runs "cvs init" on a directory that already exists, but a
 platform can configure this fail for the current user (e.g. you
 need to be in the cvsadmin group on NetBSD 6.0).


* jc/test-portability (2012-12-19) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-12-22 at 123041b)
 + t9020: use configured Python to run the test helper
 + t3600: Avoid "cp -a", which is a GNUism
 + Merge branch 'jc/maint-test-portability' into 'jc/test-portability'
 (this branch uses jc/maint-test-portability.)

 The remainder of jc/maint-test-portability, applicable to 'master'.


* jk/repack-ref-racefix (2012-12-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-12-22 at 03e1ca9)
 + refs: do not use cached refs in repack_without_ref

 "git pack-refs" that ran in parallel to another process that
 created new refs had a nasty race.


* md/gitweb-sort-by-age (2012-12-11) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-12-13 at 9f39410)
 + gitweb: Sort projects with undefined ages last

 Gitweb showed repositories without any commit at the top in its
 age-sorted view, in which the users are interested in looking at
 active projects; sorting them at the bottom makes it more useful.


* mh/ceiling (2012-10-29) 8 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-11-26 at d1ce76a)
 + string_list_longest_prefix(): remove function
 + setup_git_directory_gently_1(): resolve symlinks in ceiling paths
 + longest_ancestor_length(): require prefix list entries to be normalized
 + longest_ancestor_length(): take a string_list argument for prefixes
 + longest_ancestor_length(): use string_list_split()
 + Introduce new function real_path_if_valid()
 + real_path_internal(): add comment explaining use of cwd
 + Introduce new static function real_path_internal()

 Elements of GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES list may not match the real
 pathname we obtain from getcwd(), leading the GIT_DIR discovery
 logic to escape the ceilings the user thought to have specified.


* mh/pthreads-autoconf (2012-11-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-11-28 at 780600e)
 + configure.ac: fix pthreads detection on Mac OS X


* mk/maint-graph-infinity-loop (2012-09-25) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-12-26 at 2ff59ab)
 + graph.c: infinite loop in git whatchanged --graph -m

 The --graph code fell into infinite loop when asked to do what the
 code did not expect ;-)


* mk/qnx (2012-12-19) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-12-22 at 0473197)
 + Port to QNX
 + Make lock local to fetch_pack
 (this branch uses dm/port.)

 Port to QNX.


* ms/subtree-fixlets (2012-12-22) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-12-26 at 1cb26eb)
 + git-subtree: fix typo in manpage
 + git-subtree: ignore git-subtree executable


* nd/invalidate-i-t-a-cache-tree (2012-12-15) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-12-18 at 33e4488)
 + cache-tree: invalidate i-t-a paths after generating trees
 + cache-tree: fix writing cache-tree when CE_REMOVE is present
 + cache-tree: replace "for" loops in update_one with "while" loops
 + cache-tree: remove dead i-t-a code in verify_cache()

 Writing out a tree object when you still have intent-to-add entries
 in the index left an incorrect cache-tree data there.


* pf/editor-ignore-sigint (2012-12-02) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-12-07 at 6b04419)
 + launch_editor: propagate signals from editor to git
 + run-command: do not warn about child death from terminal
 + launch_editor: ignore terminal signals while editor has control
 + launch_editor: refactor to use start/finish_command
 + run-command: drop silent_exec_failure arg from wait_or_whine

 The behaviour visible to the end users was confusing, when they
 attempt to kill a process spawned in the editor that was in turn
 launched by Git with SIGINT (or SIGQUIT), as Git would catch that
 signal and die.  We ignore these signals now.


* rb/http-cert-cred-no-username-prompt (2012-12-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-12-22 at 9fc28ed)
 + http.c: Avoid username prompt for certifcate credentials

 It is wrong to ask for username if the authentication is done by
 certificate identity.


* sp/shortlog-missing-lf (2012-12-11) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-12-11 at 64b8429)
 + strbuf_add_wrapped*(): Remove unused return value
 + shortlog: fix wrapping lines of wraplen

 When a line to be wrapped has a solid run of non space characters
 whose length exactly is the wrap width, "git shortlog -w" failed to
 add a newline after such a line.


* ss/nedmalloc-compilation (2012-12-11) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-12-13 at c1f0d7f)
 + nedmalloc: Fix a compile warning (exposed as error) with GCC 4.7.2


* ss/svn-prompt (2012-12-17) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-12-26 at 1012ae2)
 + git-svn, perl/Git.pm: extend and use Git->prompt method for querying users
 + perl/Git.pm: Honor SSH_ASKPASS as fallback if GIT_ASKPASS is not set
 + git-svn, perl/Git.pm: add central method for prompting passwords

 Tweak the way "git svn" asks for password to be in line with the
 rest of the system, so that the same SSH/GIT_ASKPASS can be used.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* jl/submodule-deinit (2012-12-04) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-12-07 at ea772f0)
 + submodule: add 'deinit' command

 There was no Porcelain way to say "I no longer am interested in
 this submodule", once you express your interest in a submodule with
 "submodule init".  "submodule deinit" is the way to do so.

 But this does not yet do so (does not remove the checkout of the
 submodule).  The design discussion petered out.

 http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/210867/focus=211456

 Will kick back to 'pu'.


* jc/doc-maintainer (2012-11-27) 1 commit
 - update "howto maintain git"

 An early draft that is still incomplete.


* jk/lua-hackery (2012-10-07) 6 commits
 - pretty: fix up one-off format_commit_message calls
 - Minimum compilation fixup
 - Makefile: make "lua" a bit more configurable
 - add a "lua" pretty format
 - add basic lua infrastructure
 - pretty: make some commit-parsing helpers more public

 Interesting exercise. When we do this for real, we probably would want
 to wrap a commit to make it more like an "object" with methods like
 "parents", etc.


* rc/maint-complete-git-p4 (2012-09-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-10-29 at af52cef)
 + Teach git-completion about git p4

 Comment from Pete will need to be addressed ($gmane/206172).

 Will kick back to 'pu'.


* jc/maint-name-rev (2012-09-17) 7 commits
 - describe --contains: use "name-rev --algorithm=weight"
 - name-rev --algorithm=weight: tests and documentation
 - name-rev --algorithm=weight: cache the computed weight in notes
 - name-rev --algorithm=weight: trivial optimization
 - name-rev: --algorithm option
 - name_rev: clarify the logic to assign a new tip-name to a commit
 - name-rev: lose unnecessary typedef

 "git name-rev" names the given revision based on a ref that can be
 reached in the smallest number of steps from the rev, but that is
 not useful when the caller wants to know which tag is the oldest one
 that contains the rev.  This teaches a new mode to the command that
 uses the oldest ref among those which contain the rev.

 I am not sure if this is worth it; for one thing, even with the help
 from notes-cache, it seems to make the "describe --contains" even
 slower. Also the command will be unusably slow for a user who does
 not have a write access (hence unable to create or update the
 notes-cache).

 Stalled mostly due to lack of responses.


* jc/xprm-generation (2012-09-14) 1 commit
 - test-generation: compute generation numbers and clock skews

 A toy to analyze how bad the clock skews are in histories of real
 world projects.

 Stalled mostly due to lack of responses.


* jc/blame-no-follow (2012-09-21) 2 commits
 - blame: pay attention to --no-follow
 - diff: accept --no-follow option

 Teaches "--no-follow" option to "git blame" to disable its
 whole-file rename detection.

 Stalled mostly due to lack of responses.


* jc/add-delete-default (2012-08-13) 1 commit
 - git add: notice removal of tracked paths by default

 "git add dir/" updated modified files and added new files, but does
 not notice removed files, which may be "Huh?" to some users.  They
 can of course use "git add -A dir/", but why should they?

 Resurrected from graveyard, as I thought it was a worthwhile thing
 to do in the longer term.

 Waiting for comments.


* mb/remote-default-nn-origin (2012-07-11) 6 commits
 - Teach get_default_remote to respect remote.default.
 - Test that plain "git fetch" uses remote.default when on a detached HEAD.
 - Teach clone to set remote.default.
 - Teach "git remote" about remote.default.
 - Teach remote.c about the remote.default configuration setting.
 - Rename remote.c's default_remote_name static variables.

 When the user does not specify what remote to interact with, we
 often attempt to use 'origin'.  This can now be customized via a
 configuration variable.

 Expecting a reroll.
 $gmane/210151

 "The first remote becomes the default" bit is better done as a
 separate step.

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* jc/doc-default-format (2013-01-03) 2 commits
 - Allow installing a non-default set of documentation
 - Allow generating a non-default set of documentation

 Instead of the default of generating html/man and installing man,
 you can control what "make doc" and "make install-doc" do via two
 make variables.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* fc/remote-testgit-feature-done (2012-10-29) 1 commit
 - remote-testgit: properly check for errors

 In the longer term, tightening rules is a good thing to do, and
 because nobody who has worked in the remote helper area seems to be
 interested in reviewing this, I would assume they do not think
 such a retroactive tightening will affect their remote helpers.  So
 let's advance this topic to see what happens.


* fc/remote-bzr (2013-01-02) 9 commits
 - remote-bzr: detect local repositories
 - remote-bzr: add support for older versions of bzr
 - remote-bzr: add support to push special modes
 - remote-bzr: add support for fecthing special modes
 - remote-bzr: add simple tests
 - remote-bzr: update working tree upon pushing
 - remote-bzr: add support for remote repositories
 - remote-bzr: add support for pushing
 - Add new remote-bzr transport helper

 New remote helper for bzr, with minimum fix squashed in.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* mo/cvs-server-updates (2012-12-09) 18 commits
 - t9402: Use TABs for indentation
 - t9402: Rename check.cvsCount and check.list
 - t9402: Simplify git ls-tree
 - t9402: Add missing &&; Code style
 - t9402: No space after IO-redirection
 - t9402: Dont use test_must_fail cvs
 - t9402: improve check_end_tree() and check_end_full_tree()
 - t9402: sed -i is not portable
 - cvsserver Documentation: new cvs ... -r support
 - cvsserver: add t9402 to test branch and tag refs
 - cvsserver: support -r and sticky tags for most operations
 - cvsserver: Add version awareness to argsfromdir
 - cvsserver: generalize getmeta() to recognize commit refs
 - cvsserver: implement req_Sticky and related utilities
 - cvsserver: add misc commit lookup, file meta data, and file listing functions
 - cvsserver: define a tag name character escape mechanism
 - cvsserver: cleanup extra slashes in filename arguments
 - cvsserver: factor out git-log parsing logic

 As nobody seems to be stepping up to review this, I am tempted to
 merge this to 'next and see who screams.


* jc/submittingpatches (2013-01-02) 4 commits
 - SubmittingPatches: give list and maintainer addresses
 - SubmittingPatches: remove overlong checklist
 - SubmittingPatches: mention subsystems with dedicated repositories
 - SubmittingPatches: who am I and who cares?

 Will merge to 'next'.


* kb/maint-bundle-doc (2013-01-01) 2 commits
 - Documentation: full-ness of a bundle is significant for cloning
 - Documentation: correct example restore from bundle

 Will merge to 'next'.


* nd/maint-branch-desc-doc (2013-01-03) 5 commits
 - format-patch: pick up branch description when no ref is specified
 - format-patch: pick up correct branch name from symbolic ref
 - t4014: a few more tests on cover letter using branch description
 - branch: delete branch description if it's empty
 - config.txt: a few lines about branch.<name>.description

 Will merge to 'next'.


* tb/test-t9020-no-which (2013-01-01) 1 commit
 - t9020: which is not portable

 Will merge to 'next'.


* tb/test-t9810-no-sed-i (2013-01-01) 1 commit
 - t9810: Do not use sed -i

 Will merge to 'next'.


* aw/rebase-am-failure-detection (2012-10-11) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-02 at b9db3a2)
 + rebase: Handle cases where format-patch fails

 Save output from format-patch command in a temporary file, just in
 case it aborts, to give a better failure-case behaviour.


* ap/status-ignored-in-ignored-directory (2013-01-01) 2 commits
 - git-status: Test --ignored behavior
 - dir.c: Make git-status --ignored more consistent

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ta/remove-stale-translated-tut (2012-12-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-02 at e70df8e)
 + Remove Documentation/pt_BR/gittutorial.txt

 Remove a translation of a document that was left stale.


* er/stop-recommending-parsecvs (2012-12-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-02 at fd816dd)
 + Remove the suggestion to use parsecvs, which is currently broken.

 Stop recommending a defunct third-party software.


* as/test-name-alias-uniquely (2012-12-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-02 at e297810)
 + Use longer alias names in subdirectory tests

 A few short-and-bland aliases used in the tests were interfering
 with git-custom command in user's $PATH.


* jc/maint-fmt-merge-msg-no-edit-lose-credit (2012-12-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-02 at 8795e87)
 + merge --no-edit: do not credit people involved in the side branch

 Stop spending cycles to compute information to be placed on
 commented lines in "merge --no-edit".


* as/check-ignore (2012-12-28) 19 commits
 - Add git-check-ignore sub-command
 - setup.c: document get_pathspec()
 - pathspec.c: extract new validate_path() for reuse

 - dir.c: rename cryptic 'which' variable to more consistent name
 - Improve documentation and comments regarding directory traversal API
 - api-directory-listing.txt: update to match code

 Rerolled.  The early parts looked mostly fine; we may want to split
 this into two topics and have the early half graduate sooner.


* jc/format-patch-reroll (2013-01-02) 9 commits
 - format-patch: give --reroll-count a short synonym -v
 - format-patch: document and test --reroll-count

 - builtin/log.c: drop unused "numbered" parameter from make_cover_letter()

 Teach "format-patch" to prefix v4- to its output files for the
 fourth iteration of a patch series, to make it easier for the
 submitter to keep separate copies for iterations.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* mz/pick-unborn (2012-12-23) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-02 at 22b9951)
 + learn to pick/revert into unborn branch
 + tests: move test_cmp_rev to test-lib-functions

 Allows "git cherry-pick $commit" when you do not have any history
 behind HEAD yet.


* nd/retire-fnmatch (2013-01-01) 7 commits
 - Makefile: add USE_WILDMATCH to use wildmatch as fnmatch
 - wildmatch: advance faster in <asterisk> + <literal> patterns
 - wildmatch: make a special case for "*/" with FNM_PATHNAME
 - test-wildmatch: add "perf" command to compare wildmatch and fnmatch
 - wildmatch: support "no FNM_PATHNAME" mode
 - wildmatch: make dowild() take arbitrary flags
 - wildmatch: rename constants and update prototype
 (this branch uses nd/wildmatch.)

 Replace our use of fnmatch(3) with a more feature-rich wildmatch.
 A handful patches at the bottom have been moved to nd/wildmatch to
 graduate as part of that branch, before this series solidifies.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* os/gitweb-highlight-uncaptured (2013-01-01) 1 commit
 - gitweb: fix error in sanitize when highlight is enabled

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jc/merge-blobs (2012-12-26) 5 commits
 - merge-tree: fix d/f conflicts
 - merge-tree: add comments to clarify what these functions are doing
 - merge-tree: lose unused "resolve_directories"
 - merge-tree: lose unused "flags" from merge_list
 - Which merge_file() function do you mean?

 A beginning of a new merge strategy based on the disused merge-tree
 proof-of-concept code.


* jk/pathspec-literal (2012-12-19) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-12-22 at c794bd6)
 + add global --literal-pathspecs option

 Allow scripts to feed literal paths to commands that take
 pathspecs, by disabling wildcard globbing.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* er/python-version-requirements (2012-12-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2013-01-02 at 1023a3f)
 + Add checks to Python scripts for version dependencies.

 Some python scripts we ship cannot be run with old versions of the
 interpreter.


* mb/gitweb-highlight-link-target (2012-12-20) 1 commit
 - Highlight the link target line in Gitweb using CSS

 Expecting a reroll.
 $gmane/211935


* mz/oneway-merge-wo-u-no-lstat (2012-12-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-12-22 at 87bd30e)
 + oneway_merge(): only lstat() when told to update worktree

 Optimize "read-tree -m <tree-ish>" without "-u".


* wk/submodule-update-remote (2012-12-19) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-12-22 at 7ddf897)
 + submodule add: If --branch is given, record it in .gitmodules
 + submodule update: add --remote for submodule's upstream changes
 + submodule: add get_submodule_config helper funtion

 The beginning of 'integrate with the tip of the remote branch, not
 the commit recorded in the superproject gitlink' support.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* cc/no-gitk-build-dependency (2012-12-18) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-12-22 at da7b2cf)
 + Makefile: replace "echo 1>..." with "echo >..."
 + Makefile: detect when PYTHON_PATH changes
 + Makefile: remove tracking of TCLTK_PATH

 Remove leftover bits from an earlier change to move gitk in its own
 subdirectory.  Reimplementing the dependency tracking rules needs
 to be done in gitk history separately.

* jc/format-color-auto (2012-12-17) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-12-18 at 5aaac94)
 + log --format: teach %C(auto,black) to respect color config
 + t6006: clean up whitespace

 Introduce "log --format=%C(auto,blue)Foo%C(auto,reset)" that does
 not color its output when writing to a non-terminal.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* zk/clean-report-failure (2013-01-02) 2 commits
 - (SQUASH???) fix-up only the trivial bits
 - git-clean: Display more accurate delete messages

 "git clean" states what it is going to remove and then goes on to
 remove it, but sometimes it only discovers things that cannot be
 removed after recursing into a directory, which makes the output
 confusing and even wrong.

 Rerolled, and comments sent.


* mp/complete-paths (2012-12-21) 1 commit
 - git-completion.bash: add support for path completion

 The completion script used to let the default completer to suggest
 pathnames, which gave too many irrelevant choices (e.g. "git add"
 would not want to add an unmodified path).  Teach it to use a more
 git-aware logic to enumerate only relevant ones.

 Waiting for area-experts' review.


* ja/directory-attrs (2012-12-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-12-17 at ced8e73)
 + Add directory pattern matching to attributes

 The attribute mechanism didn't allow limiting attributes to be
 applied to only a single directory itself with "path/" like the
 exclude mechanism does.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/mailmap-from-blob (2012-12-13) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-12-17 at 14b7cdc)

 + mailmap: fix some documentation loose-ends for mailmap.blob
 + mailmap: clean up read_mailmap error handling
 + mailmap: support reading mailmap from blobs
 + mailmap: refactor mailmap parsing for non-file sources

 Allow us to read, and default to read, mailmap files from the tip
 of the history in bare repositories.  This will help running tools
 like shortlog in server settings.

 Will merge to 'master'.

  (merged to 'next' on 2012-12-18 at 75b5f21)
 + completion: complete refs for "git commit -c"

 Complete "git commmit -c foo<TAB>" into a refname that begins with
 "foo".

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/error-const-return (2012-12-15) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-12-22 at bf2b1cd)
 + silence some -Wuninitialized false positives
 + make error()'s constant return value more visible

 Help compilers' flow analysis by making it more explicit that
 error() always returns -1, to reduce false "variable used
 uninitialized" warnings.  Looks somewhat ugly but not too much.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 (this branch is used by jc/mailmap.)

 Clean up various codepaths around mailmap and teach the "log"
 machinery to use it.

 Expecting a reroll.

 + apply.c:update_pre_post_images(): the preimage can be truncated

 Fix to update_pre_post_images() that did not take into account the
 possibility that whitespace fix could shrink the preimage and
 change the number of lines in it.
