What's cooking in git.git (Dec 2022, #05; Wed, 14)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a future
release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and aren't
considered "accepted" at all.  A topic without enough support may be
discarded after a long period of no activity.

The first batch of topics have graduated from 'next' to 'master'.

In the past, I tried to re-examine all the topics in 'next' myself
to pick and choose the ones to be kept before rewinding and
rebuilding 'next' after each release, which took me a while.  This
time, to share the burden to expedite the process, I'll reset 'next'
to 'master' without any topics merged, and rely on input from list
participants.

The topics that used to be in 'next' are all marked as "Will merge
back to 'next'", but people can tell me to give them a chance to
reboot their topics, instead of piling "oops, that was wrong" fixes
on top, while I wait for such an input for the coming days.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

 + var: allow GIT_EDITOR to return null
 + var: do not print usage() with a correct invocation

 "git var UNKNOWN_VARIABLE" and "git var VARIABLE" with the variable
 given an empty value used to behave identically.  Now the latter

 it invokes), and learned to also drive emacs/emacsclient.

 - object-file: remove OBJECT_INFO_IGNORE_LOOSE

 Even in a repository with promissor remote, it is useless to

 advantage of this assumption to fail fast on errors.
