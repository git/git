What's cooking in git.git (Sep 2024, #12; Sun, 29)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and
aren't considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL
to a message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity (of course they can be resubmit when new interests
arise).

A handful of topics in 'next' will be flushed to 'master' and then
we will tag -rc1 in the middle of this week.

Unfortunately our CI jobs seem to be failing due to
https://lore.kernel.org/git/xmqqmsk37926.fsf@gitster.g/ The
regression in libCurl 8.10.0 has been identified and corrected in
the upstream, but apparently it takes time for the fix to percolate
down.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-scm/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

Release tarballs are available at:

* ds/sparse-checkout-expansion-advice (2024-09-23) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2024-09-27 at e670bccf7e)
 + sparse-checkout: disable advice in 'disable'

 When "git sparse-checkout disable" turns a sparse checkout into a
 regular checkout, the index is fully expanded.  This totally
 expected behaviour however had an "oops, we are expanding the
 index" advice message, which has been corrected.

* es/worktree-repair-copied (2024-09-23) 1 commit
 - worktree: repair copied repository and linked worktrees

 The heuristics in "git worktree repair" can be confused when a
 worktree and its repository are copied and break correctly
 configured worktree and repository that point at each other, which
 has been corrected.

 Needs review.

 "git gc" in a partial clone (i.e. lacking objects that can be
 lazily fetched from promisor remotes) collected more than objects
 that promisor-remote can give.

* ds/background-maintenance-with-credential (2024-09-20) 3 commits

 + scalar: configure maintenance during 'reconfigure'
 + maintenance: add custom config to background jobs
 + credential: add new interactive config option

 Background tasks "git maintenance" runs may need to use credential
 information when going over the network, but a credential helper
 may work only in an interactive environment, and end up blocking a
 scheduled task waiting for UI.  Credential helpers can now behave
 differently when they are not running interactively.

  (merged to 'next' on 2024-09-24 at 9e1ce951c6)
 + submodule status: propagate SIGPIPE

 When a subprocess to work in a submodule spawned by "git submodule"
 fails with SIGPIPE, the parent Git process caught the death of it,
 but gave a generic "failed to work in that submodule", which was
 misleading.  We now behave as if the parent got SIGPIPE and die.

 The reftable library is now prepared to expect that the memory
 allocation function given to it may fail to allocate and to deal
 with such an error.

 Expecting a reroll (v3).

* jc/strbuf-commented-something (2024-09-12) 2 commits
 - strbuf: retire strbuf_commented_lines()
 - strbuf: retire strbuf_commented_addf()

 Update two functions whose callers always pass the same global
 variable to omit the redundant parameter and use the global in the
 callee themselves.

 On hold.

* cc/promisor-remote-capability (2024-09-10) 4 commits
 - promisor-remote: check advertised name or URL
 - Add 'promisor-remote' capability to protocol v2
 - strbuf: refactor strbuf_trim_trailing_ch()
 - version: refactor strbuf_sanitize()

 The v2 protocol learned to allow the server to advertise possible
 promisor remotes, and the client to respond with what promissor
 remotes it uses, so that the server side can omit objects that the
 client can lazily obtain from these other promissor remotes.

* ds/pack-name-hash-tweak (2024-09-19) 6 commits
 - test-tool: add helper for name-hash values
 - p5313: add size comparison test
 - git-repack: update usage to match docs
 - pack-objects: add GIT_TEST_FULL_NAME_HASH
 - repack: test --full-name-hash option
 - pack-objects: add --full-name-hash option

 In a repository with too many (more than --window size) similarly
 named files, "git repack" would not find good delta-base candidate
 and worse, it may not use a blob from exactly the same path as a
 good delta-base candidate.  Optionally replace the name hash so
 that only blobs at the same path and nothing else are used as
 delta-base candidate.

 On hold.

 "git fsck" learned to issue warnings on "curiously formatted" ref
 contents that have always been taken valid but something Git
 wouldn't have written itself (e.g., missing terminating end-of-line
 after the full object name).
