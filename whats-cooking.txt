What's cooking in git.git (Dec 2021, #03; Fri, 10)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen',
which means nothing more than that I have found them of interest for
some reason (like "it may have hard-to-resolve conflicts with
another topic already in flight" or "this may turn out to be
useful").  Do not read too much into a topic being in (or not in)
'seen'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of the
integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/

 The advice message given by "git pull" when the user hasn't made a
 choice between merge and rebase still said that the merge is the
 default, which no longer is the case.  This has been corrected.

 + t7006: simplify exit-code checks for sigpipe tests
 + t7006: clean up SIGPIPE handling in trace2 tests
 + run-command: unify signal and regular logic for wait_or_whine()

 The function to cull a child process and determine the exit status
 had two separate code paths for normal callers and callers in a
 signal handler, and the latter did not yield correct value when the
 child has caught a signal.  The handling of the exit status has
 been unified for these two code paths.  An existing test with
 flakiness has also been corrected.

  (merged to 'next' on 2021-12-03 at afc462a692)
 + submodule: absorb git dir instead of dying on deinit

 "git submodule deinit" for a submodule whose .git metadata
 directory is embedded in its working tree refused to work, until
 the submodule gets converted to use the "absorbed" form where the
 metadata directory is stored in superproject, and a gitfile at the
 top-level of the working tree of the submodule points at it.  The
 command is taught to convert such submodules to the absorbed form
 as needed.

* je/http-better-error-output (2021-12-03) 1 commit
 . http-backend: give a hint that web browser access is not supported

 When the http-backend program, which is the server-side component
 for the smart HTTP transport, sends a "404 Not found" error, we
 deliberately did not say anything to the requesting client.  We now
 send a message back to the browser to tell the user that they do
 not want to visit the URL via their browser, instead of a totally
 blank page.

 Expecting a reroll.
 Breaks its self tests.

 + worktree: send "chatty" messages to stderr

 "git worktree add" showed "Preparing worktree" message to the
 standard output stream, but when it failed, the message from die()
 went to the standard error stream.  Depending on the order the
 stdio streams are flushed at the program end, this resulted in
 confusing output.  It has been corrected by sending all the chatty
 messages to the standard error stream.

 - t2501: add various tests for removing the current working directory

 Many git commands that deal with working tree files try to remove a
 directory that becomes empty (i.e. "git switch" from a branch that
 has the directory to another branch that does not would attempt
 remove all files in the directory and the directory itself).  This
 drops users into an unfamiliar situation if the command was run in
 a subdirectory that becomes subject to removal due to the command.
 The commands have been taught to keep an empty directory if it is
 the directory they were started in to avoid surprising users.

 + receive-pack: ignore SIGPIPE while reporting status to client

 When the "git push" command is killed while the receiving end is
 trying to report what happened to the ref update proposals, the
 latter used to die, due to SIGPIPE.  The code now ignores SIGPIPE
 to increase our chances to run the post-receive hook after it
 happens.

  (merged to 'next' on 2021-12-10 at dd2c6a557c)
 + branch: protect branches checked out in all worktrees
 + receive-pack: protect current branch for bare repository worktree
 + receive-pack: clean dead code from update_worktree()
 + fetch: protect branches checked out in all worktrees
 + worktree: simplify find_shared_symref() memory ownership model
 + branch: lowercase error messages
 + receive-pack: lowercase error messages
 + fetch: lowercase error messages

 "git fetch" without the "--update-head-ok" option ought to protect
 a checked out branch from getting updated, to prevent the working
 tree that checks it out to go out of sync.  The code was written
 before the use of "git worktree" got widespread, and only checked
 the branch that was checked out in the current worktree, which has
 been updated.

 somebody other than Ævar would be sufficient to move it in some
