What's cooking in git.git (Jun 2017, #09; Fri, 30)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

[Graduated to "master"]

* ab/die-errors-in-threaded (2017-06-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-06-24 at 135fc4b963)
 + die(): stop hiding errors due to overzealous recursion guard

 Traditionally, the default die() routine had a code to prevent it
 from getting called multiple times, which interacted badly when a
 threaded program used it (one downside is that the real error may
 be hidden and instead the only error message given to the user may
 end up being "die recursion detected", which is not very useful).


* ah/doc-pretty-color-auto-prefix (2017-06-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-06-26 at d7489fc831)
 + doc: clarify syntax for %C(auto,...) in pretty formats

 Doc update.


* jc/pack-bitmap-unaligned (2017-06-26) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-06-28 at ad026b12a3)
 + pack-bitmap: don't perform unaligned memory access

 An unaligned 32-bit access in pack-bitmap code ahs been corrected.


* ks/status-initial-commit (2017-06-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-06-24 at 940ffd5816)
 + status: contextually notify user about an initial commit

 "git status" has long shown essentially the same message as "git
 commit"; the message it gives while preparing for the root commit,
 i.e. "Initial commit", was hard to understand for some new users.
 Now it says "No commits yet" to stress more on the current status
 (rather than the commit the user is preparing for, which is more in
 line with the focus of "git commit").


* ks/submodule-add-doc (2017-06-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-06-24 at 26309b38f2)
 + Documentation/git-submodule: cleanup "add" section

 Doc update.


* pw/rebase-i-regression-fix-tests (2017-06-23) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-06-23 at 835ae762f5)
 + t3420: fix under GETTEXT_POISON build
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-06-22 at d1dde1672a)
 + rebase: add more regression tests for console output
 + rebase: add regression tests for console output
 + rebase -i: add test for reflog message
 + sequencer: print autostash messages to stderr

 Fix a recent regression to "git rebase -i" and add tests that would
 have caught it and others.


* rs/apply-validate-input (2017-06-27) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-06-28 at 81e006b50e)
 + apply: check git diffs for mutually exclusive header lines
 + apply: check git diffs for invalid file modes
 + apply: check git diffs for missing old filenames

 Tighten error checks for invalid "git apply" input.


* vs/typofixes (2017-06-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-06-28 at 3d11e0b3fa)
 + Spelling fixes

 Many typofixes.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* ab/grep-lose-opt-regflags (2017-06-30) 6 commits
 - grep: remove redundant REG_NEWLINE when compiling fixed regex
 - grep: remove regflags from the public grep_opt API
 - grep: remove redundant and verbose re-assignments to 0
 - grep: remove redundant "fixed" field re-assignment to 0
 - grep: adjust a redundant grep pattern type assignment
 - grep: remove redundant double assignment to 0

 Code cleanup.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ks/commit-assuming-only-warning-removal (2017-06-30) 2 commits
 - commit-template: distinguish status information unconditionally
 - commit-template: remove outdated notice about explicit paths

 An old message shown in the commit log template was removed, as it
 has outlived its usefulness.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sb/hashmap-customize-comparison (2017-06-30) 3 commits
 - hashmap: migrate documentation from Documentation/technical into header
 - patch-ids.c: use hashmap correctly
 - hashmap.h: compare function has access to a data field
 (this branch is used by sb/diff-color-move.)

 Update the hashmap API so that data to customize the behaviour of
 the comparison function can be specified at the time a hashmap is
 initialized.  This fixes a bug in patch-ids that may have caused
 segfault.


* sb/merge-recursive-code-cleanup (2017-06-30) 1 commit
 - merge-recursive: use DIFF_XDL_SET macro

 Code clean-up.

 Will merge to 'next'.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* mg/status-in-progress-info (2017-05-10) 2 commits
 - status --short --inprogress: spell it as --in-progress
 - status: show in-progress info for short status

 "git status" learns an option to report various operations
 (e.g. "merging") that the user is in the middle of.

 cf. <xmqqmvakcdqw.fsf@gitster.mtv.corp.google.com>


* nd/worktree-move (2017-04-20) 6 commits

 - send-email: --batch-size to work around some SMTP server limit

 "git send-email" learned to overcome some SMTP server limitation
 that does not allow many pieces of e-mails to be sent over a single
 session.

* sg/clone-refspec-from-command-line-config (2017-06-16) 2 commits
 - Documentation/clone: document ignored configuration variables
 - clone: respect additional configured fetch refspecs during initial fetch
 (this branch is used by sg/remote-no-string-refspecs.)

 "git clone -c var=val" is a way to set configuration variables in
 the resulting repository, but it is more useful to also make these
 variables take effect while the initial clone is happening,
 e.g. these configuration variables could be fetch refspecs.

* mt/p4-parse-G-output (2017-06-27) 1 commit
 . git-p4: parse marshal output "p4 -G" in p4 changes

 Use "p4 -G" to make "p4 changes" output more Python-friendly
 to parse.

 Needs review/ack from git-p4 folks.


* aw/contrib-subtree-doc-asciidoctor (2017-06-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-06-30 at af23bd111b)
 + subtree: honour USE_ASCIIDOCTOR when set

 The Makefile rule in contrib/subtree for building documentation
 learned to honour USE_ASCIIDOCTOR just like the main documentation
 set does.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* js/fsck-name-object (2017-06-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-06-30 at 9a08514cf2)

  (merged to 'next' on 2017-06-30 at a8cc490818)
 + submodule--helper: do not call utf8_fprintf() unnecessarily

 Code cleanup.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* rs/free-and-null (2017-06-29) 1 commit
 - coccinelle: polish FREE_AND_NULL rules

 Code cleanup.


* ab/wildmatch (2017-06-23) 1 commit
 - wildmatch: remove unused wildopts parameter

 Prepare the wildmatch API for future enhancements to allow a
 pattern that is repeatedly matched against many strings to be
 precompiled.


* cc/shared-index-permfix (2017-06-25) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-06-26 at bb41584bf0)
 + t1700: make sure split-index respects core.sharedrepository
 + t1301: move modebits() to test-lib-functions.sh
 + read-cache: use shared perms when writing shared index

 The split index code did not honor core.sharedrepository setting
 correctly.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ex/deprecate-empty-pathspec-as-match-all (2017-06-23) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-06-26 at d026281517)
 + pathspec: die on empty strings as pathspec
 + t0027: do not use an empty string as a pathspec element

 The final step to make an empty string as a pathspec element
 illegal.  We started this by first deprecating and warning a
 pathspec that has such an element in 2.11 (Nov 2016).

 Hopefully we can merge this down to the 'master' by the end of the
 year?  A deprecation warning period that is about 1 year does not
 sound too bad.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* sb/pull-rebase-submodule (2017-06-27) 4 commits
 - builtin/fetch cleanup: always set default value for submodule recursing
 - pull: optionally rebase submodules (remote submodule changes only)
 - builtin/fetch: parse recurse-submodules-default at default options parsing
 - builtin/fetch: factor submodule recurse parsing out to submodule config

 "git pull --rebase --recurse-submodules" learns to rebase the
 branch in the submodules to an updated base.


* bw/repo-object (2017-06-23) 21 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-06-26 at ed9c0b77c3)

 Introduce a "repository" object to eventually make it easier to
 work in multiple repositories (the primary focus is to work with
 the superproject and its submodules) in a single process.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* pw/unquote-path-in-git-pm (2017-06-30) 4 commits
 - t9700: add tests for Git::unquote_path()

 + sha1_name: cache readdir(3) results in find_short_object_filename()

 Optimize "what are the object names already taken in an alternate
 object database?" query that is used to derive the length of prefix
 an object name is uniquely abbreviated to.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jt/unify-object-info (2017-06-26) 8 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2017-06-26 at 540ea81983)

 - read_packed_refs(): die if `packed-refs` contains bogus data
 - repack_without_refs(): don't lock or unlock the packed refs
 - commit_packed_refs(): remove call to `packed_refs_unlock()`
 - clear_packed_ref_cache(): don't protest if the lock is held
 - packed_refs_unlock(), packed_refs_is_locked(): new functions
 - packed_refs_lock(): report errors via a `struct strbuf *err`
 - packed_refs_lock(): function renamed from lock_packed_refs()
 - commit_packed_refs(): use a staging file separate from the lockfile
 - commit_packed_refs(): report errors rather than dying

 The "ref-store" code reorganization continues.

 Is this now ready for 'next'?


* sb/submodule-doc (2017-06-22) 1 commit
 - submodules: overhaul documentation

 Doc update.

 Waiting for discussion to settle.


* sd/branch-copy (2017-06-18) 3 commits
 - branch: add a --copy (-c) option to go with --move (-m)
 - branch: add test for -m renaming multiple config sections
 - config: create a function to format section headers

 "git branch" learned "-c/-C" to create and switch to a new branch
 by copying an existing one.

 Has a bit of interaction with mh/packed-ref-store and bw/config-h,
 so perhaps needs to wait for the former to stabilize a bit more
 and possibly rebasing on them.


* ls/filter-process-delayed (2017-06-30) 7 commits
 - convert: add "status=delayed" to filter process protocol
 - convert: refactor capabilities negotiation
 - convert: move multiple file filter error handling to separate function
 - convert: put the flags field before the flag itself for consistent style
 - t0021: write "OUT <size>" only on success
 - t0021: make debug log file name configurable
 - t0021: keep filter log files on comparison

 The filter-process interface learned to allow a process with long
 latency give a "delayed" response.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ab/sha1dc (2017-06-27) 3 commits
 - sha1collisiondetection: automatically enable when submodule is populated
 - sha1dc: optionally use sha1collisiondetection as a submodule
 - sha1dc: correct endian detection for Solaris (and others?)

 The "collission-detecting" implementation of SHA-1 hash we borrowed
 from is replaced by directly binding the upstream project as our
 submodule.  Glitches on minority platforms are still being worked out.

 Will keep in 'pu'.


* bp/fsmonitor (2017-06-12) 6 commits
 - fsmonitor: add a sample query-fsmonitor hook script for Watchman
 - fsmonitor: add documentation for the fsmonitor extension.
 - fsmonitor: add test cases for fsmonitor extension
 - fsmonitor: teach git to optionally utilize a file system monitor to speed up detecting new or changed files.
 - dir: make lookup_untracked() available outside of dir.c
 - bswap: add 64 bit endianness helper get_be64

 We learned to talk to watchman to speed up "git status".

 No more comments or updates?


* sb/diff-color-move (2017-06-30) 26 commits
 - diff: document the new --color-moved setting
 - diff.c: add dimming to moved line detection
 - diff.c: color moved lines differently, plain mode

 - diff.c: emit_diff_symbol learns DIFF_SYMBOL_WORDS[_PORCELAIN]
 - diff.c: migrate emit_line_checked to use emit_diff_symbol
 - diff.c: emit_diff_symbol learns DIFF_SYMBOL_NO_LF_EOF
 - diff.c: emit_diff_symbol learns DIFF_SYMBOL_CONTEXT_FRAGINFO
 - diff.c: emit_diff_symbol learns DIFF_SYMBOL_CONTEXT_MARKER
 - diff.c: introduce emit_diff_symbol
 - diff.c: factor out diff_flush_patch_all_file_pairs
 - diff.c: move line ending check into emit_hunk_header
 - diff.c: readability fix
 - Merge branch 'sb/hashmap-customize-comparison' into sb/diff-color-move
 (this branch uses sb/hashmap-customize-comparison.)

 "git diff" has been taught to optionally paint new lines that are
 the same as deleted lines elsewhere differently from genuinely new
 lines.

 Looking good.

 objects that are in use only in other worktrees to be subject to
 garbage collection.
