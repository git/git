What's cooking in git.git (Jun 2011, #05; Thu, 30)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.

Now that 1.7.6 is out, 'next' has been rewound and rebuilt to make its
history appear a bit cleaner.

Also I updated the order of topics in 'pu' to have the ones that are
scheduled for 'next' early in the sequence (and fixes and documentation
updates come earlier than new features), and pushing the stalled ones down
to the very end.

The tip of 'pu' is broken with respect to t7610 as of today.
