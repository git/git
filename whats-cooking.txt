What's cooking in git.git (Jan 2020, #02; Sat, 4)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

After the topics marked to be merged to 'master' go in, the tip of
the master will hopefully be very close to the final release.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

* ag/edit-todo-drop-check (2019-12-06) 2 commits
 - rebase-interactive: warn if commit is dropped with `rebase --edit-todo'
 - sequencer: move check_todo_list_from_file() to rebase-interactive.c

 Allow the rebase.missingCommitsCheck configuration to kick in when
 "rebase --edit-todo" and "rebase --continue" restarts the procedure.

 Broken.

* es/pathspec-f-f-grep (2019-12-13) 1 commit
 - grep: support the --pathspec-from-file option

 "git grep" learned the "--pathspec-from-file" command line
 option.

 Waiting for review responses.

* at/rebase-fork-point-regression-fix (2019-12-09) 1 commit
 - rebase: fix --fork-point with short refname

 The "--fork-point" mode of "git rebase" regressed when the command
 was rewritten in C back in 2.20 era, which has been corrected.

 Was waiting for discussion to settle.

* ma/config-bool-valex (2019-11-14) 8 commits
 - builtin/config: die if "value_regex" doesn't canonicalize as boolean
 - builtin/config: warn if "value_regex" doesn't canonicalize as boolean
 - builtin/config: canonicalize "value_regex" with `--type=bool-or-int`
 - builtin/config: canonicalize "value_regex" with `--type=bool`
 - builtin/config: collect "value_regexp" data in a struct
 - builtin/config: extract `handle_value_regex()` from `get_value()`
 - t1300: modernize part of script
 - config: make `git_parse_maybe_bool_text()` public

 "git config" can be told to affect the existing entries that
 "match" the given value via its value_regex argument.  It learned
 to normalize the value set in the configuration and the value given
 from the command line before computing they "match", e.g. "true" in
 the configuration file can now match with "yes" given from the
 command line.

 Needs a bit more work?

* mt/threaded-grep-in-object-store (2019-10-02) 11 commits
 - grep: move driver pre-load out of critical section
 - grep: re-enable threads in non-worktree case
 - grep: protect packed_git [re-]initialization
 - grep: allow submodule functions to run in parallel
 - submodule-config: add skip_if_read option to repo_read_gitmodules()
 - grep: replace grep_read_mutex by internal obj read lock
 - object-store: allow threaded access to object reading
 - replace-object: make replace operations thread-safe
 - grep: fix racy calls in grep_objects()
 - grep: fix race conditions at grep_submodule()
 - grep: fix race conditions on userdiff calls

 Traditionally, we avoided threaded grep while searching in objects
 (as opposed to files in the working tree) as accesses to the object
 layer is not thread-safe.  This limitation is getting lifted.

 Expecting a reroll.

* vn/reset-deleted-ita (2019-07-26) 1 commit
 - reset: unstage empty deleted ita files

 "git reset HEAD [<pathspec>]" did not reset an empty file that was
 added with the intent-to-add bit.

 Expecting a reroll.


* jn/unknown-index-extensions (2018-11-21) 2 commits
 - index: offer advice for unknown index extensions
 - index: do not warn about unrecognized extensions

 A bit too alarming warning given when unknown index extensions
 exist is getting revamped.

 Expecting a reroll.


* jc/format-patch-delay-message-id (2019-04-05) 1 commit
 - format-patch: move message-id and related headers to the end

 The location "git format-patch --thread" adds the Message-Id:
 header in the series of header fields has been moved down, which
 may help working around a suspected bug in GMail MSA, reported at
 <CAHk-=whP1stFZNAaJiMi5eZ9rj0MRt20Y_yHVczZPH+O01d+sA@mail.gmail.com>

 Waiting for feedback to see if it truly helps.
 Needs tests.


* js/protocol-advertise-multi (2018-12-28) 1 commit
 - protocol: advertise multiple supported versions

 The transport layer has been updated so that the protocol version
 used can be negotiated between the parties, by the initiator
 listing the protocol versions it is willing to talk, and the other
 side choosing from one of them.

 Expecting a reroll.

* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2018-10-15) 1 commit
 - zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

* ds/sparse-list-in-cone-mode (2019-12-30) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-01-04 at e1a174647e)
 + sparse-checkout: document interactions with submodules

  (merged to 'next' on 2020-01-04 at fab9964f10)
 + sha1-file: remove OBJECT_INFO_SKIP_CACHED

 has_object_file() said "no" given an object registered to the
 system via pretend_object_file(), making it inconsistent with
 read_object_file(), causing lazy fetch to attempt fetching an
 empty tree from promisor remotes.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* ds/commit-graph-set-size-mult (2020-01-02) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-01-04 at 71ea739a6c)
 + commit-graph: prefer default size_mult when given zero

 The code to write split commit-graph file(s) upon fetching computed
 bogus value for the parameter used in splitting the resulting
 files, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.

  (merged to 'next' on 2019-12-30 at e26700d582)
 + commit: honor advice.statusHints when rejecting an empty commit

 "git commit" gives output similar to "git status" when there is
 nothing to commit, but without honoring the advise.statusHints
 configuration variable, which has been corrected.

 + fetch test: avoid use of "VAR= cmd" with a shell function
 (this branch is used by jn/promote-proto2-to-default.)

 The test-lint machinery knew to check "VAR=VAL shell_function"
 construct, but did not check "VAR= shell_funciton", which has been
 corrected.

 Will cook in 'next'.


* js/add-p-leftover-bits (2019-12-24) 9 commits
 - ci: include the built-in `git add -i` in the `linux-gcc` job
 - built-in add -p: handle Escape sequences more efficiently
 - built-in add -p: handle Escape sequences in interactive.singlekey mode
 - built-in add -p: respect the `interactive.singlekey` config setting
 - terminal: add a new function to read a single keystroke
 - terminal: accommodate Git for Windows' default terminal
 - terminal: make the code of disable_echo() reusable
 - built-in add -p: handle diff.algorithm

 (this branch uses js/patch-mode-in-others-in-c.)

 The final leg of rewriting "add -i/-p" in C.

* js/mingw-loosen-overstrict-tree-entry-checks (2020-01-02) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-01-02 at 3088a0ccf1)
 + mingw: only test index entries for backslashes, not tree entries

 An earlier update to Git for Windows declared that a tree object is
 invalid if it has a path component with backslash in it, which was
 overly strict, which has been corrected.  The only protection the
 Windows users need is to prevent such path (or any path that their
 filesystem cannot check out) from entering the index.

* pb/clarify-line-log-doc (2019-12-26) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-12-30 at 7a4e15a436)

 + doc: log, gitk: document accepted line-log diff formats

 Doc update.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* pw/advise-rebase-skip (2019-12-06) 9 commits
 - rebase -i: leave CHERRY_PICK_HEAD when there are conflicts
 - rebase: fix advice when a fixup creates an empty commit
 - commit: give correct advice for empty commit during a rebase
 - commit: encapsulate determine_whence() for sequencer
 - commit: use enum value for multiple cherry-picks
 - sequencer: write CHERRY_PICK_HEAD for reword and edit
 - cherry-pick: check commit error messages
 - cherry-pick: add test for `--skip` advice in `git commit`
 - t3404: use test_cmp_rev

 The mechanism to prevent "git commit" from making an empty commit
 or amending during an interrupted cherry-pick was broken during the
 rewrite of "git rebase" in C, which has been corrected.

 What's the status of this one?
 The tip two are still RFC.


* js/patch-mode-in-others-in-c (2019-12-21) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-12-30 at a767b89288)

 + built-in stash: use the built-in `git add -p` if so configured
 + legacy stash -p: respect the add.interactive.usebuiltin setting
 + built-in add -p: implement the "stash" and "reset" patch modes
 + built-in add -p: prepare for patch modes other than "stage"
 (this branch is used by js/add-p-leftover-bits.)

 + ewah/bitmap: introduce bitmap_word_alloc()
 + packfile: expose get_delta_base()
 + builtin/pack-objects: report reused packfile objects

 The way "git pack-objects" reuses objects stored in existing pack
 to generate its result has been improved.

 Hold.  There is an update to these patches that currently are on 'next'.

* js/advise-rebase-skip (2019-10-23) 3 commits
 . commit: give correct advice for empty commit during a rebase
 . sequencer: export the function to get the path of `.git/rebase-merge/`
 . cherry-pick: add test for `--skip` advice in `git commit`

 The logic used in "git commit" to give hints and errors depending
 on what operation was in progress learned to distinguish rebase and
 cherry-pick better.
