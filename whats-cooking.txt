What's cooking in git.git (Mar 2014, #03; Fri, 14)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.

More topics merged to 'master', some of which have been cooking
before the v1.9.0 final release.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

[Graduated to "master"]

* ak/gitweb-fit-image (2014-02-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-06 at ba8cb50)
 + gitweb: Avoid overflowing page body frame with large images

 Instead of allowing an <img> to be shown in whatever size, force
 scaling it to fit on the page with max-height/max-width css style
 attributes.


* da/difftool-git-files (2014-03-05) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-06 at a563ec1)
 + t7800: add a difftool test for .git-files
 + difftool: support repositories with .git-files

 "git difftool" misbehaved when the repository is bound to the
 working tree with the ".git file" mechanism, where a textual
 file ".git" tells us where it is.


* jc/check-attr-honor-working-tree (2014-02-06) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-06 at 960d679)
 + check-attr: move to the top of working tree when in non-bare repository
 + t0003: do not chdir the whole test process

 "git check-attr" when (trying to) work on a repository with a
 working tree did not work well when the working tree was specified
 via --work-tree (and obviously with --git-dir).

 The command also works in a bare repository but it reads from the
 (possibly stale, irrelevant and/or nonexistent) index, which may
 need to be fixed to read from HEAD, but that is a completely
 separate issue.  As a related tangent to this separate issue, we
 may want to also fix "check-ignore", which refuses to work in a
 bare repository, to also operate in a bare one.


* jh/note-trees-record-blobs (2014-02-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-06 at f46852d)
 + notes: disallow reusing non-blob as a note object

 "git notes -C <blob>" should not take an object that is not a blob.


* jk/commit-dates-parsing-fix (2014-03-07) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-07 at 01e9d92)
 + show_ident_date: fix tz range check
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-06 at dd641e2)
 + log: do not segfault on gmtime errors
 + log: handle integer overflow in timestamps
 + date: check date overflow against time_t
 + fsck: report integer overflow in author timestamps
 + t4212: test bogus timestamps with git-log

 Codepaths that parse timestamps in commit objects have been
 tightened.


* jk/doc-coding-guideline (2014-02-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-06 at c33101d)
 + CodingGuidelines: mention C whitespace rules

 Elaborate on a style niggle that has been part of "mimic existing
 code".


* jk/http-no-curl-easy (2014-02-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-06 at 56d3f6f)
 + http: never use curl_easy_perform

 Uses of curl's "multi" interface and "easy" interface do not mix
 well when we attempt to reuse outgoing connections.  Teach the RPC
 over http code, used in the smart HTTP transport, not to use the
 "easy" interface.


* jk/janitorial-fixes (2014-02-18) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-06 at dac2de6)
 + open_istream(): do not dereference NULL in the error case
 + builtin/mv: don't use memory after free
 + utf8: use correct type for values in interval table
 + utf8: fix iconv error detection
 + notes-utils: handle boolean notes.rewritemode correctly


* jk/remote-pushremote-config-reading (2014-02-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-06 at 9e71ecb)
 + remote: handle pushremote config in any order

 "git push" did not pay attention to branch.*.pushremote if it is
 defined earlier than remote.pushdefault; the order of these two
 variables in the configuration file should not matter, but it did
 by mistake.


* jl/doc-submodule-update-checkout (2014-02-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-06 at 8cdf5cb)
 + submodule update: consistently document the '--checkout' option

 Add missing documentation for "submodule update --checkout".


* jm/stash-doc-k-for-keep (2014-02-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-06 at ddd8e48)
 + stash doc: mention short form -k in save description


* jn/am-doc-hooks (2014-02-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-06 at 5c1c372)
 + am doc: add a pointer to relevant hooks


* jn/bisect-coding-style (2014-03-03) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-06 at e1de2a5)
 + git-bisect.sh: fix a few style issues


* ks/config-file-stdin (2014-02-18) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-06 at 3e77313)
 + config: teach "git config --file -" to read from the standard input
 + config: change git_config_with_options() interface
 + builtin/config.c: rename check_blob_write() -> check_write()
 + config: disallow relative include paths from blobs

 "git config" learned to read from the standard input when "-" is
 given as the value to its "--file" parameter (attempting an
 operation to update the configuration in the standard input of
 course is rejected).


* lb/contrib-contacts-looser-diff-parsing (2014-02-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-06 at 1cc4ffe)
 + git-contacts: do not fail parsing of good diffs


* mh/object-code-cleanup (2014-02-24) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-06 at d6b3867)
 + sha1_file.c: document a bunch of functions defined in the file
 + sha1_file_name(): declare to return a const string
 + find_pack_entry(): document last_found_pack
 + replace_object: use struct members instead of an array


* mh/replace-refs-variable-rename (2014-02-28) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-06 at 70bf89b)
 + Document some functions defined in object.c
 + Add docstrings for lookup_replace_object() and do_lookup_replace_object()
 + rename read_replace_refs to check_replace_refs


* nd/gitignore-trailing-whitespace (2014-03-11) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-11 at ccdba51)
 + t0008: skip trailing space test on Windows
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-06 at f649a34)
 + dir: ignore trailing spaces in exclude patterns
 + dir: warn about trailing spaces in exclude patterns

 Trailing whitespaces in .gitignore files, unless they are quoted
 for fnmatch(3), e.g. "path\ ", are warned and ignored.  Strictly
 speaking, this is a backward incompatible change, but very unlikely
 to bite any sane user and adjusting should be obvious and easy.


* nd/i18n-progress (2014-02-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-06 at 600fd3e)
 + i18n: mark all progress lines for translation

 The progress indicators from various time-consuming commands have
 been marked for i18n/l10n.


* nd/no-more-fnmatch (2014-02-20) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-06 at f0b8f12)
 + actually remove compat fnmatch source code
 + stop using fnmatch (either native or compat)
 + Revert "test-wildmatch: add "perf" command to compare wildmatch and fnmatch"
 + use wildmatch() directly without fnmatch() wrapper

 We started using wildmatch() in place of fnmatch(3); complete the
 process and stop using fnmatch(3).


* nd/reset-setup-worktree (2014-02-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-06 at d93f20a)
 + reset: optionally setup worktree and refresh index on --mixed

 "git reset" needs to refresh the index when working in a working
 tree (it can also be used to match the index to the HEAD in an
 otherwise bare repository), but it failed to set up the working
 tree properly, causing GIT_WORK_TREE to be ignored.


* nd/strbuf-inline-styles (2014-03-03) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-06 at 70b5e56)
 + strbuf: style fix -- top opening bracket on a separate line


* rt/help-pretty-prints-cmd-names (2014-02-28) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-06 at fc607dc)
 + help.c: rename function "pretty_print_string_list"


* rt/links-for-asciidoctor (2014-02-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-06 at 547f13d)
 + Documentation: fix documentation AsciiDoc links for external urls


* sg/archive-restrict-remote (2014-02-28) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-06 at 5fe8998)
 + add uploadarchive.allowUnreachable option
 + docs: clarify remote restrictions for git-upload-archive

 Allow loosening remote "git archive" invocation security check that
 refuses to serve tree-ish not at the tip of any ref.


* sh/write-pack-file-warning-message-fix (2014-03-03) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-06 at 1470b0a)
 + write_pack_file: use correct variable in diagnostic
 (this branch is used by sh/finish-tmp-packfile.)

 A warning from "git pack-objects" were generated by referring to an
 incorrect variable when forming the filename that we had trouble
 with.


* sr/add--interactive-term-readkey (2014-03-03) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-06 at 9ca7af8)
 + git-add--interactive: warn if module for interactive.singlekey is missing
 + git-config: document interactive.singlekey requires Term::ReadKey


* ss/completion-rec-sub-fetch-push (2014-02-11) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-06 at b5bf463)
 + completion: teach --recurse-submodules to fetch, pull and push


* ta/parse-commit-with-skip-prefix (2014-03-04) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-06 at 0244988)
 + commit.c: use skip_prefix() instead of starts_with()


* tg/index-v4-format (2014-02-24) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-06 at d4ca5a8)
 + read-cache: add index.version config variable
 + test-lib: allow setting the index format version
 + introduce GIT_INDEX_VERSION environment variable


* tr/diff-submodule-no-reuse-worktree (2014-02-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-06 at ac8008f)
 + diff: do not reuse_worktree_file for submodules

 "git diff --external-diff" incorrectly fed the submodule directory
 in the working tree to the external diff driver when it knew it is
 the same as one of the versions being compared.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* jn/wt-status (2014-03-12) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-14 at 8ac862c)
 + wt-status: lift the artificual "at least 20 columns" floor
 + wt-status: i18n of section labels
 + wt-status: extract the code to compute width for labels
 + wt-status: make full label string to be subject to l10n

 Unify the codepaths that format new/modified/changed sections and
 conflicted paths in the "git status" output and make it possible to
 properly internationalize their output.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* es/sh-i18n-envsubst (2014-03-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-14 at e4d5603)
 + sh-i18n--envsubst: retire unused string_list_member()

 Will merge to 'master'.


* mh/remove-subtree-long-pathname-fix (2014-03-13) 2 commits
 - entry.c: fix possible buffer overflow in remove_subtree()
 - checkout_entry(): use the strbuf throughout the function

 Will merge to 'next'.


* nd/indent-fix-connect-c (2014-03-13) 1 commit
 - connect.c: SP after "}", not TAB

 Will merge to 'next'.


* pw/branch-config-message (2014-03-13) 1 commit
 - install_branch_config(): simplify verbose messages logic

 Among the many attempts to microproject #8, this seemed to be the
 most "done" among the table based ones; I however tend to think
 that the original with minimum refactoring would be easier to read.


* ys/fsck-commit-parsing (2014-03-13) 2 commits
 - fsck.c:fsck_commit(): use skip_prefix() to verify and skip constant
 - fsck.c:fsck_ident(): ident points at a const string


* jk/warn-on-object-refname-ambiguity (2014-03-13) 4 commits
 - rev-list: disable object/refname ambiguity check with --stdin
 - cat-file: restore warn_on_object_refname_ambiguity flag
 - cat-file: fix a minor memory leak in batch_objects
 - cat-file: refactor error handling of batch_objects

 Will merge to 'next'.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* bc/blame-crlf-test (2014-02-18) 1 commit
 - blame: add a failing test for a CRLF issue.

 I have a feeling that a fix for this should be fairly isolated and
 trivial (it should be just the matter of paying attention to the
 crlf settings when synthesizing the fake commit)---perhaps somebody
 can squash in a fix to this?


* ap/remote-hg-skip-null-bookmarks (2014-01-02) 1 commit
 - remote-hg: do not fail on invalid bookmarks

 Reported to break tests ($gmane/240005)
 Expecting a reroll.


* jk/makefile (2014-02-05) 16 commits
 - FIXUP
 - move LESS/LV pager environment to Makefile
 - Makefile: teach scripts to include make variables
 - FIXUP
 - Makefile: auto-build C strings from make variables
 - Makefile: drop *_SQ variables
 - FIXUP
 - Makefile: add c-quote helper function
 - Makefile: introduce sq function for shell-quoting
 - Makefile: always create files via make-var
 - Makefile: store GIT-* sentinel files in MAKE/
 - Makefile: prefer printf to echo for GIT-*
 - Makefile: use tempfile/mv strategy for GIT-*
 - Makefile: introduce make-var helper function
 - Makefile: fix git-instaweb dependency on gitweb
 - Makefile: drop USE_GETTEXT_SCHEME from GIT-CFLAGS

 Simplify the Makefile rules and macros that exist primarily for
 quoting purposes, and make it easier to robustly express the
 dependency rules.

 Expecting a reroll.


* kb/fast-hashmap-pack-struct (2014-02-24) 1 commit
 - hashmap.h: make sure map entries are tightly packed

 I am inclined to drop this; an alternative is to replace it with
 the "more portable" one that uses #pragma, which I am willing to
 try doing so on 'pu', though.


* po/everyday-doc (2014-01-27) 1 commit
 - Make 'git help everyday' work

 This may make the said command to emit something, but the source is
 not meant to be formatted into a manual pages to begin with, and
 also its contents are a bit stale.  It may be a good first step in
 the right direction, but needs more work to at least get the
 mark-up right before public consumption.

 Will hold.


* jk/branch-at-publish-rebased (2014-01-17) 5 commits
 - t1507 (rev-parse-upstream): fix typo in test title
 - implement @{publish} shorthand
 - branch_get: provide per-branch pushremote pointers
 - branch_get: return early on error
 - sha1_name: refactor upstream_mark

 Give an easier access to the tracking branches from "other" side in
 a triangular workflow by introducing B@{publish} that works in a
 similar way to how B@{upstream} does.

 Meant to be used as a basis for whatever Ram wants to build on.

 Will hold.


* rb/merge-prepare-commit-msg-hook (2014-01-10) 4 commits
 - merge: drop unused arg from abort_commit method signature
 - merge: make prepare_to_commit responsible for write_merge_state
 - t7505: ensure cleanup after hook blocks merge
 - t7505: add missing &&

 Expose more merge states (e.g. $GIT_DIR/MERGE_MODE) to hooks that
 run during "git merge".  The log message stresses too much on one
 hook, prepare-commit-msg, but it would equally apply to other hooks
 like post-merge, I think.

 Waiting for a reroll.


* jl/submodule-recursive-checkout (2013-12-26) 5 commits
 - Teach checkout to recursively checkout submodules
 - submodule: teach unpack_trees() to update submodules
 - submodule: teach unpack_trees() to repopulate submodules
 - submodule: teach unpack_trees() to remove submodule contents
 - submodule: prepare for recursive checkout of submodules

 Expecting a reroll.


* jc/graph-post-root-gap (2013-12-30) 3 commits
 - WIP: document what we want at the end
 - graph: remove unused code a bit
 - graph: stuff the current commit into graph->columns[]

 This was primarily a RFH ($gmane/239580).


* fc/completion (2013-12-09) 1 commit
 - completion: fix completion of certain aliases

 SZEDER Gábor noticed that this breaks "git -c var=val alias" and
 also suggested a better description of the change.

 Has been stalled for a while without much comments from anybody
 interested.

 Will discard.


* mo/subtree-split-updates (2013-12-10) 3 commits
 - subtree: add --edit option
 - subtree: allow --squash and --message with push
 - subtree: support split --rejoin --squash

 Has been stalled for a while without much comments from anybody
 interested.

 Will discard.


* hv/submodule-ignore-fix (2013-12-06) 4 commits
 - disable complete ignorance of submodules for index <-> HEAD diff
 - always show committed submodules in summary after commit
 - teach add -f option for ignored submodules
 - fix 'git add' to skip submodules configured as ignored

 Teach "git add" to be consistent with "git status" when changes to
 submodules are set to be ignored, to avoid surprises after checking
 with "git status" to see there isn't any change to be further added
 and then see that "git add ." adds changes to them.

 I think a reroll is coming, so this may need to be replaced, but I
 needed some practice with heavy conflict resolution.  It conflicts
 with two changes to "git add" that have been scheduled for Git 2.0
 quite badly, and I think I got the resolution right this time.

 Waiting for a reroll.


* jc/create-directories-microopt (2013-11-11) 1 commit
 - checkout: most of the time we have good leading directories

 Of unknown value until tested on non-Linux platforms (especially
 Windows).

 Will discard.


* jt/commit-fixes-footer (2013-10-30) 1 commit
 - commit: Add -f, --fixes <commit> option to add Fixes: line

 There is an ongoing discussion around this topic; in general I am
 fairly negative on a new feature that is too narrow and prefer a
 more generic solution that can be tailored for specific needs, as
 many people stated in the thread.

 cc/interpret-trailers could be such a generic solution (although
 there don't seem to be much concensus yet).

 Will discard.


* np/pack-v4 (2013-09-18) 90 commits
 . packv4-parse.c: add tree offset caching
 . t1050: replace one instance of show-index with verify-pack
 . index-pack, pack-objects: allow creating .idx v2 with .pack v4
 . unpack-objects: decode v4 trees
 . unpack-objects: allow to save processed bytes to a buffer
 - ...

 Nico and Duy advancing the eternal vaporware pack-v4.  This is here
 primarily for wider distribution of the preview edition.

 Temporarily ejected from 'pu', to try out jk/pack-bitmap, which
 this topic conflicts with.


* mf/graph-show-root (2013-10-25) 1 commit
 . graph.c: mark root commit differently

 In a repository with multiple-roots, "log --graph", especially with
 "--oneline", does not give the reader enough visual cue to see
 where one line of history ended and a separate history began.

 This is the version that marks the roots 'x' when they would have
 been marked as '*'; Keshav Kini suggested an alternative of giving
 an extra blank line after every root, which I tend to think is a
 better approach to the problem.

 Will discard.


* tg/perf-lib-test-perf-cleanup (2013-09-19) 2 commits
 - perf-lib: add test_perf_cleanup target
 - perf-lib: split starting the test from the execution

 Add test_perf_cleanup shell function to the perf suite, that allows
 the script writers to define a test with a clean-up action.

 Will hold.


* yt/shortened-rename (2013-10-18) 2 commits
 - SQUASH??? style fixes and s/omit/shorten/ where appropriate
 - diff.c: keep arrow(=>) on show_stats()'s shortened filename part to make rename visible

 Attempts to give more weight on the fact that a filepair represents
 a rename than showing substring of the actual path when diffstat
 lines are not wide enough.

 I am not sure if that is solving a right problem, though.

 Will discard.


* rv/send-email-cache-generated-mid (2013-08-21) 2 commits
 - git-send-email: Cache generated message-ids, use them when prompting
 - git-send-email: add optional 'choices' parameter to the ask sub

 Will discard.


* rj/read-default-config-in-show-ref-pack-refs (2013-06-17) 3 commits
 - ### DONTMERGE: needs better explanation on what config they need
 - pack-refs.c: Add missing call to git_config()
 - show-ref.c: Add missing call to git_config()

 The changes themselves are probably good, but it is unclear what
 basic setting needs to be read for which exact operation.

 Will discard, tired of waiting for clarification.
 $gmane/228294


* jc/format-patch (2013-04-22) 2 commits
 - format-patch: --inline-single
 - format-patch: rename "no_inline" field

 A new option to send a single patch to the standard output to be
 appended at the bottom of a message.  I personally have no need for
 this, but it was easy enough to cobble together.  Tests, docs and
 stripping out more MIMEy stuff are left as exercises to interested
 parties.


* jk/gitweb-utf8 (2013-04-08) 4 commits
 - gitweb: Fix broken blob action parameters on blob/commitdiff pages
 - gitweb: Don't append ';js=(0|1)' to external links
 - gitweb: Make feed title valid utf8
 - gitweb: Fix utf8 encoding for blob_plain, blobdiff_plain, commitdiff_plain, and patch

 Various fixes to gitweb.

 Drew Northup volunteered to take a look into this ($gmane/226216)
 but nothing seems to have happened since then.

 Will discard.


* jc/show-branch (2013-06-07) 5 commits
 - show-branch: use commit slab to represent bitflags of arbitrary width
 - show-branch.c: remove "all_mask"
 - show-branch.c: abstract out "flags" operation
 - show-branch.c: lift all_mask/all_revs to a global static
 - show-branch.c: update comment style

 Waiting for the final step to lift the hard-limit before sending it out.

 discarding the stash to avoid information loss.  Be more explicit
 in the error message.

  (merged to 'next' on 2014-03-14 at ff375fc)
 + skip_prefix(): scan prefix only once

 Update implementation of skip_prefix() to scan only once; given
 that most "prefix" arguments to the inline function are constant
 strings whose strlen() can be determined at the compile time, this
 might actually make things worse with a compiler with sufficient
 intelligence.

* ks/tree-diff-nway (2014-03-04) 19 commits
 - combine-diff: speed it up, by using multiparent diff tree-walker directly
 - tree-diff: rework diff_tree() to generate diffs for multiparent cases as well
 - Portable alloca for Git
 - tree-diff: reuse base str(buf) memory on sub-tree recursion
 - tree-diff: no need to call "full" diff_tree_sha1 from show_path()
 - tree-diff: rework diff_tree interface to be sha1 based
 - tree-diff: diff_tree() should now be static
 - tree-diff: remove special-case diff-emitting code for empty-tree cases
 - tree-diff: simplify tree_entry_pathcmp
 - tree-diff: show_path prototype is not needed anymore
 - tree-diff: rename compare_tree_entry -> tree_entry_pathcmp
 - tree-diff: move all action-taking code out of compare_tree_entry()
 - tree-diff: don't assume compare_tree_entry() returns -1,0,1
 - tree-diff: consolidate code for emitting diffs and recursion in one place
 - tree-diff: show_tree() is not needed
 - tree-diff: no need to pass match to skip_uninteresting()
 - tree-diff: no need to manually verify that there is no mode change for a path
 - combine-diff: move changed-paths scanning logic into its own function
 - combine-diff: move show_log_first logic/action out of paths scanning

 Instead of running N pair-wise diff-trees when inspecting a
 N-parent merge, find the set of paths that were touched by walking
 N+1 trees in parallel.  These set of paths can then be turned into
 N pair-wise diff-tree results to be processed through rename
 detections and such.  And N=2 case nicely degenerates to the usual
 2-way diff-tree, which is very nice.


* nd/log-show-linear-break (2014-02-10) 1 commit

 Attempts to show where a single-strand-of-pearls break in "git log"
 output.

* tr/remerge-diff (2014-02-26) 5 commits
 . log --remerge-diff: show what the conflict resolution changed
 . name-hash: allow dir hashing even when !ignore_case
 . merge-recursive: allow storing conflict hunks in index
 . revision: fold all merge diff variants into an enum merge_diff_mode
 . combine-diff: do not pass revs->dense_combined_merges redundantly
 (this branch uses tr/merge-recursive-index-only.)

 "log -p" output learns a new way to let users inspect a merge
 commit by showing the differences between the automerged result
 with conflicts the person who recorded the merge would have seen
 and the final conflict resolution that was recorded in the merge.

 RFC.  This latest round clashes with the kb/fast-hashmap topic in
 'master'.

* bl/blame-full-history (2014-01-14) 1 commit
 - blame: new option --prefer-first to better handle merged cherry-picks

 By disabling the tree-same optimization (which is consistent with
 the default behaviour of "git log"-family of commands), make "git
 blame" sometimes produce different result from the original code.

 Because the "git blame" output can give result for each line from
 only one lineage of the history, however, this can be only useful
 when you are lucky---unlike "--full-history" of "git log"-family,
 where we can show commits from both lineages of histories with an
 equal weight.  See $gmane/240392 for more detailed discussion.

 Will discard.
