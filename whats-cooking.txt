Subject: What's cooking in git.git (Jun 2018, #07; Thu, 28)
X-master-at: e3331758f12da22f4103eec7efe1b5304a9be5e9

What's cooking in git.git (Jun 2018, #07; Thu, 28)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

The tip of 'next' has been rewound and it currently has only 4
topics.  Quite a many topics are cooking in 'pu' and need to be
sifted into good bins (for 'next') and the remainder.  Help is
appreciated in that area ;-)

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

[Graduated to "master"]

* ab/refspec-init-fix (2018-06-11) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-06-13 at 91d71d8435)
 + refspec: initalize `refspec_item` in `valid_fetch_refspec()`
 + refspec: add back a refspec_item_init() function
 + refspec: s/refspec_item_init/&_or_die/g

 Make refspec parsing codepath more robust.


* as/safecrlf-quiet-fix (2018-06-11) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-06-13 at b163674843)
 + config.c: fix regression for core.safecrlf false

 Fix for 2.17-era regression around `core.safecrlf`.


* jc/clean-after-sanity-tests (2018-06-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-06-22 at 2df77b8af9)
 + tests: clean after SANITY tests

 test cleanup.


* jh/partial-clone (2018-06-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-06-13 at 818f864b0c)
 + list-objects: check if filter is NULL before using

 The recent addition of "partial clone" experimental feature kicked
 in when it shouldn't, namely, when there is no partial-clone filter
 defined even if extensions.partialclone is set.


* jk/fetch-all-peeled-fix (2018-06-13) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-06-13 at 1333bb9d90)
 + fetch-pack: test explicitly that --all can fetch tag references pointing to non-commits
 + fetch-pack: don't try to fetch peel values with --all

 "git fetch-pack --all" used to unnecessarily fail upon seeing an
 annotated tag that points at an object other than a commit.


* ms/send-pack-honor-config (2018-06-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-06-13 at e2cd933715)
 + builtin/send-pack: populate the default configs

 "git send-pack --signed" (hence "git push --signed" over the http
 transport) did not read user ident from the config mechanism to
 determine whom to sign the push certificate as, which has been
 corrected.


* nd/completion-negation (2018-06-11) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-06-19 at a3be59b450)
 + completion: collapse extra --no-.. options
 + completion: suppress some -no- options
 + parse-options: option to let --git-completion-helper show negative form

 Continuing with the idea to programmatically enumerate various
 pieces of data required for command line completion, the codebase
 has been taught to enumerate options prefixed with "--no-" to
 negate them.


* pw/add-p-recount (2018-06-11) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-06-19 at 1880ecc3f1)
 + add -p: fix counting empty context lines in edited patches

 When user edits the patch in "git add -p" and the user's editor is
 set to strip trailing whitespaces indiscriminately, an empty line
 that is unchanged in the patch would become completely empty
 (instead of a line with a sole SP on it).  The code introduced in
 Git 2.17 timeframe failed to parse such a patch, but now it learned
 to notice the situation and cope with it.


* sb/fix-fetching-moved-submodules (2018-06-14) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-06-22 at 16039dc62a)
 + t5526: test recursive submodules when fetching moved submodules
 + submodule: fix NULL correctness in renamed broken submodules

 The code to try seeing if a fetch is necessary in a submodule
 during a fetch with --recurse-submodules got confused when the path
 to the submodule was changed in the range of commits in the
 superproject, sometimes showing "(null)".  This has been corrected.


* sg/gpg-tests-fix (2018-06-11) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-06-13 at f3a05f1c41)
 + tests: make forging GPG signed commits and tags more robust
 + t7510-signed-commit: use 'test_must_fail'

 Some flaky tests have been fixed.


* tz/cred-netrc-cleanup (2018-06-18) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-06-22 at a471dd714c)
 + git-credential-netrc: make "all" default target of Makefile
 + git-credential-netrc: fix exit status when tests fail
 + git-credential-netrc: use in-tree Git.pm for tests
 + git-credential-netrc: minor whitespace cleanup in test script

 Build and test procedure for netrc credential helper (in contrib/)
 has been updated.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* ao/config-from-gitmodules (2018-06-26) 6 commits
 - submodule-config: reuse config_from_gitmodules in repo_read_gitmodules
 - submodule-config: pass repository as argument to config_from_gitmodules
 - submodule-config: make 'config_from_gitmodules' private
 - submodule-config: add helper to get 'update-clone' config from .gitmodules
 - submodule-config: add helper function to get 'fetch' config from .gitmodules
 - config: move config_from_gitmodules to submodule-config.c

 Tighten the API to make it harder to misuse in-tree .gitmodules
 file, even though it shares the same syntax with configuration
 files, to read random configuration items from it.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* as/sequencer-customizable-comment-char (2018-06-28) 1 commit
 - sequencer: use configured comment character

 Honor core.commentchar when preparing the list of commits to replay
 in "rebase -i".

 Docfix.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jt/connectivity-check-after-unshallow (2018-06-27) 1 commit
 - fetch: when deepening, check connectivity fully

 "git fetch" failed to correctly validate the set of objects it
 received when making a shallow history deeper, which has been
 corrected.


* jt/fetch-nego-tip (2018-06-27) 1 commit
 - fetch-pack: support negotiation tip whitelist
 (this branch uses jt/fetch-pack-negotiator.)

 "git fetch" learned a new option "--negotiation-tip" to limit the
 set of commits it tells the other end as "have", to reduce wasted
 bandwidth and cycles, which would be helpful when the receiving
 repository has a lot of refs that have little to do with the
 history at the remote it is fetching from.


* mb/filter-branch-optim (2018-06-26) 1 commit
 - filter-branch: skip commits present on --state-branch

 "git filter-branch" when used with the "--state-branch" option
 still attempted to rewrite the commits whose filtered result is
 known from the previous attempt (which is recorded on the state
 branch); the command has been corrected not to waste cycles doing
 so.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ms/core-icase-doc (2018-06-28) 1 commit
 - Documentation: declare "core.ignoreCase" as internal variable

 Clarify that setting core.ignoreCase to deviate from reality would
 not turn a case-incapable filesystem into a case-capable one.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* rj/submodule-fsck-skip (2018-06-27) 1 commit
 - fsck: check skiplist for object in fsck_blob()

 "fsck.skipList" did not prevent a blob object listed there from
 being inspected for is contents (e.g. we recently started to
 inspect the contents of ".gitmodules" for certain malicious
 patterns), which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* tb/grep-only-matching (2018-06-27) 3 commits
 - SQUASH??? emerg compilation fix
 - grep.c: teach 'git grep --only-matching'
 - grep.c: extract show_line_header()
 (this branch uses tb/grep-column.)

 "git grep" learned the "--only-matching" option.


* tz/exclude-doc-smallfixes (2018-06-27) 2 commits
 - dir.c: fix typos in core.excludesfile comment
 - gitignore.txt: clarify default core.excludesfile path

* pw/add-p-select (2018-03-16) 3 commits
 - add -p: optimize line selection for short hunks
 - add -p: allow line selection to be inverted
 - add -p: select individual hunk lines

 "git add -p" interactive interface learned to let users choose
 individual added/removed lines to be used in the operation, instead
 of accepting or rejecting a whole hunk.

 Expecting a reroll to reignite the discussion.

* jh/json-writer (2018-06-13) 1 commit
 - json_writer: new routines to create JSON data

 Preparatory code to later add json output for unspecified telemetry
 data.

 We do not add random code that does not have real users to our
 codebase, so let's have it wait until such a real code materializes
 before too long.


* hn/bisect-first-parent (2018-04-21) 1 commit
 - bisect: create 'bisect_flags' parameter in find_bisection()

 Preliminary code update to allow passing more flags down the
 bisection codepath in the future.

 We do not add random code that does not have real users to our
 codebase, so let's have it wait until such a real code materializes
 before too long.

 - fsmonitor: use fsmonitor data in `git diff`
 - fsmonitor: remove debugging lines from t/t7519-status-fsmonitor.sh

 I just rebased the topic to a newer base as it did not build
 standalone with the base I originally queued the topic on, but
 otherwise there is no update to address any of the review comments
 in the thread above---we are still waiting for a reroll.


* mk/http-backend-content-length (2018-06-11) 3 commits
 - http-backend: respect CONTENT_LENGTH for receive-pack
 - http-backend: respect CONTENT_LENGTH as specified by rfc3875
 - http-backend: cleanup writing to child process

 The http-backend (used for smart-http transport) used to slurp the
 whole input until EOF, without paying attention to CONTENT_LENGTH
 that is supplied in the environment and instead expecting the Web
 server to close the input stream.  This has been fixed.


* jk/drop-ancient-curl (2017-08-09) 5 commits
 - http: #error on too-old curl
 - curl: remove ifdef'd code never used with curl >=7.19.4
 - http: drop support for curl < 7.19.4
 - http: drop support for curl < 7.16.0
 - http: drop support for curl < 7.11.1

 Some code in http.c that has bitrot is being removed.

 Expecting a reroll.


* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2017-08-10) 1 commit
 . zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

 Needs resurrecting by making sure the fix is good and still applies
 (or adjusted to today's codebase).

 - upload-pack: implement ref-in-want
 - test-pkt-line: add unpack-sideband subcommand

 Protocol v2 has been updated to allow slightly out-of-sync set of
 servers to work together to serve a single client, which would be
 useful with load-balanced servers that talk smart HTTP transport.

 - t3422: new testcases for checking when incompatible options passed
 - git-rebase.sh: update help messages a bit
 - git-rebase.txt: document incompatible options

 "git rebase" behaved slightly differently depending on which one of

 - multi-pack-index: add format details
 - multi-pack-index: add design document

 When there are too many packfiles in a repository (which is not
 recommended), looking up an object in these would require
 consulting many pack .idx files; a new mechanism to have a single
 file that consolidates all of these .idx files is introduced.


* nd/use-the-index-compat-less (2018-06-25) 13 commits
 - wt-status.c: stop using index compat macros
 - sha1-name.c: stop using index compat macros
 - sequencer.c: stop using index compat macros
 - revision.c: stop using index compat macros
 - rerere.c: stop using index compat macros

 - diff.c: stop using index compat macros
 - diff-lib.c: stop using index compat macros
 - check-racy.c: stop using index compat macros
 - blame.c: stop using index compat macros
 - apply.c: stop using index compat macros

 Use of many convenience functions that operate on the_index
 "primary in-core index instance" have been rewritten to explicitly
 call the coutnerpart functions that take arbitrary index_state and
 pass the_index.

 I'd say that alone is a useless code churn, but people seem to be
 excited about the change, so it is queued here.

 - grep.c: expose {,inverted} match column in match_line()
 - Documentation/config.txt: camel-case lineNumber for consistency
 (this branch is used by tb/grep-only-matching.)

 "git grep" learned the "--column" option that gives not just the
 line number but the column number of the hit.

 Will merge to 'next'.

  (merged to 'next' on 2018-06-28 at 96e1a8dbd1)
 + submodule deinit: unset core.worktree
 + submodule: ensure core.worktree is set after update
 + submodule: unset core.worktree if no working tree is present

 Originally merged to 'next' on 2018-06-22

 "git submodule" did not correctly adjust core.worktree setting that
 indicates whether/where a submodule repository has its associated
 working tree across various state transitions, which has been
 corrected.

 - commit-graph: verify root tree OIDs
 - commit-graph: verify objects exist
 - commit-graph: verify corrupt OID fanout and lookup
 - commit-graph: verify required chunks are present

 - t5318-commit-graph.sh: use core.commitGraph

 "git fsck" learns to make sure the optional commit-graph file is in
 a sane state.

 Is this ready for 'next'?


* ma/wrapped-info (2018-05-28) 2 commits
 - usage: prefix all lines in `vreportf()`, not just the first
 - usage: extract `prefix_suffix_lines()` from `advise()`

 An attempt to help making multi-line messages fed to warning(),
 error(), and friends more easily translatable.

 Will discard and wait for a cleaned-up rewrite.

* jm/cache-entry-from-mem-pool (2018-06-28) 8 commits
 - block alloc: add validations around cache_entry lifecyle
 - block alloc: allocate cache entries from mem-pool
 - mem-pool: fill out functionality
 - mem-pool: add life cycle management functions
 - mem-pool: only search head block for available space
 - block alloc: add lifecycle APIs for cache_entry structs
 - read-cache: make_cache_entry should take object_id struct
 - read-cache: teach refresh_cache_entry() to take istate

 For a large tree, the index needs to hold many cache entries
 allocated on heap.  These cache entries are now allocated out of a
 dedicated memory pool to amortize malloc(3) overhead.

 "git tbdiff" that lets us compare individual patches in two
 iterations of a topic has been rewritten and made into a built-in
 command.

 Expecting a reroll.

* sb/diff-color-move-more (2018-06-25) 11 commits
 - diff: fix a sparse 'dubious one-bit signed bitfield' error
 - SQUASH??? t/4015 GETTEXT_POISON emergency fix
 - SQUASH????? Documentation breakage emergency fix
 - diff.c: add white space mode to move detection that allows indent changes

 - diff.c: decouple white space treatment from move detection algorithm
 - diff.c: add a blocks mode for moved code detection
 - diff.c: adjust hash function signature to match hashmap expectation
 - diff.c: do not pass diff options as keydata to hashmap
 - xdiff/xdiffi.c: remove unneeded function declarations
 - xdiff/xdiff.h: remove unused flags

 "git diff --color-moved" feature has further been tweaked.

 Needs to be cleaned-up with various fix-up bits applied inline.


* jk/branch-l-0-deprecation (2018-06-22) 3 commits
 - branch: deprecate "-l" option
 - t: switch "branch -l" to "branch --create-reflog"
 - t3200: unset core.logallrefupdates when testing reflog creation
 (this branch is used by jk/branch-l-1-repurpose.)

 The "-l" option in "git branch -l" is an unfortunate short-hand for
 "--create-reflog", but many users, both old and new, somehow expect
 it to be something else, perhaps "--list".  This step warns when "-l"
 is used as a short-hand for "--create-reflog" and warns about the
 future repurposing of the it when it is used.

 Will merge to 'next'.
