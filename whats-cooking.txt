What's cooking in git.git (Jul 2015, #02; Tue, 7)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.

As there is at least one new topic in 2.5-rc that has a real and
severe breakage (I haven't merged the fix for it to 'master' yet),
we may probably need to delay the final by at least a few weeks.

Projects from GSoC students and Ensimag students have also been a
pleasure to work with.  I'd have to say that this year is much
better than some previous years.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

[New Topics]

 - Documentation: move linked worktree description from checkout to worktree
 - Documentation/git-worktree: associate options with commands
 - Documentation/git-checkout: fix incorrect worktree prune command
 (this branch uses nd/multiple-work-trees.)

 Update to the "linked checkout" in 2.5.0-rc1; while I very much
 like what I see in this series, I think it does not work well with
 the date-based release schedule for v2.5, and as we've been
 labelling the feature with "experimental, UI will change" warning,
 I am tempted to cook this (or a reroll of it) in 'next' and shoot
 for a refined version of it in 2.6, rather than delaying 2.5 final.

 An alternative obviously is to slip 2.5 final for a few weeks,
 waiting for this and possibly other hotfix topics to mature.

 Undecided.


* jc/fix-alloc-sortbuf-in-index-pack (2015-07-04) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-07-06 at c05da06)
 + index-pack: fix allocation of sorted_by_pos array

 Another hotfix for what is in 2.5-rc but not in 2.4

 The alternative to slip 2.5 final for a few weeks starting to
 become more and more attractive...


* jc/unexport-git-pager-in-use-in-pager (2015-07-03) 1 commit
 - pager: do not leak "GIT_PAGER_IN_USE" to the pager

 When you say "!<ENTER>" while running say "git log", you'd confuse
 yourself in the resulting shell, that may look as if you took
 control back to the original shell you spawned "git log" from but
 that isn't what is happening.  To that new shell, we leaked
 GIT_PAGER_IN_USE environment variable that was meant as a local
 communication between the original "Git" and subprocesses that was
 spawned by it after we launched the pager, which caused many
 "interesting" things to happen, e.g. "git diff | cat" still paints
 its output in color by default.

 Stop leaking that environment variable to the pager's half of the
 fork; we only need it on "Git" side when we spawn the pager.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* mh/strbuf-read-file-returns-ssize-t (2015-07-03) 1 commit

[Stalled]

* sg/config-name-only (2015-05-28) 3 commits
 - completion: use new 'git config' options to reliably list variable names
 - SQUASH
 - config: add options to list only variable names

 "git config --list" output was hard to parse when values consist of
 multiple lines.  Introduce a way to show only the keys.

 Adding a single --name-only option may be a better way to go than
 adding two new options.

 Expecting a reroll.


* kk/log-merges-config (2015-04-21) 5 commits
 - bash-completion: add support for git-log --merges= and log.merges
 - t4202-log: add tests for --merges=
 - Documentation: add git-log --merges= option and log.merges config. var
 - log: honor log.merges= option
 - revision: add --merges={show|only|hide} option

 "git log" (but not other commands in the "log" family) learned to
 pay attention to the log.merges configuration variable that can be
 set to "show" (the normal behaviour), "only" (hide non-merge
 commits), or "hide" (hide merge commits).  --merges=(show|only|hide)
 can be used to override the setting from the command line.

 The documentation may need to be updated once more ($gmane/267250).
 Waiting for a reroll.


* mg/httpd-tests-update-for-apache-2.4 (2015-04-08) 2 commits
 - t/lib-git-svn: check same httpd module dirs as lib-httpd
 - t/lib-httpd: load mod_unixd

 This is the first two commits in a three-patch series $gmane/266962
 Will be rerolled.
 with updated log message ($gmane/268061).


* mh/numparse (2015-03-19) 14 commits
 - diff_opt_parse(): use convert_i() when handling --abbrev=<num>
 - diff_opt_parse(): use convert_i() when handling "-l<num>"
 - opt_arg(): simplify pointer handling
 - opt_arg(): report errors parsing option values
 - opt_arg(): use convert_i() in implementation
 - opt_arg(): val is always non-NULL
 - builtin_diff(): detect errors when parsing --unified argument
 - handle_revision_opt(): use convert_ui() when handling "--abbrev="
 - strtoul_ui(), strtol_i(): remove functions
 - handle_revision_opt(): use convert_i() when handling "-<digit>"
 - handle_revision_opt(): use skip_prefix() in many places
 - write_subdirectory(): use convert_ui() for parsing mode
 - cacheinfo_callback(): use convert_ui() when handling "--cacheinfo"
 - numparse: new module for parsing integral numbers

 Many codepaths use unchecked use of strtol() and friends (or even
 worse, atoi()).  Introduce a set of wrappers that try to be more
 careful.

 Expecting a reroll.
 ($gmane/268058).


* tf/gitweb-project-listing (2015-03-19) 5 commits
 - gitweb: make category headings into links when they are directories
 - gitweb: optionally set project category from its pathname
 - gitweb: add a link under the search box to clear a project filter
 - gitweb: if the PATH_INFO is incomplete, use it as a project_filter
 - gitweb: fix typo in man page

 Update gitweb to make it more pleasant to deal with a hierarchical
 forest of repositories.

 Any comments from those who use or have their own code in Gitweb?


* jc/a-lone-dash-stands-for-previous-branch (2015-03-16) 1 commit
 - "-" and "@{-1}" on various programs

 Lose special case code to make a lone dash "-" mean the previous
 branch aka "@{-1}" from a handful subcommands, and instead support
 the notation throughout the system by reimplementing it at the
 revisions layer.

 Needs tests, documentation updates, etc.  Also does only a half-way
 job dealing with range notation, which needs to be fixed before the
 series goes anywhere.


* nd/list-files (2015-02-09) 21 commits
 - t3080: tests for git-list-files
 - list-files: -M aka diff-cached
 - list-files -F: show submodules with the new indicator '&'

 - list-files: sort output and remove duplicates
 - list-files: add -t back
 - list-files: add -1 short for --no-column
 - list-files: add -R/--recursive short for --max-depth=-1
 - list-files: -u does not imply showing stages
 - list-files: make alias 'ls' default to 'list-files'
 - list-files: a user friendly version of ls-files and more
 - ls-files: support --max-depth
 - ls-files: add --column
 - ls-files: add --color to highlight file names
 - ls-files: buffer full item in strbuf before printing
 - ls_colors.c: highlight submodules like directories
 - ls_colors.c: add a function to color a file name
 - ls_colors.c: parse color.ls.* from config file
 - ls_colors.c: add $LS_COLORS parsing code

 A new "git list-files" Porcelain command, "ls-files" with bells and
 whistles.

 Reroll to base on wt-status work ($gmane/265142) has seen some
 positive discussions.

 Waiting for a further polished reroll ($gmane/265534).


* nd/pathspec-strip-fix (2015-04-18) 1 commit
 - pathspec: adjust prefixlen after striping trailing slash

 Does not quite fix ($gmane/267614).
 Will discard.


* jc/diff-b-m (2015-02-23) 5 commits
 . WIPWIP
 . WIP: diff-b-m
 - diffcore-rename: allow easier debugging
 - diffcore-rename.c: add locate_rename_src()
 - diffcore-break: allow debugging

 "git diff -B -M" produced incorrect patch when the postimage of a
 completely rewritten file is similar to the preimage of a removed
 file; such a resulting file must not be expressed as a rename from
 other place.

 The fix in this patch is broken, unfortunately.


* pw/remote-set-url-fetch (2014-11-26) 1 commit
 - remote: add --fetch and --both options to set-url

 Expecting a reroll.


* tr/remerge-diff (2014-11-10) 9 commits
 - t4213: avoid "|" in sed regexp
 - log --remerge-diff: show what the conflict resolution changed
 - name-hash: allow dir hashing even when !ignore_case
 - merge-recursive: allow storing conflict hunks in index
 - merge_diff_mode: fold all merge diff variants into an enum
 - combine-diff: do not pass revs->dense_combined_merges redundantly
 - merge-recursive: -Xindex-only to leave worktree unchanged
 - merge-recursive: internal flag to avoid touching the worktree
 - merge-recursive: remove dead conditional in update_stages()

 "log -p" output learns a new way to let users inspect a merge
 commit by showing the differences between the automerged result
 with conflicts the person who recorded the merge would have seen
 and the final conflict resolution that was recorded in the merge.

 Waiting for a reroll.
 ($gmane/256591).


* tg/perf-lib-test-perf-cleanup (2013-09-19) 2 commits
 - perf-lib: add test_perf_cleanup target
 - perf-lib: split starting the test from the execution

 Add test_perf_cleanup shell function to the perf suite, that allows
 the script writers to define a test with a clean-up action.

 Will hold.


* jc/show-branch (2014-03-24) 5 commits
 - show-branch: use commit slab to represent bitflags of arbitrary width
 - show-branch.c: remove "all_mask"
 - show-branch.c: abstract out "flags" operation

* jk/rev-list-no-bitmap-while-pruning (2015-07-01) 1 commit

 A minor bugfix when pack bitmap was brought in.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* kb/config-unmap-before-renaming (2015-06-30) 1 commit

 Will merge to 'next'.


* dt/refs-backend-preamble (2015-06-30) 8 commits
 - git-stash: use git-reflog instead of creating files
 - SQUASH???
 - git-reflog: add create and exists functions
 - refs: new public ref function: safe_create_reflog
 - refs: break out check for reflog autocreation
 - bisect: treat BISECT_HEAD as a ref
 - cherry-pick: treat CHERRY_PICK_HEAD and REVERT_HEAD as refs
 - refs.c: add err arguments to reflog functions

 In preparation for allowing different "backends" to store the refs
 in a way different from the traditional "one ref per file in $GIT_DIR
 or in a $GIT_DIR/packed-refs file" filesystem storage, reduce
 direct filesystem access to ref-like things like CHERRY_PICK_HEAD
 from scripts and programs.

 Will merge to 'next' after squashing the fix in.


* et/http-proxyauth (2015-06-29) 1 commit
 - http: always use any proxy auth method available

 We used to ask libCURL to use the most secure authentication method
 available when talking to an HTTP proxy only when we were told to
 talk to one via configuration variables.  We now ask libCURL to
 always use the most secure authentication method, because the user
 can tell libCURL to use an HTTP proxy via an environment variable
 without using configuration variables.

 Looked sensible.  An extra set of eyes appreciated, but I think
 this is ready.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jc/fsck-retire-require-eoh (2015-06-28) 1 commit
 - fsck: it is OK for a tag and a commit to lack the body

 A fix to a minor regression to "git fsck" in v2.2 era that started
 complaining about a body-less tag object when it lacks a separator
 empty line after its header to separate it with a non-existent body.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/date-mode-format (2015-06-29) 3 commits
 - introduce "format" date-mode
 - convert "enum date_mode" into a struct
 - show-branch: use DATE_RELATIVE instead of magic number

 Teach "git log" and friends a new "--date=format:..." option to
 format timestamps using system's strftime(3).

 Will merge to 'next'.

 Code clean-up.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* nd/export-worktree (2015-06-26) 1 commit
 - setup: set env $GIT_WORK_TREE when work tree is set, like $GIT_DIR

 Running an aliased command from a subdirectory when the .git thing
 in the working tree is a gitfile pointing elsewhere did not work.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sb/p5310-and-chain (2015-06-26) 1 commit
 - p5310: Fix broken && chain in performance test

 Code clean-up.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jc/rerere (2015-07-06) 19 commits

 - rerere: fix an off-by-one non-bug

 Code clean-up and minor fixes (so far).


* ad/bisect-terms (2015-06-29) 4 commits
 - bisect: allow setting any user-specified in 'git bisect start'
 - bisect: add 'git bisect terms' to view the current terms
 - bisect: add the terms old/new
 - bisect: sanity check on terms
 (this branch uses ad/bisect-cleanup.)

 The use of 'good/bad' in "git bisect" made it confusing to use when
 hunting for a state change that is not a regression (e.g. bugfix).
 The command learned 'old/new' and then allows the end user to
 say e.g. "bisect start --term-old=fast --term=new=slow" to find a
 performance regression.

 Michael's idea to make 'good/bad' more intelligent does have
 certain attractiveness ($gname/272867), and makes some of the work
 on this topic a moot point.


* mh/tempfile (2015-06-10) 14 commits

 - setup_temporary_shallow(): use tempfile module
 - write_shared_index(): use tempfile module
 - register_tempfile(): new function to handle an existing temporary file
 - tempfile: add several functions for creating temporary files
 - register_tempfile_object(): new function, extracted from create_tempfile()
 - commit_lock_file(): use get_locked_file_path()
 - lockfile: remove some redundant functions
 - tempfile: a new module for handling temporary files
 - Move lockfile API documentation to lockfile.h

 Rebuild "lockfile" API on top of a new "tempfile" API.
 This needs rerolling, to include "tempfile.h" in "lockfile.h", at
 least.

 Expecting a reroll.

 Abandoning an already applied change in "git rebase -i" with

* rh/test-color-avoid-terminfo-in-original-home (2015-06-17) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-06-24 at 6af5fa7)
 + test-lib.sh: fix color support when tput needs ~/.terminfo
 + Revert "test-lib.sh: do tests for color support after changing HOME"

 An ancient test framework enhancement to allow color was not
 entirely correct; this makes it work even when tput needs to read
 from the ~/.terminfo under the user's real HOME directory.

 "git verify-tag" and "git verify-commit" have been taught to share
 more code, and then learned to optionally show the verification
 message from the underlying GPG implementation.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* cb/parse-magnitude (2015-06-22) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-06-24 at 2fd7205)
 + parse-options: move unsigned long option parsing out of pack-objects.c
 + test-parse-options: update to handle negative ints

 Move machinery to parse human-readable scaled numbers like 1k, 4M,
 and 2G as an option parameter's value from pack-objects to
 parse-options API, to make it available to other codepaths.

 - cat-file: sort and de-dup output of --batch-all-objects
 - cat-file: add --batch-all-objects option
 - cat-file: split batch_one_object into two stages
 - cat-file: stop returning value from batch_one_object
 - cat-file: add --buffer option
 - cat-file: move batch_options definition to top of file
 - cat-file: minor style fix in options list
 - Merge branch 'jk/maint-for-each-packed-object' into jk/cat-file-batch-all
 (this branch uses jk/maint-for-each-packed-object.)

 "cat-file" learned "--batch-all-objects" option to enumerate all
 available objects in the repository more quickly than "rev-list
 --all --objects" (the output includes unreachable objects, though).

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/maint-for-each-packed-object (2015-06-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-06-24 at 162e134)
 + for_each_packed_object: automatically open pack index
 (this branch is used by jk/cat-file-batch-all.)

 The for_each_packed_object() API function did not iterate over
 objects in a packfile that hasn't been used yet.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/pkt-log-pack (2015-06-16) 3 commits
 - pkt-line: support tracing verbatim pack contents
 - pkt-line: tighten sideband PACK check when tracing
 - pkt-line: simplify starts_with checks in packet tracing

 Enhance packet tracing machinery to allow capturing an incoming
 pack data to a file for debugging.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* kn/for-each-ref (2015-06-15) 11 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-06-24 at 1a3a734)

 (this branch is used by kn/for-each-tag-branch.)

 GSoC project to rebuild ref listing by branch and tag based on the
 for-each-ref machinery.  This is its first part.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* mh/replace-refs (2015-06-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-06-24 at cb13adf)
 + Allow to control where the replace refs are looked for

 Add an environment variable to tell Git to look into refs hierarchy
 other than refs/replace/ for the object replacement data.


* nd/multiple-work-trees (2015-06-29) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-06-29 at fd4eb60)
 + worktree: new place for "git prune --worktrees"
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-06-24 at 7c3f918)
 + checkout: don't check worktrees when not necessary
 (this branch is used by es/worktree-add.)

 "git checkout [<tree-ish>] <paths>" spent unnecessary cycles
 checking if the current branch was checked out elsewhere, when we
 know we are not switching the branches ourselves.


* gp/status-rebase-i-info (2015-07-06) 4 commits
 - status: add new tests for status during rebase -i
 - status: give more information during rebase -i
 - status: differentiate interactive from non-interactive rebases
 - status: factor two rebase-related messages together

 Teach "git status" to show a more detailed information regarding
 the "rebase -i" session in progress.

 Looks ready for 'next'.  I however wonder if there is a negative
 interaction with 16cf51c7 (git-rebase--interactive.sh: add config
 option for custom instruction format, 2015-06-13)?


* mk/utf8-no-iconv-warn (2015-06-08) 1 commit
 - utf8.c: print warning about disabled iconv

 Warn when a reencoding is requested in a build without iconv
 support, as the end user is likely to get an unexpected result.  I
 think the same level of safety should be added to a build with
 iconv support when the specified encoding is not available, but the
 patch does not go there.

 Expecting a reroll.


* mr/rebase-i-customize-insn-sheet (2015-06-15) 1 commit
 - git-rebase--interactive.sh: add config option for custom instruction format

 "git rebase -i"'s list of todo is made configurable.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* pt/am-foreign (2015-06-15) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-06-24 at 838c702)
 + am: teach mercurial patch parser how to read from stdin
 + am: use gmtime() to parse mercurial patch date
 + t4150: test applying StGit series
 + am: teach StGit patch parser how to read from stdin
 + t4150: test applying StGit patch

 Various enhancements around "git am" reading patches generated by
 foreign SCM.


* pt/pull-builtin (2015-06-18) 19 commits

 - pull: teach git pull about --rebase
 - pull: set reflog message
 - pull: implement pulling into an unborn branch
 - pull: fast-forward working tree if head is updated
 - pull: check if in unresolved merge state

 - parse-options-cb: implement parse_opt_passthru()
 (this branch is used by pt/am-builtin.)

 Reimplement 'git pull' in C.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* rl/send-email-aliases (2015-07-07) 10 commits
 - send-email: suppress meaningless whitespaces in from field
 - send-email: allow multiple emails using --cc, --to and --bcc
 - send-email: consider quote as delimiter instead of character
 - send-email: reduce dependencies impact on parse_address_line
 - send-email: minor code refactoring
 - send-email: allow use of aliases in the From field of --compose mode
 - send-email: refactor address list process
 - t9001-send-email: refactor header variable fields replacement
 - send-email: allow aliases in patch header and command script outputs
 - t9001-send-email: move script creation in a setup test

 "git send-email" now performs alias-expansion on names that are
 given via --cccmd, etc.

 This round comes with a lot more enhanced e-mail address parser,
 which makes it a bit scary, but as long as it works as designed, it
 makes it wonderful ;-).

 Will merge to 'next'.


* wp/sha1-name-negative-match (2015-06-08) 2 commits
 - sha1_name.c: introduce '^{/!-<negative pattern>}' notation
 - test for '!' handling in rev-parse's named commits

 Introduce "branch^{/!-<pattern>}" notation to name a commit
 reachable from branch that does not match the given pattern.

 Expecting a reroll.


* bc/object-id (2015-06-17) 10 commits
 . remote.c: use struct object_id in many functions
 . object-id: use struct object_id in struct object
 . remote.c: use struct object_id in ref_newer()
 . transport-helper.c: use struct object_id in push_refs_with_export()
 . connect.c: use struct object_id in get_remote_heads()
 . remote-curl: use struct object_id in parse_fetch()
 . fetch-pack: use struct object_id in add_sought_entry_mem()
 . object_id: convert struct ref to use object_id.
 . sha1_file: introduce has_object_file() helper
 . refs: convert some internal functions to use object_id

 More transition from "unsigned char[40]" to "struct object_id".

 While GSoC and other topics are actively moving existing code
 around, this cannot go in; ejected from 'pu'.


* jk/log-missing-default-HEAD (2015-06-03) 1 commit
 - log: diagnose empty HEAD more clearly

 "git init empty && git -C empty log" said "bad default revision 'HEAD'",
 which was found to be a bit confusing to new users.

 What's the status of this one?


* gr/rebase-i-drop-warn (2015-06-30) 3 commits
 - git rebase -i: add static check for commands and SHA-1
 - git rebase -i: warn about removed commits
 - git-rebase -i: add command "drop" to remove a commit

 Add "drop commit-object-name subject" command as another way to
 skip replaying of a commit in "rebase -i", and then punish those
 who do not use it (and instead just remove the lines) by throwing
 a warning.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jh/strbuf-read-use-read-in-full (2015-06-01) 1 commit
 - strbuf_read(): skip unnecessary strbuf_grow() at eof

 Avoid one extra iteration and strbuf_grow() of 8kB in
 strbuf_read().

 Looked reasonable; perhaps a log message clarification is needed.

 Expecting a reroll.


* mg/index-read-error-messages (2015-06-01) 2 commits
 - messages: uniform error messages for index write
 - show-index: uniform error messages for index read

 The tip was RFC.
 Expecting a reroll.


* hv/submodule-config (2015-06-15) 4 commits
 - do not die on error of parsing fetchrecursesubmodules option
 - use new config API for worktree configurations of submodules
 - extract functions for submodule config set and lookup
 - implement submodule config API for lookup of .gitmodules values

 The gitmodules API accessed from the C code learned to cache stuff
 lazily.

 Looked reasonable from a cursory read.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jc/push-tags-also (2015-05-29) 1 commit
 - push --tags: push tags *in addition to* other stuff

 "git fetch --tags" learned to fetch tags in addition to other stuff
 a few years ago, but "git push --tags" didn't.  Now it does.

 A change to push out more than before always invites "what if the
 user makes a mistake" worries.

 Will discard.


* jc/commit-slab (2015-05-22) 1 commit
 - commit-slab: introduce slabname##_peek() function

 Memory use reduction when commit-slab facility is used to annotate
 sparsely (which is not recommended in the first place).

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jc/clone-bundle (2015-04-30) 1 commit
 - repack: optionally create a clone.bundle

 Waiting for further work.
 Still an early WIP.


* ee/clean-remove-dirs (2015-06-26) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-06-29 at d595659)
 + read_gitfile_gently: fix use-after-free
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-06-24 at 7c27821)
 + clean: improve performance when removing lots of directories
 + p7300: add performance tests for clean
 + t7300: add tests to document behavior of clean and nested git
 + setup: sanity check file size in read_gitfile_gently
 + setup: add gentle version of read_gitfile

 Replace "is this subdirectory a separate repository that should not
 be touched?" check "git clean" does by checking if it has .git/HEAD
 using the submodule-related code with a more optimized check.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/merge-drop-old-syntax (2015-04-29) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-05-28 at 6bfd8b9)
 + merge: drop 'git merge <message> HEAD <commit>' syntax

 Stop supporting "git merge <message> HEAD <commit>" syntax that
 has been deprecated since October 2007.

 Will keep in 'next' during the 2.5 cycle.
