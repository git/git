What's cooking in git.git (Aug 2010, #06; Thu, 26)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones
marked with '.' do not appear in any of the integration branches, but I am
still holding onto them.

--------------------------------------------------

value of the configuration and the command line option to false.

This probably needs tests; also we know of longstanding bugs in related
area that needs to be addressed---they do not have to be part of this
series but their reproduction recipe would belong to the test script for
this topic.
