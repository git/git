What's cooking in git.git (Oct 2024, #12; Wed, 30)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and
aren't considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL
to a message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity (of course they can be resubmit when new interests
arise).

This is the fifth integration round from the interim maintainer. A
large number of topics are currently sitting in 'next' and will likely
graduate to 'master' before the end of the week.

Regrettably, there continue to be lots of topics that are stuck
waiting for more discussion and would benefit from review. Please have
a look at any topics that you feel comfortable reviewing and please do
so if you find the time.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	https://github.com/git/git/

(Note that other usual spots are not updated while Junio is on
vacation, including the below):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-scm/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/ttaylorr/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

* jk/dumb-http-finalize (2024-10-25) 11 commits
 (merged to 'next' on 2024-10-30 at 00932eb724)
 + packfile: use oidread() instead of hashcpy() to fill object_id

 (this branch is used by kn/the-repository.)

 The dumb-http code regressed when the result of re-indexing a pack
 yielded an *.idx file that differs in content from the *.idx file it
 downloaded from the remote. This has been corrected by no longer
 relying on the *.idx file we got from the remote.

 Treat ECONNABORTED the same as ECONNRESET in 'git credential-cache' to

* hy/partial-repack-fix (2024-10-16) 3 commits
 . partial-clone: update doc
 . t0410: adapt tests to repack changes
 . repack: pack everything into packfile

 "git repack" avoids losing local objects that are reachable from
 objects in a packfile fetched from a promisor remote.

 Need review.

* ej/cat-file-remote-object-info (2024-10-29) 6 commits
 - cat-file: add remote-object-info to batch-command
 - cat-file: add declaration of variable i inside its for loop
 - transport: add client support for object-info
 - serve: advertise object-info feature
 - fetch-pack: move fetch initialization
 - fetch-pack: refactor packet writing

 "git cat-file --batch" and friends can optionally ask a remote
 server about objects it does not have.

 Needs review.

* cw/fix-reachable-in-repo-with-promisor (2024-09-19) 2 commits
 . fetch-pack.c: do not declare local commits as "have" in partial repos
 . packfile: split promisor objects oidset into two

 "git gc" in a partial clone (i.e. lacking objects that can be
 lazily fetched from promisor remotes) collected more than objects
 that promisor-remote can give.

 Appears to break CI.

 Describe the policy to introduce breaking changes.

 Will merge to 'master'.

* jc/strbuf-commented-something (2024-09-12) 2 commits
 - strbuf: retire strbuf_commented_lines()
 - strbuf: retire strbuf_commented_addf()

 Update two functions whose callers always pass the same global
 variable to omit the redundant parameter and use the global in the
 callee themselves.

 On hold.

* cc/promisor-remote-capability (2024-09-10) 4 commits
 - promisor-remote: check advertised name or URL
 - Add 'promisor-remote' capability to protocol v2
 - strbuf: refactor strbuf_trim_trailing_ch()
 - version: refactor strbuf_sanitize()

 The v2 protocol learned to allow the server to advertise possible
 promisor remotes, and the client to respond with what promissor
 remotes it uses, so that the server side can omit objects that the
 client can lazily obtain from these other promissor remotes.

 Comments?  I got an impression that this is premature without
 finishing the discussion on a larger picture.

* sj/ref-contents-check (2024-10-21) 9 commits
 - ref: add symlink ref content check for files backend
 - ref: check whether the target of the symref is a ref
 - ref: add basic symref content check for files backend
 - ref: add more strict checks for regular refs
 - ref: port git-fsck(1) regular refs check for files backend
 - ref: support multiple worktrees check for refs
 - ref: initialize target name outside of check functions
 - ref: check the full refname instead of basename
 - ref: initialize "fsck_ref_report" with zero

 "git fsck" learned to issue warnings on "curiously formatted" ref
 contents that have always been taken valid but something Git
 wouldn't have written itself (e.g., missing terminating end-of-line
 after the full object name).

 Needs review.
