What's cooking in git.git (Mar 2009, #02; Thu, 05)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones
marked with '.' do not appear in any of the branches, but I am still
holding onto them.

The topics list the commits in reverse chronological order.  The topics
meant to be merged to the maintenance series have "maint-" in their names.

The master branch is slightly past 1.6.2, but embarrasingly enough we
already have a real commit on 'maint'.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* hv/cvsimport-tests (Mon Mar 2 18:59:36 2009 +0100) 1 commit
 - cvsimport: add test illustrating a bug in cvsps

Yet more tests without fixing anything...

* jc/clone-branch-rebase (Tue Mar 3 22:29:55 2009 -0800) 1 commit
 - Make git-clone respect branch.autosetuprebase

This is rewrite of a patch from Pat Notz.

* mg/maint-submodule-normalize-path (Tue Mar 3 16:08:21 2009 +0100) 2 commits
 - git submodule: Fix adding of submodules at paths with ./, .. and //
 - git submodule: Add test cases for git submodule add

* kb/tracking-count-no-merges (Wed Mar 4 18:47:39 2009 +0100) 1 commit
 - stat_tracking_info(): only count real commits

This gives the merge commits zero weight when talking about how many
commits you have ahead (or behind) of the branch you are tracking.  Even
though I agree that they should carry much less weight than the "real"
commits, because your repeated merge from the other branch does not really
add any real value to the end result, giving them absolute zero weight
somehow feels wrong. At least it shows that your have been _active_ on the
branch.  But I do not feel very strongly about it.

* js/rebase-i-opt (Tue Mar 3 10:55:31 2009 +0100) 1 commit
 - rebase -i: avoid 'git reset' when possible

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Will merge to 'master' soon]

* jk/sane-relative-time (Tue Feb 24 00:42:16 2009 -0500) 1 commit
 + never fallback relative times to absolute

I think I sent out a "here is how" patch for something related to
--date=<format> option that may be related to this topic; I seem to have
lost it.

* js/send-email (Mon Mar 2 23:52:18 2009 -0500) 5 commits
 + send-email: add --confirm option and configuration setting
 + send-email: don't create temporary compose file until it is needed
 + send-email: --suppress-cc improvements
 + send-email: handle multiple Cc addresses when reading mbox message
 + send-email: allow send-email to run outside a repo

* sg/rerere-cleanup (Sat Feb 14 23:21:04 2009 +0100) 1 commit
 + rerere: remove duplicated functions

* jc/add-p-unquote (Mon Feb 16 22:43:43 2009 -0800) 1 commit
 + git-add -i/-p: learn to unwrap C-quoted paths

* jw/imap-preformatted-html (Thu Feb 12 08:58:12 2009 -0600) 1 commit
 + imap.preformattedHTML to tell Thunderbird to send non-flowed text

The patch text should be identical to Jeremy's "Virtual Patch", except
that the configuration variable was renamed per list discussion.

* jw/format-patch-attach (Thu Feb 12 09:51:55 2009 -0600) 1 commit
 + Enable setting attach as the default in .gitconfig for git-format-
   patch.

* sr/force-rebase (Fri Feb 13 23:48:01 2009 +0100) 1 commit
 + Teach rebase to rebase even if upstream is up to date

* fg/exclude-bq (Tue Feb 10 15:20:17 2009 +0100) 1 commit
 + Support "\" in non-wildcard exclusion entries

* dm/add-i-edit-abort (Thu Feb 12 00:19:41 2009 -0500) 1 commit
 + add -i: revisit hunk on editor failure

* tp/completion (Sat Feb 21 15:48:43 2009 +0100) 6 commits
 + Fixup: Add bare repository indicator for __git_ps1
 + Add bare repository indicator for __git_ps1
 + completion: More fixes to prevent unbound variable errors
 + completion: Better __git_ps1 support when not in working directory
 + completion: Use consistent if [...] convention, not "test"
 + completion: For consistency, change "git rev-parse" to __gitdir
   calls

* js/branch-symref (Wed Feb 18 22:34:44 2009 -0500) 4 commits
 + add basic branch display tests
 + branch: clean up repeated strlen
 + Avoid segfault with 'git branch' when the HEAD is detached
 + builtin-branch: improve output when displaying remote branches

* al/ansi-color (Fri Feb 13 22:53:41 2009 +0100) 2 commits
 + builtin-branch.c: Rename branch category color names
 + Clean up use of ANSI color sequences

* js/valgrind (Thu Feb 5 22:03:00 2009 +0100) 9 commits
 + valgrind: do not require valgrind 3.4.0 or newer
 + test-lib: avoid assuming that templates/ are in the GIT_EXEC_PATH
 + Tests: let --valgrind imply --verbose and --tee
 + Add a script to coalesce the valgrind outputs
 + t/Makefile: provide a 'valgrind' target
 + test-lib.sh: optionally output to test-results/$TEST.out, too
 + Valgrind support: check for more than just programming errors
 + valgrind: ignore ldso and more libz errors
 + Add valgrind support in test scripts

 + git config: trivial cleanup for editor action
 + git config: codestyle cleanups
 + config: Add new option to open an editor.

Rerolled and looked sane.

* jc/blame (Wed Jun 4 22:58:40 2008 -0700) 2 commits
 + blame: show "previous" information in --porcelain/--incremental
   format
 + git-blame: refactor code to emit "porcelain format" output

This gives Porcelains (like gitweb) the information on the commit _before_
the one that the final blame is laid on, which should save them one
rev-parse to dig further.  Jakub seems to want this for gitweb.

* ns/pretty-format (Tue Feb 24 15:33:29 2009 +0200) 5 commits
 + bash completion: add --format= and --oneline options for "git log"
 + Add tests for git log --pretty, --format and --oneline.
 + Add --oneline that is a synonym to "--pretty=oneline --abbrev-
   commit"
 + Give short-hands to --pretty=tformat:%formatstring
 + Add --format that is a synonym to --pretty

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Discarded]

* js/clone-depth-local (Fri Feb 27 00:04:06 2009 -0800) 3 commits
 . parse_options(): do not "increment" boolean
 . clone: ignore --depth when cloning locally (implicitly --local)
 . clone: do not ignore --no-local option

Jeff had a good suggestion for this series but it was tripped by
a misfeature in parse_options().

* ns/stash-keep (Thu Feb 12 06:25:14 2009 +0900) 1 commit
 . stash: --keep option just saves

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Stalled and may need help and prodding to go forward]

* lh/submodule-tree-traversal (Sun Jan 25 01:52:06 2009 +0100) 1 commit
 - archive.c: add support for --submodules[=(all|checkedout)]

Discussion stalled on the submodule selection criteria.

* jc/merge-convert (Mon Jan 26 16:45:01 2009 -0800) 1 commit
 - git-merge-file: allow converting the results for the work tree

This is a feature waiting for a user.

We did not give scripted Porcelains a way to say "this temporary file I am
using for merging is for this path, so use the core.autocrlf and attributes
rules for that final path".  Instead, merge-file simply wrote out the
data in the canonical repository representation.

rerere has the same issue, but it is a lot worse.  It reads the three
files (preimage, postimage and thisimage) from the work tree in the work
tree representation, merges them without converting them to the canonical
representation first but inserts the conflict markers with the canonical
representation and writes the resulting mess out.  It needs to be fixed to
read with convert_to_git(), merge them while they are still in the
canonical representation and possibly add conflict markers, and then write
the results out after convert_to_working_tree().  It also needs to write
in binary mode as well.

* db/foreign-scm (Sun Jan 11 15:12:10 2009 -0500) 3 commits
 - Support fetching from foreign VCSes
 - Add specification of git-vcs helpers
 - Add "vcs" config option in remotes

The "spec" did not seem quite well cooked yet, but in the longer term I
think something like this to allow interoperating with other SCMs as if
the other end is a native git repository is a very worthy goal.

* cc/replace (Mon Feb 2 06:13:06 2009 +0100) 11 commits
 - builtin-replace: use "usage_msg_opt" to give better error messages
 - parse-options: add new function "usage_msg_opt"
 - builtin-replace: teach "git replace" to actually replace
 - Add new "git replace" command
 - environment: add global variable to disable replacement
 - mktag: call "check_sha1_signature" with the replacement sha1
 - replace_object: add a test case
 - object: call "check_sha1_signature" with the replacement sha1
 - sha1_file: add a "read_sha1_file_repl" function
 - replace_object: add mechanism to replace objects found in
   "refs/replace/"
 - refs: add a "for_each_replace_ref" function

I think the code is much cleaner than the first round, but I am not
convinced it is doing the right thing in the connectivity traverser.
Independent review sorely needed.

* sc/gitweb-category (Fri Dec 12 00:45:12 2008 +0100) 3 commits
 - gitweb: Optional grouping of projects by category
 - gitweb: Split git_project_list_body in two functions
 - gitweb: Modularized git_get_project_description to be more generic

Design discussion between Jakub and Sebastien seems to have stalled, but
Jakub seems to be taking this over, so I'll probably discard these three
shortly.

----------------------------------------------------------------

As always with patches from René, this is already next material.

 - Push to create

This was a failed weatherbaloon patch to allow creation of a new
repository from the remote side.  Will discard.

* el/blame-date (Fri Feb 20 14:51:11 2009 -0800) 1 commit
 - Make git blame's date output format configurable, like git log

I think the above seven series were basically Ok; I'll hopefully have time
to re-read them and merge them to 'next'.

 - Test contents of entire cvsimported "master" tree contents
 - Use CVS's -f option if available (ignore user's ~/.cvsrc file)

   push

These are for 1.7.0, but the messages when they trigger together may need
to be rethought.

* jc/commit-assume-also-during-merge (Thu Jan 22 22:21:49 2009 -0800) 3 commits
 - git commit: pathspec without -i/-o implies -i semantics during a
   merge
 - builtin-commit: shorten eye-sore overlong lines
 - Add "partial commit" tests during a conflicted merge

This was only meant as a weatherballoon to help facilitate discussion.
Will be discarded.
