What's cooking in git.git (May 2020, #07; Wed, 20)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

Git 2.27-rc1 has been tagged.  There are a handful of topics to
further fix-up what we have been built during this cycle still not
in 'next', and they will be merged to 'next' later today and then
down to 'master' before -rc2.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* ak/slab-decl-cleanup (2020-05-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-05-19 at 7de41005de)
 + commit-slab-decl.h: update include guard

 Code clean-up.


* cb/no-more-gmtime (2020-05-14) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-05-15 at 160e0ada09)
 + compat: remove gmtime

 Code clean-up by removing a compatibility implementation of a
 function we no longer use.


* dd/t1509-i18n-fix (2020-05-13) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-05-15 at a6342455c1)
 + t1509: correct i18n test

 A few tests were not i18n clean.


* ds/trace-log-progress-fix (2020-05-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-05-15 at d82c1fd03f)
 + progress: call trace2_region_leave() only after calling _enter()

 Last-minute fix for our recent change to allow use of progress API
 as a traceable region.


* en/merge-rename-rename-worktree-fix (2020-05-14) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-05-15 at 7e1ddfa3c9)
 + merge-recursive: fix rename/rename(1to2) for working tree with a binary

 When a binary file gets modified and renamed on both sides of history
 to different locations, both files would be written to the working
 tree but both would have the contents from "ours".  This has been
 corrected so that the path from each side gets their original content.


* en/sparse-checkout (2020-05-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-05-15 at d4b3058787)
 + unpack-trees: also allow get_progress() to work on a different index

 Consistency fix to a topic already in 'master'.


* es/bugreport (2020-05-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-05-19 at ede8c892b8)
 + git-bugreport.txt: adjust reference to strftime(3)

 Doc fix.


* jc/fix-tap-output-under-bash (2020-05-15) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-05-15 at de8f92d652)
 + Revert "tests: when run in Bash, annotate test failures with file name/line number"
 + Revert "ci: add a problem matcher for GitHub Actions"
 + Revert "t/test_lib: avoid naked bash arrays in file_lineno"

 A recent attempt to make the test output nicer to view on CI
 systems broke TAP output under bash.  The effort has been reverted
 to be re-attempted in the next cycle.


* js/ci-sdk-download-fix (2020-05-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-05-15 at 9b28f7ec87)
 + ci: avoid pounding on the poor ci-artifacts container

 Instead of downloading Windows SDK for CI jobs for windows builds
 from an external site (wingit.blob.core.windows.net), use the one
 created in the windows-build job, to work around quota issues at
 the external site.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

 Test fix.

 Will merge to 'next' and then to 'master'.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* dr/push-remoteref-fix (2020-04-23) 1 commit
 - remote.c: fix handling of %(push:remoteref)

 The "%(push:remoteref)" placeholder in the "--format=" argument of
 "git format-patch" (and friends) only showed what got explicitly
 configured, not what ref at the receiving end would be updated when
 "git push" was used, as it ignored the default behaviour (e.g. update
 the same ref as the source).

 Expecting a reroll.
 cf. <20200416152145.wp2zeibxmuyas6y6@feanor>


* pw/rebase-i-more-options (2020-04-29) 5 commits

 - rebase -i: support --ignore-date
 - sequencer: rename amend_author to author_to_free
 - rebase -i: support --committer-date-is-author-date

 "git rebase -i" learns a bit more options.

 Expecting a reroll.
 cf. <c3dad0e2-e381-499a-af02-ef3f49207c49@gmail.com>

 - completion: add tests showing lack of support for git switch -c/-C
 - completion: add test highlighting subpar git switch --track completion
 - completion: add test showing subpar git switch completion
 - completion: add some simple test cases for git switch completion

 The command line completion (in contrib/) learned to complete
 options that the "git switch" command takes.

 Needs review.


* dl/test-must-fail-fixes-5 (2020-05-05) 4 commits
 - lib-submodule-update: pass OVERWRITING_FAIL
 - lib-submodule-update: prepend "git" to $command
 - lib-submodule-update: consolidate --recurse-submodules
 - lib-submodule-update: add space after function name

 The effort to avoid using test_must_fail on non-git command continues.

 Needs review.
 cf. <cover.1588162842.git.liu.denton@gmail.com>

 Rewrite of the remainder of "git bisect" script in C continues.

 Needs review.

 - zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

 - remote-curl: error on incomplete packet
 - pkt-line: extern packet_length()
 - transport: extract common fetch_pack() call
 - remote-curl: remove label indentation
 - remote-curl: fix typo

 On-the-wire protocol v2 easily falls into a deadlock between the
 remote-curl helper and the fetch-pack process when the server side
 prematurely throws an error and disconnects.  The communication has
 been updated to make it more robust.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* gp/hppa-stack-test-fix (2020-05-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-05-20 at 57ed63b4ad)

 one changeset, but kept going (by mistake?)

 Will merge to 'next'.

 atomicity.

 Needs review.

 . ci: respect the [skip ci] convention in our GitHub workflow "CI/PR"

 Allow contributors to mark a branch/push that it does not have to
 be built via GitHub actions, in a way similar to how Travis lets
 them mark the commits with an embedded "[skip ci]" string.

 Superseded by dd/ci-only-on-selective-branches topic.


* dd/ci-only-on-selective-branches (2020-05-05) 2 commits
