What's cooking in git.git (Jul 2015, #06; Tue, 21)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.

Tagged v2.5-rc3 today; hopefully we can have an uneventful 2.5 next
week and then start the next cycle.  I'll eject/drop the stalled
topics and ask people to reroll/rebase if their topics are still
viable.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* jc/clone-bundle (2015-04-30) 1 commit
 - repack: optionally create a clone.bundle

 Waiting for further work.
 Still an early WIP.


* jh/strbuf-read-use-read-in-full (2015-06-01) 1 commit
 - strbuf_read(): skip unnecessary strbuf_grow() at eof

 Avoid one extra iteration and strbuf_grow() of 8kB in
 strbuf_read().

 Looked reasonable; perhaps a log message clarification is needed.

 Expecting a reroll.


* mg/index-read-error-messages (2015-06-01) 2 commits
 - messages: uniform error messages for index write
 - show-index: uniform error messages for index read

 The tip was RFC.
 Expecting a reroll.


* hv/submodule-config (2015-06-15) 4 commits
 - do not die on error of parsing fetchrecursesubmodules option
 - use new config API for worktree configurations of submodules
 - extract functions for submodule config set and lookup
 - implement submodule config API for lookup of .gitmodules values

 The gitmodules API accessed from the C code learned to cache stuff
 lazily.

 Needs another reroll? ($gmane/273743).


* jk/log-missing-default-HEAD (2015-06-03) 1 commit
 - log: diagnose empty HEAD more clearly

 "git init empty && git -C empty log" said "bad default revision 'HEAD'",
 which was found to be a bit confusing to new users.

 What's the status of this one?


* bc/object-id (2015-06-17) 10 commits
 . remote.c: use struct object_id in many functions
 . object-id: use struct object_id in struct object
 . remote.c: use struct object_id in ref_newer()
 . transport-helper.c: use struct object_id in push_refs_with_export()
 . connect.c: use struct object_id in get_remote_heads()
 . remote-curl: use struct object_id in parse_fetch()
 . fetch-pack: use struct object_id in add_sought_entry_mem()
 . object_id: convert struct ref to use object_id.
 . sha1_file: introduce has_object_file() helper
 . refs: convert some internal functions to use object_id

 More transition from "unsigned char[40]" to "struct object_id".

 While GSoC and other topics are actively moving existing code
 around, this cannot go in; ejected from 'pu'.


* wp/sha1-name-negative-match (2015-06-08) 2 commits
 - sha1_name.c: introduce '^{/!-<negative pattern>}' notation
 - test for '!' handling in rev-parse's named commits

 Introduce "branch^{/!-<pattern>}" notation to name a commit
 reachable from branch that does not match the given pattern.

 Expecting a reroll.


* mk/utf8-no-iconv-warn (2015-06-08) 1 commit
 - utf8.c: print warning about disabled iconv

 Warn when a reencoding is requested in a build without iconv
 support, as the end user is likely to get an unexpected result.  I
 think the same level of safety should be added to a build with
 iconv support when the specified encoding is not available, but the
 patch does not go there.

 Expecting a reroll.


* ak/format-patch-odir-config (2015-06-19) 1 commit
 - format-patch: introduce format.outputDirectory configuration

 Reroll exists but didn't pick it up as it seemed to be still
 collecting review comments.

 Expecting a reroll.
 ($gmane/272180).


* mh/tempfile (2015-06-10) 14 commits
 - credential-cache--daemon: use tempfile module
 - credential-cache--daemon: delete socket from main()
 - gc: use tempfile module to handle gc.pid file
 - lock_repo_for_gc(): compute the path to "gc.pid" only once
 - diff: use tempfile module
 - setup_temporary_shallow(): use tempfile module
 - write_shared_index(): use tempfile module
 - register_tempfile(): new function to handle an existing temporary file
 - tempfile: add several functions for creating temporary files
 - register_tempfile_object(): new function, extracted from create_tempfile()
 - commit_lock_file(): use get_locked_file_path()
 - lockfile: remove some redundant functions
 - tempfile: a new module for handling temporary files
 - Move lockfile API documentation to lockfile.h

 Rebuild "lockfile" API on top of a new "tempfile" API.
 This needs rerolling, to include "tempfile.h" in "lockfile.h", at
 least.

 Expecting a reroll.
 ($gmane/271353)


* ad/bisect-terms (2015-06-29) 4 commits
 - bisect: allow setting any user-specified in 'git bisect start'
 - bisect: add 'git bisect terms' to view the current terms
 - bisect: add the terms old/new
 - bisect: sanity check on terms
 (this branch uses ad/bisect-cleanup.)

 The use of 'good/bad' in "git bisect" made it confusing to use when
 hunting for a state change that is not a regression (e.g. bugfix).
 The command learned 'old/new' and then allows the end user to
 say e.g. "bisect start --term-old=fast --term=new=slow" to find a
 performance regression.

 Michael's idea to make 'good/bad' more intelligent does have
 certain attractiveness ($gname/272867), and makes some of the work
 on this topic a moot point.

 Will hold.


* mh/notes-allow-reading-treeish (2015-07-13) 1 commit
 - notes: allow treeish expressions as notes ref

 Some "git notes" operations, e.g. "git log --notes=<note>", should
 be able to read notes from any tree-ish that is shaped like a notes
 tree, but the notes infrastructure required that the argument must
 be a ref under refs/notes/.  Loosen it to require a valid ref only
 when the operation would update the notes (in which case we must
 have a place to store the updated notes tree, iow, a ref).

 Needs update to docs.


* sg/config-name-only (2015-05-28) 3 commits
 - completion: use new 'git config' options to reliably list variable names
 - SQUASH
 - config: add options to list only variable names

 "git config --list" output was hard to parse when values consist of
 multiple lines.  Introduce a way to show only the keys.

 Adding a single --name-only option may be a better way to go than
 adding two new options.

 Expecting a reroll.


* kk/log-merges-config (2015-04-21) 5 commits
 - bash-completion: add support for git-log --merges= and log.merges
 - t4202-log: add tests for --merges=
 - Documentation: add git-log --merges= option and log.merges config. var
 - log: honor log.merges= option
 - revision: add --merges={show|only|hide} option

 "git log" (but not other commands in the "log" family) learned to
 pay attention to the log.merges configuration variable that can be
 set to "show" (the normal behaviour), "only" (hide non-merge
 commits), or "hide" (hide merge commits).  --merges=(show|only|hide)
 can be used to override the setting from the command line.

 The documentation may need to be updated once more ($gmane/267250).
 Waiting for a reroll.


* mg/httpd-tests-update-for-apache-2.4 (2015-04-08) 2 commits
 - t/lib-git-svn: check same httpd module dirs as lib-httpd
 - t/lib-httpd: load mod_unixd

 This is the first two commits in a three-patch series $gmane/266962
 Will be rerolled.
 with updated log message ($gmane/268061).


* mh/numparse (2015-03-19) 14 commits
 - diff_opt_parse(): use convert_i() when handling --abbrev=<num>
 - diff_opt_parse(): use convert_i() when handling "-l<num>"
 - opt_arg(): simplify pointer handling
 - opt_arg(): report errors parsing option values
 - opt_arg(): use convert_i() in implementation
 - opt_arg(): val is always non-NULL
 - builtin_diff(): detect errors when parsing --unified argument
 - handle_revision_opt(): use convert_ui() when handling "--abbrev="
 - strtoul_ui(), strtol_i(): remove functions
 - handle_revision_opt(): use convert_i() when handling "-<digit>"
 - handle_revision_opt(): use skip_prefix() in many places
 - write_subdirectory(): use convert_ui() for parsing mode
 - cacheinfo_callback(): use convert_ui() when handling "--cacheinfo"
 - numparse: new module for parsing integral numbers

 Many codepaths use unchecked use of strtol() and friends (or even
 worse, atoi()).  Introduce a set of wrappers that try to be more
 careful.

 Expecting a reroll.
 ($gmane/268058).


* jc/a-lone-dash-stands-for-previous-branch (2015-03-16) 1 commit
 - "-" and "@{-1}" on various programs

 Lose special case code to make a lone dash "-" mean the previous
 branch aka "@{-1}" from a handful subcommands, and instead support
 the notation throughout the system by reimplementing it at the
 revisions layer.

 Needs tests, documentation updates, etc.  Also does only a half-way
 job dealing with range notation, which needs to be fixed before the
 series goes anywhere.


* nd/list-files (2015-02-09) 21 commits
 - t3080: tests for git-list-files
 - list-files: -M aka diff-cached
 - list-files -F: show submodules with the new indicator '&'
 - list-files: add -F/--classify
 - list-files: show directories as well as files
 - list-files: do not show duplicate cached entries
 - list-files: sort output and remove duplicates
 - list-files: add -t back
 - list-files: add -1 short for --no-column
 - list-files: add -R/--recursive short for --max-depth=-1
 - list-files: -u does not imply showing stages
 - list-files: make alias 'ls' default to 'list-files'
 - list-files: a user friendly version of ls-files and more
 - ls-files: support --max-depth
 - ls-files: add --column
 - ls-files: add --color to highlight file names
 - ls-files: buffer full item in strbuf before printing
 - ls_colors.c: highlight submodules like directories
 - ls_colors.c: add a function to color a file name
 - ls_colors.c: parse color.ls.* from config file
 - ls_colors.c: add $LS_COLORS parsing code

 A new "git list-files" Porcelain command, "ls-files" with bells and
 whistles.

 Reroll to base on wt-status work ($gmane/265142) has seen some
 positive discussions.

 Waiting for a further polished reroll ($gmane/265534).


* nd/pathspec-strip-fix (2015-04-18) 1 commit
 - pathspec: adjust prefixlen after striping trailing slash

 Does not quite fix ($gmane/267614).
 Will discard.


* jc/diff-b-m (2015-02-23) 5 commits
 . WIPWIP
 . WIP: diff-b-m
 - diffcore-rename: allow easier debugging
 - diffcore-rename.c: add locate_rename_src()
 - diffcore-break: allow debugging

 "git diff -B -M" produced incorrect patch when the postimage of a
 completely rewritten file is similar to the preimage of a removed
 file; such a resulting file must not be expressed as a rename from
 other place.

 The fix in this patch is broken, unfortunately.


* pw/remote-set-url-fetch (2014-11-26) 1 commit
 - remote: add --fetch and --both options to set-url

 Expecting a reroll.


* tr/remerge-diff (2014-11-10) 9 commits
 - t4213: avoid "|" in sed regexp
 - log --remerge-diff: show what the conflict resolution changed
 - name-hash: allow dir hashing even when !ignore_case
 - merge-recursive: allow storing conflict hunks in index
 - merge_diff_mode: fold all merge diff variants into an enum
 - combine-diff: do not pass revs->dense_combined_merges redundantly
 - merge-recursive: -Xindex-only to leave worktree unchanged
 - merge-recursive: internal flag to avoid touching the worktree
 - merge-recursive: remove dead conditional in update_stages()

 "log -p" output learns a new way to let users inspect a merge
 commit by showing the differences between the automerged result
 with conflicts the person who recorded the merge would have seen
 and the final conflict resolution that was recorded in the merge.

 Waiting for a reroll.
 ($gmane/256591).


* tg/perf-lib-test-perf-cleanup (2013-09-19) 2 commits
 - perf-lib: add test_perf_cleanup target
 - perf-lib: split starting the test from the execution

 Add test_perf_cleanup shell function to the perf suite, that allows
 the script writers to define a test with a clean-up action.

 Will hold.


* jc/show-branch (2014-03-24) 5 commits
 - show-branch: use commit slab to represent bitflags of arbitrary width
 - show-branch.c: remove "all_mask"
 - show-branch.c: abstract out "flags" operation
 - show-branch.c: lift all_mask/all_revs to a global static
 - show-branch.c: update comment style

 Waiting for the final step to lift the hard-limit.

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* zb/userdiff-fountain (2015-07-21) 2 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - userdiff: add support for Fountain documents

 New userdiff pattern definition for fountain screenwriting markup
 format.

 Waiting for a response ($gmane/274403).


* as/sparse-checkout-removal (2015-07-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-07-21 at ab94680)
 + unpack-trees: don't update files with CE_WT_REMOVE set

 "sparse checkout" misbehaved for a path that is excluded from the
 checkout when switching between branches that differ at the path.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* cb/uname-in-untracked (2015-07-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-07-21 at d867af0)
 + untracked: fix detection of uname(2) failure

 An experimental "untracked cache" feature used uname(2) in a
 slightly unportable way.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* bw/portability-solaris (2015-07-20) 3 commits
 - tests: fix sed usage in tests to work around broken xpg4/sed on Solaris
 - tests: fix sed usage in tests to work around broken xpg4/sed on Solaris
 - tests: modify tr expressions so that xpg4/tr handles it on Solaris

 Needs another reroll? ($gmane/274296)


* es/worktree-add (2015-07-20) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-07-20 at 76e840b)

 + Documentation/git-worktree: wordsmith worktree-related manpages
 + Documentation/config: fix stale "git prune --worktree" reference

 + Documentation/git-worktree: consistently use term "linked working tree"
 (this branch is used by es/worktree-add-cleanup.)

 Will merge to 'master'.


* sg/bash-prompt-untracked-optim (2015-07-20) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-07-21 at e151fb7)
 + bash prompt: faster untracked status indicator with untracked directories
 + bash prompt: test untracked files status indicator with untracked dirs

 Will merge to 'master'.


* es/worktree-add-cleanup (2015-07-20) 22 commits

 - worktree: avoid resolving HEAD unnecessarily
 - worktree: make setup of new HEAD distinct from worktree population
 - worktree: detect branch-name/detached and error conditions locally
 - worktree: add_worktree: construct worktree-population command locally
 - worktree: elucidate environment variables intended for child processes
 - worktree: make branch creation distinct from worktree population
 - worktree: add: suppress auto-vivication with --detach and no <branch>
 - worktree: make --detach mutually exclusive with -b/-B
 - worktree: introduce options container

 Remove the "new-worktree-mode" hack in "checkout" that was added in
 nd/multiple-work-trees topic by updating the implementation of new
 "worktree add".

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ib/scripted-parse-opt-better-hint-string (2015-07-15) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-07-17 at 7bb1674)
 + rev-parse --parseopt: allow [*=?!] in argument hints

 The "rev-parse --parseopt" mode parsed the option specification
 and the argument hint in a strange way to allow '=' and other
 special characters in the option name while forbidding them from
 the argument hint.  This made it impossible to define an option
 like "--pair <key>=<value>" with "pair=key=value" specification,
 which instead would have defined a "--pair=key <value>" option.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* mh/fast-import-optimize-current-from (2015-07-13) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-07-15 at 2be8b1f)
 + fast-import: do less work when given "from" matches current branch head

 Often a fast-import stream builds a new commit on top of the
 previous commit it built, and it often unconditionally emits a
 "from" command to specify the first parent, which can be omitted in
 such a case.  This caused fast-import to forget the tree of the
 previous commit and then re-read it from scratch, which was
 inefficient.  Optimize for this common case.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* dt/log-follow-config (2015-07-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-07-10 at b8fbb43)
 + log: add "log.follow" configuration variable

 Add a new configuration variable to enable "--follow" automatically
 when "git log" is run with one pathspec argument.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* kn/tag-doc-fix (2015-07-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-07-15 at 7bd6038)
 + Documentation/tag: remove double occurance of "<pattern>"

 Will merge to 'master'.


* se/doc-checkout-ours-theirs (2015-07-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-07-21 at 5275f04)
 + checkout: document subtlety around --ours/--theirs

 A "rebase" replays changes of the local branch on top of something
 else, as such they are placed in stage #3 and referred to as
 "theirs", while the changes in the new base, typically a foreign
 work, are placed in stage #2 and referred to as "ours".  Clarify
 the "checkout --ours/--theirs".

 Will merge to 'master'.


* pt/am-tests (2015-07-20) 12 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-07-21 at 8d3d5f4)

 Will merge to 'master'.


* kn/for-each-tag-branch (2015-07-13) 11 commits

 + t6302: for-each-ref tests for ref-filter APIs
 (this branch uses kn/for-each-ref.)

 Port features over from tag -l and branch -l to for-each-ref
 so that eventually the unified implementation can be used to
 reimplement tag -l and branch -l, shared across all three, in
 a follow-up series or two.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 - git-reflog: add exists command
 - refs: new public ref function: safe_create_reflog

 - refs.c: add err arguments to reflog functions

 In preparation for allowing different "backends" to store the refs
 in a way different from the traditional "one ref per file in $GIT_DIR
 or in a $GIT_DIR/packed-refs file" filesystem storage, reduce
 direct filesystem access to ref-like things like CHERRY_PICK_HEAD
 from scripts and programs.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/date-mode-format (2015-07-20) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-07-21 at 69f66be)

 format timestamps using system's strftime(3).

 Will merge to 'master'.

  (merged to 'next' on 2015-07-09 at 1581a9b)
 + setup: set env $GIT_WORK_TREE when work tree is set, like $GIT_DIR

 Running an aliased command from a subdirectory when the .git thing
 in the working tree is a gitfile pointing elsewhere did not work.

 a warning.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/push-tags-also (2015-05-29) 1 commit
 - push --tags: push tags *in addition to* other stuff

 "git fetch --tags" learned to fetch tags in addition to other stuff
 a few years ago, but "git push --tags" didn't.  Now it does.

 A change to push out more than before always invites "what if the
 user makes a mistake" worries.

 Will discard.


* jc/commit-slab (2015-05-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-07-15 at 4c83475)
 + commit-slab: introduce slabname##_peek() function

 Memory use reduction when commit-slab facility is used to annotate
 sparsely (which is not recommended in the first place).

 Will merge to 'master'.

 + setup: sanity check file size in read_gitfile_gently
 + setup: add gentle version of read_gitfile

 Replace "is this subdirectory a separate repository that should not
 be touched?" check "git clean" does by checking if it has .git/HEAD
 using the submodule-related code with a more optimized check.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/merge-drop-old-syntax (2015-04-29) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2015-05-28 at 6bfd8b9)
 + merge: drop 'git merge <message> HEAD <commit>' syntax

 Stop supporting "git merge <message> HEAD <commit>" syntax that
 has been deprecated since October 2007.

 Will keep in 'next' during the 2.5 cycle.

 - gitweb: optionally set project category from its pathname
 - gitweb: add a link under the search box to clear a project filter
 - gitweb: if the PATH_INFO is incomplete, use it as a project_filter

 Update gitweb to make it more pleasant to deal with a hierarchical
 forest of repositories.

 A fresh restart will not be rejected, but ejected from my tree for
 now.
