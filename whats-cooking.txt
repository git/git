What's cooking in git.git (Dec 2019, #02; Thu, 5)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

The third batch of topics are now in 'master'.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

[Graduated to "master"]

* dd/rebase-merge-reserves-onto-label (2019-11-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-11-21 at a6e4e5af0a)
 + sequencer: handle rebase-merges for "onto" message
 (this branch uses js/rebase-r-safer-label.)

 The logic to avoid duplicate label names generated by "git rebase
 --rebase-merges" forgot that the machinery itself uses "onto" as a
 label name, which must be avoided by auto-generated labels, which
 has been corrected.


* dl/range-diff-with-notes (2019-11-21) 10 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-11-25 at dd6dad97c1)
 + format-patch: pass notes configuration to range-diff
 + range-diff: pass through --notes to `git log`
 + range-diff: output `## Notes ##` header
 + t3206: range-diff compares logs with commit notes
 + t3206: s/expected/expect/
 + t3206: disable parameter substitution in heredoc
 + t3206: remove spaces after redirect operators
 + pretty-options.txt: --notes accepts a ref instead of treeish
 + rev-list-options.txt: remove reference to --show-notes
 + argv-array: add space after `while`

 "git range-diff" learned to take the "--notes=<ref>" and the
 "--no-notes" options to control the commit notes included in the
 log message that gets compared.


* dl/t5520-cleanup (2019-11-21) 15 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-11-27 at 523d920acf)
 + t5520: replace `! git` with `test_must_fail git`
 + t5520: remove redundant lines in test cases
 + t5520: replace $(cat ...) comparison with test_cmp
 + t5520: don't put git in upstream of pipe
 + t5520: test single-line files by git with test_cmp
 + t5520: use test_cmp_rev where possible
 + t5520: replace test -{n,z} with test-lib functions
 + t5520: use test_line_count where possible
 + t5520: remove spaces after redirect operator
 + t5520: replace test -f with test-lib functions
 + t5520: let sed open its own input
 + t5520: use sq for test case names
 + t5520: improve test style
 + t: teach test_cmp_rev to accept ! for not-equals
 + t0000: test multiple local assignment

 Test cleanup.


* ec/fetch-mark-common-refs-trace2 (2019-11-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-11-25 at c2b8e1546c)
 + fetch: add trace2 instrumentation

 Trace2 annotation.


* ep/guard-kset-tar-headers (2019-11-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-11-21 at 6c9574b01d)
 + kset.h, tar.h: add missing header guard to prevent multiple inclusion

 Code clean-up.


* hi/gpg-optional-pkfp-fix (2019-11-23) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-11-25 at b0d668176f)
 + gpg-interface: limit search for primary key fingerprint
 + gpg-interface: refactor the free-and-xmemdupz pattern
 (this branch is used by hi/gpg-use-check-signature.)

 The code to parse GPG output used to assume incorrectly that the
 finterprint for the primary key would always be present for a valid
 signature, which has been corrected.


* hv/assume-priumax-is-available-anywhere (2019-11-25) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-11-27 at caac4f633d)
 + git-compat-util.h: drop the `PRIuMAX` and other fallback definitions

 We have had compatibility fallback macro definitions for "PRIuMAX",
 "PRIu32", etc. but did not for "PRIdMAX", while the code used the
 last one apparently without any hiccup reported recently.  The
 fallback macro definitions for these <inttypes.h> macros that must
 appear in C99 systems have been removed.


* jc/azure-ci-osx-fix-fix (2019-11-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-11-25 at 7de6356e67)
 + ci(osx): update homebrew-cask repository with less noise

 CI jobs for macOS has been made less chatty when updating perforce
 package used during testing.


* jh/userdiff-python-async (2019-11-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-11-25 at 74e4a4ed9f)
 + userdiff: support Python async functions

 The userdiff machinery has been taught that "async def" is another
 way to begin a "function" in Python.


* jk/fail-show-toplevel-outside-working-tree (2019-11-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-11-25 at cd97ae38bc)
 + rev-parse: make --show-toplevel without a worktree an error

 "git rev-parse --show-toplevel" run outside of any working tree did
 not error out, which has been corrected.


* js/builtin-add-i (2019-11-18) 9 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-11-21 at caefa55b89)
 + built-in add -i: implement the `help` command
 + built-in add -i: use color in the main loop
 + built-in add -i: support `?` (prompt help)
 + built-in add -i: show unique prefixes of the commands
 + built-in add -i: implement the main loop
 + built-in add -i: color the header in the `status` command
 + built-in add -i: implement the `status` command
 + diff: export diffstat interface
 + Start to implement a built-in version of `git add --interactive`
 (this branch is used by js/builtin-add-i-cmds.)

 The beginning of rewriting "git add -i" in C.


* js/git-svn-use-rebase-merges (2019-11-23) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-11-25 at 9585fe30f8)
 + git svn: stop using `rebase --preserve-merges`

 Prepare further for "rebase --preserve-merges" deprecation.


* js/pkt-line-h-typofix (2019-12-02) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-12-02 at 8f36a354ae)
 + pkt-line: fix a typo

 Typofix.


* js/rebase-r-safer-label (2019-11-18) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-11-21 at 791d51b0d7)
 + rebase -r: let `label` generate safer labels
 + rebase-merges: move labels' whitespace mangling into `label_oid()`
 (this branch is used by dd/rebase-merge-reserves-onto-label.)

 A label used in the todo list that are generated by "git rebase
 --rebase-merges" is used as a part of a refname; the logic to come
 up with the label has been tightened to avoid names that cannot be
 used as such.


* mg/doc-submodule-status-cached (2019-11-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-11-25 at fa833392a3)
 + doc: document 'git submodule status --cached'

 "git submodule status" and "git submodule status --cached" show
 different things, but the documentation did not cover them
 correctly, which has been corrected.


* mg/submodule-status-from-a-subdirectory (2019-11-25) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-11-27 at 24cb2d79ff)
 + submodule: fix 'submodule status' when called from a subdirectory

 "git submodule status" that is run from a subdirectory of the
 superproject did not work well, which has been corrected.


* mh/clear-topo-walk-upon-reset (2019-11-25) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-11-27 at 15871c1c2a)
 + revision: free topo_walk_info before creating a new one in init_topo_walk
 + revision: clear the topo-walk flags in reset_revision_walk

 The revision walking machinery uses resources like per-object flag
 bits that need to be reset before a new iteration of walking
 begins, but the resources related to topological walk were not
 cleared correctly, which has been corrected.


* nl/reset-patch-takes-a-tree (2019-11-25) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-11-25 at 34dc348eaf)
 + reset: parse rev as tree-ish in patch mode

 "git reset --patch $object" without any pathspec should allow a
 tree object to be given, but incorrectly required a committish,
 which has been corrected.


* pb/submodule-update-fetches (2019-11-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-11-25 at 7736f98351)
 + doc: mention that 'git submodule update' fetches missing commits

 Doc update.


* pw/sequencer-compare-with-right-parent-to-check-empty-commits (2019-11-23) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-11-25 at a4e4f06286)
 + sequencer: fix empty commit check when amending

 The sequencer machinery compared the HEAD and the state it is
 attempting to commit to decide if the result would be a no-op
 commit, even when amending a commit, which was incorrect, and
 has been corrected.


* sg/test-bool-env (2019-11-23) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-11-27 at e1874e422f)
 + t5608-clone-2gb.sh: turn GIT_TEST_CLONE_2GB into a bool
 + tests: add 'test_bool_env' to catch non-bool GIT_TEST_* values

 Recently we have declared that GIT_TEST_* variables take the
 usual boolean values (it used to be that some used "non-empty
 means true" and taking GIT_TEST_VAR=YesPlease as true); make
 sure we notice and fail when non-bool strings are given to
 these variables.


* sg/unpack-progress-throughput (2019-11-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-11-25 at 0418db6a27)
 + builtin/unpack-objects.c: show throughput progress

 "git unpack-objects" used to show progress based only on the number
 of received and unpacked objects, which stalled when it has to
 handle an unusually large object.  It now shows the throughput as
 well.


* us/unpack-trees-fsmonitor (2019-11-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-11-27 at 4c06f74957)
 + unpack-trees: skip stat on fsmonitor-valid files

 Users of oneway_merge() (like "reset --hard") learned to take
 advantage of fsmonitor to avoid unnecessary lstat(2) calls.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* am/pathspec-f-f-checkout (2019-12-04) 7 commits
 - checkout, restore: support the --pathspec-from-file option
 - doc: restore: synchronize <pathspec> description
 - doc: checkout: synchronize <pathspec> description
 - doc: checkout: fix broken text reference
 - doc: checkout: remove duplicate synopsis
 - add: support the --pathspec-from-file option
 - cmd_add: prepare for next patch
 (this branch uses am/pathspec-from-file; is tangled with es/pathspec-f-f-grep.)

 A few more commands learned the "--pathspec-from-file" command line
 option.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* dl/lore-is-the-archive (2019-12-04) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-12-05 at c87e168cd6)
 + doc: replace LKML link with lore.kernel.org
 + RelNotes: replace Gmane with real Message-IDs
 + doc: replace MARC links with lore.kernel.org
 (this branch uses jk/lore-is-the-archive.)

 Publicize lore.kernel.org mailing list archive and use URLs
 pointing into it to refer to notable messages in the documentation.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* dl/rebase-with-autobase (2019-12-05) 5 commits
 - rebase: fix format.useAutoBase breakage
 - format-patch: teach --no-base
 - t4014: use test_config()
 - format-patch: fix indentation
 - t3400: demonstrate failure with format.useAutoBase

 "git rebase" did not work well when format.useAutoBase
 configuration variable is set, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* es/pathspec-f-f-grep (2019-12-04) 1 commit
 - grep: support the --pathspec-from-file option
 (this branch uses am/pathspec-from-file; is tangled with am/pathspec-f-f-checkout.)

 "git grep" learned the "--pathspec-from-file" command line
 option.

 Waiting for review response.


* rs/xdiff-ignore-ws-w-func-context (2019-12-05) 1 commit
 - xdiff: unignore changes in function context

 The "diff" machinery learned not to lose added/removed blank lines
 in the context when --ignore-blank-lines and --function-context are
 used at the same time.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ag/edit-todo-drop-check (2019-12-04) 2 commits
 - rebase-interactive: warn if commit is dropped with `rebase --edit-todo'
 - sequencer: move check_todo_list_from_file() to rebase-interactive.c
 (this branch uses ag/sequencer-todo-updates.)

 Allow the rebase.missingCommitsCheck configuration to kick in when
 "rebase --edit-todo" and "rebase --continue" restarts the procedure.

 Seems to break when merged to 'pu'.

[Stalled]

* mt/threaded-grep-in-object-store (2019-10-02) 11 commits
 - grep: move driver pre-load out of critical section
 - grep: re-enable threads in non-worktree case
 - grep: protect packed_git [re-]initialization
 - grep: allow submodule functions to run in parallel
 - submodule-config: add skip_if_read option to repo_read_gitmodules()
 - grep: replace grep_read_mutex by internal obj read lock
 - object-store: allow threaded access to object reading
 - replace-object: make replace operations thread-safe
 - grep: fix racy calls in grep_objects()
 - grep: fix race conditions at grep_submodule()
 - grep: fix race conditions on userdiff calls

 Traditionally, we avoided threaded grep while searching in objects
 (as opposed to files in the working tree) as accesses to the object
 layer is not thread-safe.  This limitation is getting lifted.

 Expecting a reroll.

* js/advise-rebase-skip (2019-10-23) 3 commits
 - commit: give correct advice for empty commit during a rebase
 - sequencer: export the function to get the path of `.git/rebase-merge/`
 - cherry-pick: add test for `--skip` advice in `git commit`

 The logic used in "git commit" to give hints and errors depending
 on what operation was in progress learned to distinguish rebase and
 cherry-pick better.

 Kicked back to 'pu'.

* vn/reset-deleted-ita (2019-07-26) 1 commit
 - reset: unstage empty deleted ita files

 "git reset HEAD [<pathspec>]" did not reset an empty file that was
 added with the intent-to-add bit.

 Expecting a reroll.


* jn/unknown-index-extensions (2018-11-21) 2 commits
 - index: offer advice for unknown index extensions
 - index: do not warn about unrecognized extensions

 A bit too alarming warning given when unknown index extensions
 exist is getting revamped.

 Expecting a reroll.


* jc/format-patch-delay-message-id (2019-04-05) 1 commit
 - format-patch: move message-id and related headers to the end

 The location "git format-patch --thread" adds the Message-Id:
 header in the series of header fields has been moved down, which
 may help working around a suspected bug in GMail MSA, reported at
 <CAHk-=whP1stFZNAaJiMi5eZ9rj0MRt20Y_yHVczZPH+O01d+sA@mail.gmail.com>

 Waiting for feedback to see if it truly helps.
 Needs tests.


* js/protocol-advertise-multi (2018-12-28) 1 commit
 - protocol: advertise multiple supported versions

 The transport layer has been updated so that the protocol version
 used can be negotiated between the parties, by the initiator
 listing the protocol versions it is willing to talk, and the other
 side choosing from one of them.

 Expecting a reroll.

* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2018-10-15) 1 commit
 - zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

* ds/commit-graph-delay-gen-progress (2019-11-27) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-12-05 at 9252a4b1b6)
 + commit-graph: use start_delayed_progress()
 + progress: create GIT_PROGRESS_DELAY

 One kind of progress messages were always given during commit-graph
 generation, instead of following the "if it takes more than two
 seconds, show progress" pattern, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ds/sparse-cone (2019-11-22) 19 commits
 - sparse-checkout: check for dirty status

 Management of sparsely checked-out working tree has gained a
 dedicated "sparse-checkout" command.

  (merged to 'next' on 2019-12-05 at 887d5559bb)
 + packfile.c: speed up loading lots of packfiles

 In a repository with many packfiles, the cost of the procedure that
 avoids registering the same packfile twice was unnecessarily high
 by using an inefficient search algorithm, which has been corrected.

 Hide lower-level verify_signed-buffer() API as a pure helper to
 implement the public check_signature() function, in order to
 encourage new callers to use the correct and more strict
 validation.

* ma/config-bool-valex (2019-11-14) 8 commits
 - builtin/config: die if "value_regex" doesn't canonicalize as boolean
 - builtin/config: warn if "value_regex" doesn't canonicalize as boolean
 - builtin/config: canonicalize "value_regex" with `--type=bool-or-int`
 - builtin/config: canonicalize "value_regex" with `--type=bool`
 - builtin/config: collect "value_regexp" data in a struct
 - builtin/config: extract `handle_value_regex()` from `get_value()`
 - t1300: modernize part of script
 - config: make `git_parse_maybe_bool_text()` public

 "git config" can be told to affect the existing entries that
 "match" the given value via its value_regex argument.  It learned
 to normalize the value set in the configuration and the value given
 from the command line before computing they "match", e.g. "true" in
 the configuration file can now match with "yes" given from the
 command line.

 Needs a bit more work?

 standard input or a named file, instead of taking it as the command
 line arguments.
