What's cooking in git.git (Dec 2014, #03; Mon, 15)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.

The 'next' branch has been rewound and rebuilt on top of 2.2; I
expect this to be a short and light cycle that would not add too
many new things.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

 + mergetools: stop setting $status in merge_cmd()
 + mergetool: simplify conditionals
 + difftool--helper: add explicit exit statement
 + mergetool--lib: remove use of $status global
 + mergetool--lib: remove no-op assignment to $status from setup_user_tool

 Code simplification.


* jc/unpack-trees-plug-leak (2014-11-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-12-04 at 9f1df30)
 + unpack_trees: plug leakage of o->result

 + t4026: test "normal" color
 + config: fix parsing of "git config --get-color some.key -1"
 + docs: describe ANSI 256-color mode
 (this branch is used by jk/colors.)


* jk/no-perl-tests (2014-11-18) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-12-04 at f166620)
 + t960[34]: mark cvsimport tests as requiring perl
 + t0090: mark add-interactive test with PERL prerequisite

 Some tests that depend on perl lacked PERL prerequisite to protect
 them, breaking build with NO_PERL configuration.


* jk/pack-bitmap (2014-11-30) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-12-04 at eb457ad)
 + pack-bitmap: do not use gcc packed attribute


* jk/push-simple (2014-11-30) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-12-04 at 00785c7)
 + push: truly use "simple" as default, not "upstream"

 Git 2.0 was supposed to make the "simple" mode for the default of
 "git push", but it didn't.


* jk/rebuild-perl-scripts-with-no-perl-seting-change (2014-11-18) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-12-04 at 27382d3)
 + Makefile: have python scripts depend on NO_PYTHON setting
 + Makefile: simplify by using SCRIPT_{PERL,SH}_GEN macros
 + Makefile: have perl scripts depend on NO_PERL setting

 The build procedure did not bother fixing perl and python scripts
 when NO_PERL and NO_PYTHON build-time configuration changed.


* mh/config-copy-string-from-git-path (2014-11-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-12-04 at 9c9518b)
 + cmd_config(): make a copy of path obtained from git_path()

  (merged to 'next' on 2014-12-04 at de7547a)
 + apply: fix typo in an error message

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* jk/test-asan (2014-12-11) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-12-15 at d24cb92)
 + t: support clang/gcc AddressSanitizer

 Will merge to 'master'.


* nd/split-index (2014-12-11) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-12-15 at ed6490c)
 + index-format.txt: add a missing closing quote

 A typofix to the documentation of a feature already in the release.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ch/new-gpg-drops-rfc-1991 (2014-12-12) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-12-15 at 32d7d50)
 + tests: squelch noise from GPG machinery set-up
 + tests: replace binary GPG keyrings with ASCII-armored keys
 + tests: skip RFC1991 tests for gnupg 2.1
 + tests: create gpg homedir on the fly

 Recent GPG changes the keyring format and drops support for RFC1991
 formatted signatures, breaking our existing tests.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jg/prompt-localize-temporary (2014-12-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-12-15 at bb9cac9)
 + git-prompt.sh: make $f local to __git_eread()

 "git-prompt" (in contrib/) used a variable from the global scope,
 possibly contaminating end-user's namespace.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/strbuf-doc-to-header (2014-12-12) 4 commits
 - strbuf.h: reorganize api function grouping headers
 - strbuf.h: format asciidoc code blocks as 4-space indent
 - strbuf.h: drop asciidoc list formatting from API docs
 - strbuf: migrate api-strbuf.txt documentation to strbuf.h

 Resolve the "doc vs header" to favor the latter.

 Expecting to be rerolled.


* mh/reflog-expire (2014-12-12) 24 commits
 - refs.c: let fprintf handle the formatting
 - refs.c: don't expose the internal struct ref_lock in the header file
 - lock_any_ref_for_update(): inline function
 - refs.c: remove unlock_ref/close_ref/commit_ref from the refs api
 - reflog_expire(): new function in the reference API
 - expire_reflog(): treat the policy callback data as opaque
 - Move newlog and last_kept_sha1 to "struct expire_reflog_cb"
 - expire_reflog(): move rewrite to flags argument
 - expire_reflog(): move verbose to flags argument
 - expire_reflog(): pass flags through to expire_reflog_ent()
 - struct expire_reflog_cb: a new callback data type
 - Rename expire_reflog_cb to expire_reflog_policy_cb
 - expire_reflog(): move updateref to flags argument
 - expire_reflog(): move dry_run to flags argument
 - expire_reflog(): add a "flags" argument
 - expire_reflog(): extract two policy-related functions
 - Extract function should_expire_reflog_ent()
 - expire_reflog(): use a lock_file for rewriting the reflog file
 - expire_reflog(): return early if the reference has no reflog
 - expire_reflog(): rename "ref" parameter to "refname"
 - expire_reflog(): it's not an each_ref_fn anymore
 - refs.c: add a function to append a reflog entry to a fd
 - refs.c: make ref_transaction_delete a wrapper for ref_transaction_update
 - refs.c: make ref_transaction_create a wrapper for ref_transaction_update

 Restructure "reflog expire" to fit the reflogs better with the
 recently updated ref API.

 Looked reasonable (except that ome shortlog entries stood out like
 a sore thumb).


* po/doc-core-ignorestat (2014-12-12) 1 commit
 - doc: core.ignoreStat clarify the --assume-unchanged effect

 Expecting a reroll.


* rs/use-strbuf-complete-line (2014-12-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-12-15 at d6426a0)
 + use strbuf_complete_line() for adding a newline if needed

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/add-i-read-error (2014-12-15) 1 commit
 - add--interactive: leave main loop on read error

 "git add -i" did not notice when the interactive command input
 stream went away and kept asking.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* pd/completion-filenames-fix (2014-12-15) 1 commit
 - Update documentation occurrences of filename .sh

 The top-of-the-file instruction for completion scripts (in contrib/)
 did not name the files correctly.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* rd/send-email-2047-fix (2014-12-15) 2 commits
 - send-email: handle adjacent RFC 2047-encoded words properly
 - send-email: align RFC 2047 decoding more closely with the spec

 "git send-email" did not handle RFC 2047 encoded headers quite
 right.

 Will merge to 'next'.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* pw/remote-set-url-fetch (2014-11-26) 1 commit
 - remote: add --fetch and --both options to set-url

 Expecting a reroll.


* ye/http-accept-language (2014-12-03) 2 commits
 . SQUASH???
 . http: send Accept-Language header if possible

 Breaks various people ($gmane/260903).


* ms/submodule-update-config-doc (2014-11-03) 1 commit
 - submodule: clarify documentation for update subcommand

 Needs a reroll ($gmane/259037).


* je/quiltimport-no-fuzz (2014-10-21) 2 commits
 - git-quiltimport: flip the default not to allow fuzz
 - git-quiltimport.sh: allow declining fuzz with --exact option

 "quiltimport" drove "git apply" always with -C1 option to reduce
 context of the patch in order to give more chance to somewhat stale
 patches to apply.  Add an "--exact" option to disable, and also
 "-C$n" option to customize this behaviour.  The top patch
 optionally flips the default to "--exact".

 Tired of waiting for an Ack; will discard.


* jc/push-cert-hmac-optim (2014-09-25) 2 commits
 - receive-pack: truncate hmac early and convert only necessary bytes
 - sha1_to_hex: split out "hex-format n bytes" helper and use it

 This is "we could do this if we wanted to", not "we measured and it
 improves performance critical codepath".

 Will perhaps drop.


* mt/patch-id-stable (2014-06-10) 1 commit
 - patch-id: change default to stable

 Teaches "git patch-id" to compute the patch ID that does not change
 when the files in a single patch is reordered. As this new algorithm
 is backward incompatible, the last bit to flip it to be the default
 is left out of 'master' for now.

 Nobody seems to be jumping up & down requesting this last step,
 which makes the result somewhat backward incompatible.
 Will perhaps drop.


* tr/remerge-diff (2014-11-10) 9 commits
 - t4213: avoid "|" in sed regexp
 - log --remerge-diff: show what the conflict resolution changed
 - name-hash: allow dir hashing even when !ignore_case
 - merge-recursive: allow storing conflict hunks in index
 - merge_diff_mode: fold all merge diff variants into an enum
 - combine-diff: do not pass revs->dense_combined_merges redundantly
 - merge-recursive: -Xindex-only to leave worktree unchanged
 - merge-recursive: internal flag to avoid touching the worktree
 - merge-recursive: remove dead conditional in update_stages()

 "log -p" output learns a new way to let users inspect a merge
 commit by showing the differences between the automerged result
 with conflicts the person who recorded the merge would have seen
 and the final conflict resolution that was recorded in the merge.

 Waiting for a reroll ($gmane/256591).


* hv/submodule-config (2014-11-11) 4 commits
 - do not die on error of parsing fetchrecursesubmodules option
 - use new config API for worktree configurations of submodules
 - extract functions for submodule config set and lookup
 - implement submodule config cache for lookup of submodule names

 Kicked back to 'pu' per request ($gmane/255610).


* ab/add-interactive-show-diff-func-name (2014-05-12) 2 commits
 - SQUASH??? git-add--interactive: Preserve diff heading when splitting hunks
 - git-add--interactive: Preserve diff heading when splitting hunks

 Waiting for a reroll.


* jn/gitweb-utf8-in-links (2014-05-27) 1 commit
 - gitweb: Harden UTF-8 handling in generated links

 $gmane/250758?


* ss/userdiff-update-csharp-java (2014-06-02) 2 commits
 - userdiff: support Java try keyword
 - userdiff: support C# async methods and correct C# keywords

 Reviews sent; waiting for a response.


* bg/rebase-off-of-previous-branch (2014-04-16) 1 commit
 - git-rebase: print name of rev when using shorthand

 Teach "git rebase -" to report the concrete name of the branch
 (i.e. the previous one).

 But it stops short and does not do the same for "git rebase @{-1}".
 Expecting a reroll.


* rb/merge-prepare-commit-msg-hook (2014-01-10) 4 commits
 - merge: drop unused arg from abort_commit method signature
 - merge: make prepare_to_commit responsible for write_merge_state
 - t7505: ensure cleanup after hook blocks merge
 - t7505: add missing &&

 Expose more merge states (e.g. $GIT_DIR/MERGE_MODE) to hooks that
 run during "git merge".  The log message stresses too much on one
 hook, prepare-commit-msg, but it would equally apply to other hooks
 like post-merge, I think.

 Waiting for a reroll.


* jc/graph-post-root-gap (2013-12-30) 3 commits
 - WIP: document what we want at the end
 - graph: remove unused code a bit
 - graph: stuff the current commit into graph->columns[]

 This was primarily a RFH ($gmane/239580).


* tg/perf-lib-test-perf-cleanup (2013-09-19) 2 commits
 - perf-lib: add test_perf_cleanup target
 - perf-lib: split starting the test from the execution

 Add test_perf_cleanup shell function to the perf suite, that allows
 the script writers to define a test with a clean-up action.

 Will hold.


* jc/show-branch (2014-03-24) 5 commits
 - show-branch: use commit slab to represent bitflags of arbitrary width
 - show-branch.c: remove "all_mask"
 - show-branch.c: abstract out "flags" operation
 - show-branch.c: lift all_mask/all_revs to a global static
 - show-branch.c: update comment style

 Waiting for the final step to lift the hard-limit before sending it out.

[Cooking]

* dm/compat-s-ifmt-for-zos (2014-12-04) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-12-15 at 0eb2fe6)
 + compat: convert modes to use portable file type values

 Long overdue departure from the assumption that S_IFMT is shared by
 everybody made in 2005.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/credential-quit (2014-12-04) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-12-15 at 4cfd999)
 + prompt: respect GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT to disable terminal prompts
 + credential: let helpers tell us to quit

 Credential helpers are asked in turn until one of them give
 positive response, which is cumbersome to turn off when you need to
 run Git in an automated setting.  The credential helper interface
 learned to allow a helper to say "stop, don't ask other helpers."
 Also GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT environment can be set to false to disable
 our built-in prompt mechanism for passwords.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* mg/branch-d-m-f (2014-12-09) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-12-15 at 8366f2c)
 + branch: allow -f with -m and -d
 + t3200-branch: test -M

 "git branch -d" (delete) and "git branch -m" (move) learned to
 honor "-f" (force) flag; unlike many other subcommands, the way to
 force these have been with separate "-D/-M" options, which was
 inconsistent.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* mg/doc-check-ignore-tracked-are-not-ignored (2014-12-04) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-12-15 at c50f748)
 + check-ignore: clarify treatment of tracked files

 Will merge to 'master'.


* rt/completion-tag (2014-12-04) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-12-15 at b03ee39)
 + completion: add git-tag options

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/for-each-reflog-ent-reverse (2014-12-05) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-12-15 at de71f08)
 + for_each_reflog_ent_reverse: turn leftover check into assertion
 + for_each_reflog_ent_reverse: fix newlines on block boundaries

 The code that reads the reflog from the newer to the older entries
 did not handle an entry that crosses a boundary of block it uses to
 read them correctly.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* po/doc-assume-unchanged (2014-12-09) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-12-15 at 646e77e)
 + gitignore.txt: do not suggest assume-unchanged
 + doc: make clear --assume-unchanged's user contract

 Fixes long-standing misunderstanding of what assume-unchanged is
 about.  Some text near what is removed by the bottom patch may also
 have to be removed.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* tb/t0027-eol-conversion (2014-12-05) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-12-15 at ba24e75)
 + t0027: check the eol conversion warnings

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/always-allow-large-packets (2014-12-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-12-15 at c3fb2c8)
 + pkt-line: allow writing of LARGE_PACKET_MAX buffers

 "git push" and "git fetch" did not communicate an overlong refname
 correctly.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/commit-date-approxidate (2014-12-11) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-12-15 at 047530e)
 + commit: always populate GIT_AUTHOR_* variables
 + commit: loosen ident checks when generating template

 Recent update to "git commit" broke amending an existing commit
 with bogus author/committer lines without a valid e-mail address.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/read-packed-refs-without-path-max (2014-12-10) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-12-15 at c6d6f56)
 + read_packed_refs: use skip_prefix instead of static array
 + read_packed_refs: pass strbuf to parse_ref_line
 + read_packed_refs: use a strbuf for reading lines

 Git did not correctly read an overlong refname from a packed refs
 file.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jn/doc-api-errors (2014-12-04) 1 commit
 - doc: document error handling functions and conventions

 For discussion.


* js/fsck-tag-validation (2014-12-09) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-12-15 at 455f26c)
 + index-pack: terminate object buffers with NUL
 + fsck: properly bound "invalid tag name" error message

 New tag object format validation added in 2.2 showed garbage
 after a tagname it reported in its error message.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* js/test-hashmap-squelch-gcc (2014-12-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-12-15 at a8da691)
 + test-hashmap: squelch gcc compiler warning

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ok/rebase-i-count-todo (2014-12-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-12-15 at 4a1f7ed)
 + Show number of TODO items for interactive rebase

 Will merge to 'master'.


* rw/apply-does-not-take-ignore-date (2014-12-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-12-15 at ded2f99)
 + git-am.txt: --ignore-date flag is not passed to git-apply

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/exec-cmd-system-path-leak-fix (2014-11-30) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-12-15 at f926ee5)
 + system_path(): always return free'able memory to the caller

 The function sometimes returned a non-freeable memory and some
 other times returned a piece of memory that must be freed.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/hook-cleanup (2014-12-01) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-12-15 at f5759d0)
 + run-command.c: retire unused run_hook_with_custom_index()

 Remove unused code.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jn/rerere-fail-on-auto-update-failure (2014-12-03) 2 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - rerere: error out on autoupdate failure

 Will be rerolled as a part of a larger series.


* js/push-to-deploy (2014-11-30) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-12-15 at ef8c99f)
 + t5516: more tests for receive.denyCurrentBranch=updateInstead
 + receive-pack: add another option for receive.denyCurrentBranch
 (this branch is used by jc/push-to-checkout.)

 "git push" into a repository with a working tree normally refuses
 to modify the branch that is checked out.  The command learned to
 optionally do an equivalent of "git reset --hard" only when there
 is no change to the working tree and the index instead, which would
 be useful to "deploy" by pushing into a repository.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/push-to-checkout (2014-12-01) 2 commits
 - receive-pack: support push-to-checkout hook
 - receive-pack: refactor updateInstead codepath
 (this branch uses js/push-to-deploy.)

 Extending the js/push-to-deploy topic, the behaviour of "git push"
 when updating the working tree and the index with an update to the
 branch that is checked out can be tweaked by push-to-checkout hook.

 Needs docs.


* lh/send-email-hide-x-mailer (2014-12-11) 4 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - test/send-email: --[no-]xmailer tests
 - SQUASH???
 - send-email: add --[no-]xmailer option

 "git send-email" normally identifies itself via X-Mailer: header
 in the message it sends out.  A new command line flag allows the
 header to be squelched.

 Will merge to 'next' after squashing the fixups.


* nd/list-files (2014-12-01) 19 commits
 - list-files: -M aka diff-cached
 - list-files -F: show submodules with the new indicator '&'
 - list-files: add -F/--classify

 - ls_colors.c: highlight submodules like directories
 - ls_colors.c: add a function to color a file name
 - ls_colors.c: parse color.ls.* from config file
 - ls_colors.c: add $LS_COLORS parsing code

 A new "git list-files" Porcelain command, "ls-files" with bells and
 whistles.


* nd/ls-tree-pathspec (2014-12-01) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-12-15 at 8da6e09)
 + t3102: style modernization
 + t3102: document that ls-tree does not yet support negated pathspec
 + ls-tree: disable negative pathspec because it's not supported
 + ls-tree: remove path filtering logic in show_tree
 + tree.c: update read_tree_recursive callback to pass strbuf as base

 "git ls-tree" does not support path selection based on negative
 pathspecs, but did not error out when negative pathspecs are given.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* rj/t0050-passes (2014-11-30) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-12-15 at f56c339)
 + t0050-*.sh: mark the rename (case change) test as passing

 Will merge to 'master'.


* rt/for-each-ref-spell-tcl-as-Tcl (2014-11-30) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2014-12-15 at c0fcefb)
 + for-each-ref: correct spelling of Tcl in option description

 Will merge to 'master'.


* sb/ref-transaction-reflog (2014-12-03) 2 commits
 . refs.c: rename transaction.updates to transaction.ref_updates
 . refs.c: rename the transaction functions
 (this branch uses sb/ref-transaction-unify-to-update.)

 - git_path(): be aware of file relocation in $GIT_DIR
 - path.c: group git_path(), git_pathdup() and strbuf_git_path() together
 - path.c: rename vsnpath() to do_git_path()
 - git_snpath(): retire and replace with strbuf_git_path()
 - path.c: make get_pathname() call sites return const char *
 - path.c: make get_pathname() return strbuf instead of static buffer

 A replacement for contrib/workdir/git-new-workdir that does not
 rely on symbolic links and make sharing of objects and refs safer
 by making the borrowee and borrowers aware of each other.

  (merged to 'next' on 2014-12-15 at 397e986)
 + approxidate: allow ISO-like dates far in the future
 + pass TIME_DATE_NOW to approxidate future-check

 Traditionally we tried to avoid interpreting date strings given by
 the user as future dates, e.g. GIT_COMMITTER_DATE=2014-12-10 when
 used early November 2014 was taken as "October 12, 2014" because it
 is likely that a date in the future, December 10, is a mistake.

 Loosen this and do not tiebreak by future-ness of the date when

 (1) ISO-like format is used, and
 (2) the string can make sense interpreted as both y-m-d and y-d-m.

* mb/enable-lib-terminal-test-on-newer-darwin (2014-11-14) 1 commit

 . Revert "grep: fix match highlighting for combined patterns with context lines"
 . grep: fix match highlighting for combined patterns with context lines

 rs/grep-color-words topic solves it in a different way.

 Will discard.


* jn/dedup-doc-header (2014-12-10) 2 commits
 . put string-list API documentation in one place
 . put strbuf API documentation in one place

 We would want to have an easy way for developers to learn about
 APIs, and also a way to encourage them to keep the API
 documentation up to date when they make changes.  Having header
 comments and API documentation duplicated in two different places
 risked them going out of sync.

 The approach taken by jk/strbuf-doc-to-header is the other way
 around, which people seem to prefer, so this is discarded.
