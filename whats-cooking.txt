What's cooking in git.git (Nov 2019, #04; Mon, 25)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

Quite a many topics are now marked to be merged to 'master', which
may happen sometime next week (I'll be mostly offline this week).
Please stop me if I mistakenly marked some that are not quite ready.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* ds/commit-graph-delay-gen-progress (2019-11-22) 2 commits
 - commit-graph: use start_delayed_progress()
 - progress: create GIT_PROGRESS_DELAY

 One kind of progress messages were always given during commit-graph
 generation, instead of following the "if it takes more than two
 seconds, show progress" pattern, which has been corrected.


* ds/sparse-cone (2019-11-22) 19 commits
 - sparse-checkout: check for dirty status
 - sparse-checkout: update working directory in-process for 'init'
 - sparse-checkout: cone mode should not interact with .gitignore

 dedicated "sparse-checkout" command.


* dl/range-diff-with-notes (2019-11-21) 10 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-11-25 at dd6dad97c1)

 "git range-diff" learned to take the "--notes=<ref>" and the
 "--no-notes" options to control the commit notes included in the
 log message that gets compared.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/azure-ci-osx-fix-fix (2019-11-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-11-25 at 7de6356e67)

* sg/unpack-progress-throughput (2019-11-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-11-25 at 0418db6a27)
 + builtin/unpack-objects.c: show throughput progress

 "git unpack-objects" used to show progress based only on the number
 of received and unpacked objects, which stalled when it has to
 handle an unusually large object.  It now shows the throughput as
 well.

 + gpg-interface: limit search for primary key fingerprint
 + gpg-interface: refactor the free-and-xmemdupz pattern

 The code to parse GPG output used to assume incorrectly that the
 finterprint for the primary key would always be present for a valid
 signature, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* hv/assume-priumax-is-available-anywhere (2019-11-25) 1 commit
 - git-compat-util.h: drop the `PRIuMAX` and other fallback definitions

 We have had compatibility fallback macro definitions for "PRIuMAX",
 "PRIu32", etc. but did not for "PRIdMAX", while the code used the
 last one apparently without any hiccup reported recently.  The
 fallback macro definitions for these <inttypes.h> macros that must
 appear in C99 systems have been removed.

 Will merge to 'next'.

* mg/doc-submodule-status-cached (2019-11-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-11-25 at fa833392a3)
 + doc: document 'git submodule status --cached'

 "git submodule status" and "git submodule status --cached" show
 different things, but the documentation did not cover them
 correctly, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* mg/submodule-status-from-a-subdirectory (2019-11-25) 1 commit
 - submodule: fix 'submodule status' when called from a subdirectory

 - revision: free topo_walk_info before creating a new one in init_topo_walk
 - revision: clear the topo-walk flags in reset_revision_walk

 The revision walking machinery uses resources like per-object flag
 bits that need to be reset before a new iteration of walking
 begins, but the resources related to topological walk were not
 cleared correctly, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* nl/reset-patch-takes-a-tree (2019-11-25) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-11-25 at 34dc348eaf)
 + reset: parse rev as tree-ish in patch mode

 "git reset --patch $object" without any pathspec should allow a
 tree object to be given, but incorrectly required a committish,
 which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* pw/sequencer-compare-with-right-parent-to-check-empty-commits (2019-11-23) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-11-25 at a4e4f06286)
 + sequencer: fix empty commit check when amending

 The sequencer machinery compared the HEAD and the state it is
 attempting to commit to decide if the result would be a no-op
 commit, even when amending a commit, which was incorrect, and
 has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* sg/assume-no-todo-update-in-cherry-pick (2019-11-24) 1 commit
 - sequencer: don't re-read todo for revert and cherry-pick

 While running "revert" or "cherry-pick --edit" for multiple
 commits, a recent regression incorrectly detected "nothing to
 commit, working tree clean", instead of replaying the commits,
 which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sg/test-bool-env (2019-11-23) 2 commits
 - t5608-clone-2gb.sh: turn GIT_TEST_CLONE_2GB into a bool
 - tests: add 'test_bool_env' to catch non-bool GIT_TEST_* values

 Recently we have declared that GIT_TEST_* variables take the
 usual boolean values (it used to be that some used "non-empty
 means true" and taking GIT_TEST_VAR=YesPlease as true); make
 sure we notice and fail when non-bool strings are given to
 these variables.

 Will merge to 'next'.

* js/advise-rebase-skip (2019-10-23) 3 commits
 - commit: give correct advice for empty commit during a rebase
 - sequencer: export the function to get the path of `.git/rebase-merge/`
 - cherry-pick: add test for `--skip` advice in `git commit`

 The logic used in "git commit" to give hints and errors depending
 on what operation was in progress learned to distinguish rebase and
 cherry-pick better.

 Kicked back to 'pu'.

 Expecting a reroll.


* jn/unknown-index-extensions (2018-11-21) 2 commits
 - index: offer advice for unknown index extensions
 - index: do not warn about unrecognized extensions

 A bit too alarming warning given when unknown index extensions
 exist is getting revamped.

 header in the series of header fields has been moved down, which
 may help working around a suspected bug in GMail MSA, reported at
 <CAHk-=whP1stFZNAaJiMi5eZ9rj0MRt20Y_yHVczZPH+O01d+sA@mail.gmail.com>

 Waiting for feedback to see if it truly helps.
 Needs tests.


* js/protocol-advertise-multi (2018-12-28) 1 commit

 used can be negotiated between the parties, by the initiator
 listing the protocol versions it is willing to talk, and the other
 side choosing from one of them.

 Expecting a reroll.

 (this branch is used by dd/rebase-merge-reserves-onto-label.)

 up with the label has been tightened to avoid names that cannot be
 used as such.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* dd/rebase-merge-reserves-onto-label (2019-11-20) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2019-11-21 at a6e4e5af0a)
 + sequencer: handle rebase-merges for "onto" message
 (this branch uses js/rebase-r-safer-label.)

 The logic to avoid duplicate label names generated by "git rebase
 --rebase-merges" forgot that the machinery itself uses "onto" as a
 label name, which must be avoided by auto-generated labels, which
 has been corrected.

 + fetch: avoid locking issues between fetch.jobs/fetch.writeCommitGraph
 + fetch: add the command-line option `--write-commit-graph`

 Fetching from multiple remotes into the same repository in parallel
 had a bad interaction with the recent change to (optionally) update
 the commit-graph after a fetch job finishes, as these parallel
 fetches compete with each other.  Which has been corrected.

 + clone: remove fetch_if_missing=0
 + fetch: remove fetch_if_missing=0

 "git fetch" codepath had a big "do not lazily fetch missing objects
 when I ask if something exists" switch.  This has been corrected by
 marking the "does this thing exist?" calls with "if not please do not
 lazily fetch it" flag.

* mt/threaded-grep-in-object-store (2019-10-02) 11 commits
 - grep: move driver pre-load out of critical section
 - grep: re-enable threads in non-worktree case

 - grep: allow submodule functions to run in parallel
 - submodule-config: add skip_if_read option to repo_read_gitmodules()
 - grep: replace grep_read_mutex by internal obj read lock

 - replace-object: make replace operations thread-safe
 - grep: fix racy calls in grep_objects()
 - grep: fix race conditions at grep_submodule()
 - grep: fix race conditions on userdiff calls

 Traditionally, we avoided threaded grep while searching in objects
 (as opposed to files in the working tree) as accesses to the object
 layer is not thread-safe.  This limitation is getting lifted.
