What's cooking in git.git (Aug 2021, #08; Mon, 23)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen',
which means nothing more than that I have found them of interest for
some reason (like "it may have hard-to-resolve conflicts with
another topic already in flight" or "this may turn out to be
useful").  Do not read too much into a topic being in (or not in)
'seen'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of the
integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

The tip of 'next' has been rewound, and the first batch of this
cycle should be in 'master' in a few days.  As discussed, let's make
'ort' the default early in this cycle.

Most notably, since the "errno cleanup around refs API" topics have
been blocking the "reftable backend" topic, I've reverted the former
out of 'next' and moved them to near the tip of 'seen', essentially
giving priority to the latter.  In other words, I'd expect to see
that the "reftable" topic to move before the "errno cleanup" topic,
and also expect that any breakage, when both are merged to 'seen',
would be resolved by adjusting the "errno cleanup" topic.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

 - git-p4: do not decode data from perforce by default
 - git-p4: avoid decoding more data from perforce

 "git p4" in Python-2 days used to accept a lot more kinds of data
 from Perforce server as uninterrupted byte sequence, but after
 switching to Python-3, too many things are expected to be in UTF-8,
 which broke traditional use cases.

 Waiting for reviews.

 - rebase --continue: remove .git/MERGE_MSG
 - rebase --apply: restore some tests
 - t3403: fix commit authorship

 Checking out all the paths from HEAD during the last conflicted
 step in "git rebase" and continuing would cause the step to be
 skipped (which is expected), but leaves MERGE_MSG file behind in
 $GIT_DIR and confuses the next "git commit", which has been
 corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ab/help-autocorrect-prompt (2021-08-14) 1 commit
 - help.c: help.autocorrect=prompt waits for user action

 - fixup! clone: set submodule.recurse=true if submodule.stickyRecursiveClone enabled
 - clone: set submodule.recurse=true if submodule.stickyRecursiveClone enabled

 After "git clone --recurse-submodules", all submodules are cloned
 but they are not by default recursed into by other commands.  With
 submodule.stickyRecursiveClone configuration set, submodule.recurse
 configuration is set to true in a repository created by "clone"
 with "--recurse-submodules" option.

 - t5607: avoid using prerequisites to select algorithm

 The current implementation of GIT_TEST_FAIL_PREREQS is broken in
 that checking for the lack of a prerequisite would not work.  Avoid
 the use of "if ! test_have_prereq X" in a test script.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/commit-edit-fixup-fix (2021-08-15) 1 commit

 - docs: clarify the interaction of transfer.hideRefs and namespaces
 - upload-pack.c: treat want-ref relative to namespace
 - t5730: introduce fetch command helper

 "git upload-pack" which runs on the other side of "git fetch"
 forgot to take the ref namespaces into account when handling
 want-ref requests.


* np/blame-ignore-revs-file-may-be-optional (2021-08-09) 1 commit
 - blame: add config `blame.ignoreRevsFileIsOptional`

 When the file named by blame.ignoreRevsFile configuration variable
 does not exist, it causes "git blame" to die.  Sometimes, it is
 useful if the files named by configuration variables can be made
 optional (it would allow ~/.gitconfig to give a filename, and make
 it effective only in repositories that have a file with that name).

 This uses an extra variable that marks that the variable is
 optional.  Yet another alternative is being discussed to define
 syntax for "optional" filename values, so that the same mechanism
 can be used for not just blame.ignoreRevsFile but other filenames.

 Queued just as a reminder of the theme.


* cb/ci-build-pedantic (2021-08-11) 1 commit
 - ci: run a pedantic build as part of the GitHub workflow

 CI update.

 Expecting a reroll.

 - sparse-index: add SPARSE_INDEX_IGNORE_CONFIG flag
 - attr: be careful about sparse directories
 - sparse-checkout: create helper methods
 - unpack-trees: fix nested sparse-dir search
 - sparse-index: silently return when cache tree fails
 - sparse-index: silently return when not using cone-mode patterns
 - t7519: rewrite sparse index test
 - Merge branch 'ds/add-with-sparse-index' into ds/sparse-index-ignored-files
 (this branch uses ds/add-with-sparse-index.)

 In cone mode, the sparse-index code path learned to remove ignored
 files (like build artifacts) outside the sparse cone, allowing the
 entire directory outside the sparse cone to be removed, which is
 especially useful when the sparse patterns change.


* jc/userdiff-pattern-hint (2021-08-11) 1 commit

 Remind developers that the userdiff patterns should be kept simple
 and permissive, assuming that the contents they apply are always
 syntactically correct.

* js/advise-when-skipping-cherry-picked (2021-08-10) 2 commits
 - SQUASH???
 - sequencer: advise if skipping cherry-picked commit

 "git rebase" by default skips changes that are equivalent to
 commits that are already in the history the branch is rebased onto;
 give messages when this happens to let the users be aware of
 skipped commits, and also teach them how to tell "rebase" to keep
 duplicated changes.


* jt/grep-wo-submodule-odb-as-alternate (2021-08-13) 8 commits
 - t7814: show lack of alternate ODB-adding
 - submodule-config: pass repo upon blob config read

 - grep: allocate subrepos on heap
 - grep: read submodule entry with explicit repo
 - grep: typesafe versions of grep_source_init
 - grep: use submodule-ODB-as-alternate lazy-addition
 - submodule: lazily add submodule ODBs as alternates

 The code to make "git grep" recurse into submodules has been
 updated to migrate away from the "add submodule's object store as
 an alternate object store" mechanism (which is suboptimal).


* ps/connectivity-optim (2021-08-09) 5 commits
 - revision: avoid hitting packfiles when commits are in commit-graph
 - commit-graph: split out function to search commit position
 - revision: stop retrieving reference twice
 - connected: do not sort input revisions
 - revision: separate walk and unsorted flags
 (this branch is used by ps/fetch-optim.)

 The revision traversal API has been optimized by taking advantage
 of the commit-graph, when available, to determine if a commit is
 reachable from any of the existing refs.

* jc/trivial-threeway-binary-merge (2021-07-28) 1 commit
 - ll-merge: teach ll_binary_merge() a trivial three-way merge

 The built-in merge driver for binary files learned to resolve
 trivial three-way merges (e.g. apply change, which turns A into B,
 to content A) by itself, which would help "git apply --3way" used

 The code to show progress indicator in a few code paths did not
 cover between 0-100%, which has been corrected.

* en/pull-conflicting-options (2021-07-22) 8 commits
 - pull: fix handling of multiple heads
 - pull: update docs & code for option compatibility with rebasing
 - pull: abort by default when fast-forwarding is not possible
 - pull: make --rebase and --no-rebase override pull.ff=only
 - pull: since --ff-only overrides, handle it first
 - pull: abort if --ff-only is given and fast-forwarding is impossible
 - t7601: add tests of interactions with multiple merge heads and config
 - t7601: test interaction of merge/rebase/fast-forward flags and options

 "git pull" had various corner cases that were not well thought out
 around its --rebase backend, e.g. "git pull --ff-only" did not stop
 but went ahead and rebased when the history on other side is not a
 descendant of our history.  The series tries to fix them up.

 Will merge to 'next'.
