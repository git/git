What's cooking in git.git (Nov 2021, #03; Tue, 9)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen',
which means nothing more than that I have found them of interest for
some reason (like "it may have hard-to-resolve conflicts with
another topic already in flight" or "this may turn out to be
useful").  Do not read too much into a topic being in (or not in)
'seen'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of the
integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

Git 2.34-rc2 has been tagged with a few more regression fixes.
Thank you all for finding, reporting and fixing them so quickly.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-vcs/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

Release tarballs are available at:

* ak/fetch-not-overwrite-any-current-branch (2021-11-08) 2 commits
 - receive-pack: protect current branch for bare repository worktree
 - fetch: protect branches checked out in all worktrees

 "git fetch" without the "--update-head-ok" option ought to protect
 a checked out branch from getting updated, to prevent the working
 tree that checks it out to go out of sync.  The code was written
 before the use of "git worktree" got widespread, and only checked
 the branch that was checked out in the current worktree, which has
 been updated.

 Reroll exists.


* jk/test-bitmap-fix (2021-11-05) 1 commit
 - test_bitmap_hashes(): handle repository without bitmaps

 The "merge" subcommand of "git jump" (in contrib/) silently ignored
 pathspec and other parameters.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 Last minute fix to the update already in 'master'.

 overly loose to upset OpenSSH (reported on an installation of Cygwin).

* mp/absorb-submodule-git-dir-upon-deinit (2021-10-07) 1 commit
 - submodule: absorb git dir instead of dying on deinit

 "git submodule deinit" for a submodule whose .git metadata
 directory is embedded in its working tree refused to work, until
 the submodule gets converted to use the "absorbed" form where the
 metadata directory is stored in superproject, and a gitfile at the
 top-level of the working tree of the submodule points at it.  The
 command is taught to convert such submodules to the absorbed form
 as needed.

 Expecting a reroll.

  (merged to 'next' on 2021-10-29 at ad4753e668)
 + pull: --ff-only should make it a noop when already-up-to-date

 "git pull --ff-only" and "git pull --rebase --ff-only" should make
 it a no-op to attempt pulling from a remote that is behind us, but
 instead the command errored out by saying it was impossible to
 fast-forward, which may technically be true, but not a useful thing
 to diagnose as an error.  This has been corrected.

 + Merge branch 'ns/tmp-objdir' into ns/batched-fsync
  (merged to 'next' on 2021-10-25 at e45c907d41)
 + core.fsyncobjectfiles: performance tests for add and stash
 + core.fsyncobjectfiles: tests for batch mode
 + unpack-objects: use the bulk-checkin infrastructure
 + update-index: use the bulk-checkin infrastructure
 + core.fsyncobjectfiles: add windows support for batch mode
 + core.fsyncobjectfiles: batched disk flushes
 + bulk-checkin: rename 'state' variable and separate 'plugged' boolean
 + Merge branch 'ns/tmp-objdir' into ns/batched-fsync
 (this branch uses ns/tmp-objdir.)

 The "core.fsyncobjectfiles" configuration variable can now be set
 to "batch" for improved performance.

 On hold.
