What's cooking in git.git (Oct 2011, #01; Tue, 4)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.

Here are the repositories that have my integration branches:

With maint, master, next, pu, todo, html and man:

	url = git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git
	url = https://code.google.com/p/git-core/

With only maint, master, html and man:

	url = git://git.sourceforge.jp/gitroot/git-core/git.git
	url = git://git-core.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/git-core/git-core

With all the topics and integration branches but not todo, html or man:

	url = https://github.com/gitster/git

Until kernel.org comes back to life, it might be a good idea to
tentatively have the following in your $HOME/.gitconfig:

    [url "http://code.google.com/p/git-core"]
	insteadOf = git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git

I am planning to kick some topics out of 'next' back to 'pu' to give them
a chance to be cleaned up. Not happened yet, but see below for ideas.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* cb/do-not-pretend-to-hijack-long-help (2011-10-03) 2 commits
 - fixup: leave uppercase H alone
 - use -h for synopsis and --help for manpage consistently

Will squash the top one into the original unless somebody objects.

* cp/git-web-browse-browsers (2011-10-03) 1 commit
 - git-web--browse: avoid the use of eval

Will merge to "next".

* il/archive-err-signal (2011-10-03) 1 commit
 - transport: do not allow to push over git:// protocol

Will merge to "next".

* nd/daemon-log-sock-errors (2011-10-03) 1 commit
 - daemon: log errors if we could not use some sockets

Will merge to "next".

* nd/document-err-packet (2011-10-03) 1 commit
 - pack-protocol: document "ERR" line

Will merge to "next".

* nd/git-daemon-error-msgs (2011-10-03) 1 commit
 - daemon: return "access denied" if a service is not allowed

Will merge to "next".

* jc/is-url-simplify (2011-10-03) 1 commit
 - url.c: simplify is_url()

Will merge to "next".

* jn/ident-from-etc-mailname (2011-10-03) 1 commit
 - ident: check /etc/mailname if email is unknown

Will merge to "next".

The warning might have to be squelched further, but that can be done as a
separate patch in-tree.

* jn/no-g-plus-s-on-bsd (2011-10-03) 1 commit
 - Makefile: do not set setgid bit on directories on GNU/kFreeBSD

Will merge to "next".

* js/log-show-children (2011-10-04) 1 commit
 - log --children

Will merge to "next".

* rs/name-rev-usage (2011-10-03) 1 commit
 - name-rev: split usage string

Will merge to "next".

* rs/test-ctype (2011-10-03) 2 commits
 - test-ctype: add test for is_pathspec_magic
 - test-ctype: macrofy

Will merge to "next".

* rs/pending (2011-10-03) 8 commits
 - commit: factor out clear_commit_marks_for_object_array
 - checkout: use leak_pending flag
 - bundle: use leak_pending flag
 - bisect: use leak_pending flag
 - revision: add leak_pending flag

 - Teach transport about the gitfile mechanism
 - Learn to handle gitfiles in enter_repo
 - enter_repo: do not modify input

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* hv/submodule-merge-search (2011-08-26) 5 commits
 - submodule: Search for merges only at end of recursive merge
 - allow multiple calls to submodule merge search for the same path
 - submodule: Demonstrate known breakage during recursive merge
 - push: Don't push a repository with unpushed submodules
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-08-24 at 398e764)
 + push: teach --recurse-submodules the on-demand option
 (this branch is tangled with fg/submodule-auto-push.)

The second from the bottom one needs to be replaced with a properly
written commit log message.

Will kick back to 'pu'.

* jc/signed-push (2011-09-12) 7 commits
 - push -s: support pre-receive-signature hook
 - push -s: receiving end
 - push -s: send signed push certificate
 - push -s: skeleton
 - Split GPG interface into its own helper library
 - rename "match_refs()" to "match_push_refs()"
 - send-pack: typofix error message
 (this branch uses jc/run-receive-hook-cleanup; is tangled with jc/signed-push-3.)

This was the v2 that updated notes tree on the receiving end.

* jc/signed-push-3 (2011-09-12) 4 commits
 . push -s: signed push
 - Split GPG interface into its own helper library
 - rename "match_refs()" to "match_push_refs()"
 - send-pack: typofix error message
 (this branch uses jc/run-receive-hook-cleanup; is tangled with jc/signed-push.)

This is the third edition, that moves the preparation of the notes tree to
the sending end.
I expect that both of these topics will be discarded.

* jk/add-i-hunk-filter (2011-07-27) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-08-11 at 8ff9a56)
 + add--interactive: add option to autosplit hunks
 + add--interactive: allow negatation of hunk filters
 + add--interactive: allow hunk filtering on command line
 + add--interactive: factor out regex error handling
 + add--interactive: refactor patch mode argument processing

Will discard.

* jh/receive-count-limit (2011-05-23) 10 commits
 - receive-pack: Allow server to refuse pushes with too many objects
 - pack-objects: Estimate pack size; abort early if pack size limit is exceeded
 - send-pack/receive-pack: Allow server to refuse pushing too large packs
 - pack-objects: Allow --max-pack-size to be used together with --stdout
 - send-pack/receive-pack: Allow server to refuse pushes with too many commits
 - pack-objects: Teach new option --max-commit-count, limiting #commits in pack
 - receive-pack: Prepare for addition of the new 'limit-*' family of capabilities
 - Tighten rules for matching server capabilities in server_supports()
 - send-pack: Attempt to retrieve remote status even if pack-objects fails
 - Update technical docs to reflect side-band-64k capability in receive-pack

Would need another round to separate per-pack and per-session limits.
Will discard.

* jk/generation-numbers (2011-09-11) 8 commits
 - metadata-cache.c: make two functions static
 - limit "contains" traversals based on commit generation
 - check commit generation cache validity against grafts
 - pretty: support %G to show the generation number of a commit
 - commit: add commit_generation function
 - add metadata-cache infrastructure
 - decorate: allow storing values instead of pointers
 - Merge branch 'jk/tag-contains-ab' (early part) into HEAD

The initial "tag --contains" de-pessimization without need for generation
numbers is already in.
Will discard.

* sr/transport-helper-fix-rfc (2011-07-19) 2 commits
 - t5800: point out that deleting branches does not work
 - t5800: document inability to push new branch with old content

Perhaps 281eee4 (revision: keep track of the end-user input from the
command line, 2011-08-25) in bk/ancestry-path would help.

* po/cygwin-backslash (2011-08-05) 2 commits
 - On Cygwin support both UNIX and DOS style path-names
 - git-compat-util: add generic find_last_dir_sep that respects is_dir_sep

Incomplete with respect to backslash processing in prefix_filename(), and
also loses the ability to escape glob specials.
Will discard.

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* jc/grep-untracked-exclude (2011-10-04) 1 commit
 - Merge branch 'jc/maint-grep-untracked-exclude' into jc/grep-untracked-exclude
 (this branch uses bw/grep-no-index-no-exclude and jc/maint-grep-untracked-exclude.)

* jc/maint-grep-untracked-exclude (2011-10-04) 1 commit
 - grep: teach --untracked and --exclude-standard options

Will merge to "next".

 - tree-walk: micro-optimization in tree_entry_interesting
 - tree-walk: drop unused parameter from match_dir_prefix

Will merge to "next".

 - use new Git::config_path() for aliasesfile
 - Add Git::config_path()

Will merge to "next".

* jc/checkout-from-tree-keep-local-changes (2011-09-30) 1 commit

Will merge to "next".

* jc/maint-diffstat-numstat-context (2011-09-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-09-26 at 12539ab)
 + diff: teach --stat/--numstat to honor -U$num

"diff" is allowed to match the common lines differently depending on how
many context lines it is showing, so running --(num)stat with 0 lines of
context internally gives a result that may be surprising to some people.

Will merge to "master" as the second wave.

Will merge to "master" as the first wave.

* mz/remote-rename (2011-09-11) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-09-26 at 5e64f68)
 + remote: only update remote-tracking branch if updating refspec

* jc/fetch-pack-fsck-objects (2011-09-04) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-09-12 at a031347)
 + test: fetch/receive with fsckobjects
 + transfer.fsckobjects: unify fetch/receive.fsckobjects
 + fetch.fsckobjects: verify downloaded objects

We had an option to verify the sent objects before accepting a push but
lacked the corresponding option when fetching. In the light of the recent
k.org incident, a change like this would be a good addition.

Will merge to "master" as the first wave.

* jc/fetch-verify (2011-09-01) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-09-12 at 3f491ab)
 + fetch: verify we have everything we need before updating our ref
 + rev-list --verify-object
 + list-objects: pass callback data to show_objects()
 (this branch uses jc/traverse-commit-list; is tangled with jc/receive-verify.)

During a fetch, we verify that the pack stream is self consistent,
but did not verify that the refs that are updated are consistent with
objects contained in the packstream, and this adds such a check.

Will merge to "master" as the first wave.

* jc/receive-verify (2011-09-09) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-09-12 at 856de78)
 + receive-pack: check connectivity before concluding "git push"
 + check_everything_connected(): libify
 + check_everything_connected(): refactor to use an iterator
 + fetch: verify we have everything we need before updating our ref
 + rev-list --verify-object
 + list-objects: pass callback data to show_objects()
 (this branch uses jc/traverse-commit-list; is tangled with jc/fetch-verify.)

While accepting a push, we verify that the pack stream is self consistent,
but did not verify that the refs the push updates are consistent with
