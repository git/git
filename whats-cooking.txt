What's cooking in git.git (May 2024, #09; Thu, 23)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and
aren't considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL
to a message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity (of course they can be resubmit when new interests
arise).

We unfortunately had serious regressions in 2.45.1 (and below, down
to 2.39 maintenance track are affected), and we are trying to assess
the extent of damage and which changes that went into the release to
revert.  We know about "git lfs" and "git annex" getting affected.
If your workflow is affected, you would want to try out 'seen' that
has proposed reverts to alleviate and report back to us, to make sure
that the next set of maintenance releases will fix the regressions
for you.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-scm/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/

* pw/rebase-i-error-message (2024-04-08) 2 commits
 - rebase -i: improve error message when picking merge
 - rebase -i: pass struct replay_opts to parse_insn_line()

 When the user adds to "git rebase -i" instruction to "pick" a merge
 commit, the error experience is not pleasant.  Such an error is now
 caught earlier in the process that parses the todo list.

 Expecting a reroll.
