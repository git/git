What's cooking in git.git (Jun 2010, #01; Wed, 2)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones
marked with '.' do not appear in any of the integration branches, but I am
still holding onto them.

Many topics that have been cooking since 1.7.1 pre-release freeze period
are now in master; maybe it is a good time to start freezing feature
branches for 1.7.2---I think I said I'll keep this cycle shorter, no?

Btw, fwiw, I recently took a position with Google.  The primary
development machine has been unpacked but I still haven't managed to get
back to speed yet.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* bs/userdiff-php (2010-05-23) 1 commit
 - diff: Support visibility modifiers in the PHP hunk header regexp

Will merge to 'next'.

* cc/maint-diff-CC-binary (2010-06-02) 2 commits
 - fixup
 - diff: fix "git show -C -C" output when renaming a binary file

The fix-up should probably be squashed in, as the original "fix" was
barking up a wrong tree.

* jn/gitweb-plackup (2010-05-28) 3 commits
 - git-instaweb: Add support for running gitweb via 'plackup'
 - git-instaweb: Wait for server to start before running web browser
 - git-instaweb: Remove pidfile after stopping web server
 (this branch uses ps/gitweb-soc.)

Will merge to 'next'.

* mg/status-b (2010-05-25) 2 commits
 - Documentation+t5708: document and test status -s -b
 - Show branch information in short output of git status

There are a few style violations that snuck in, but otherwise looked
sensible.

* ps/gitweb-soc (2010-05-28) 4 commits
 - git-instaweb: Configure it to work with new gitweb structure
 - git-instaweb: Put httpd logs in a "$httpd_only" subdirectory
 - gitweb: Set default destination directory for installing gitweb in Makefile
 - gitweb: Move static files into seperate subdirectory
 (this branch is used by jn/gitweb-plackup.)

Will merge to 'next'.

* tc/commit-abbrev-fix (2010-05-27) 3 commits
 - commit::print_summary(): set rev_info.always_show_header to 1
 - t7502-commit: add summary output tests for empty and merge commits
 - t7502-commit: add tests for summary output

Will merge to 'next'.  I am not quite happy about the "impossible to
trigger" die message, though.  It is a good defensive programming to catch
breakages caused by future changes that may invalidate the assumption this
patch makes, but then the message should be worded as such to state that
assumption, I think.

* ab/maint-perl-use-instlibdir (2010-05-30) 1 commit
 - Makefile: remove redundant munging of @@INSTLIBDIR@@

Will merge to 'next'.

 - Make --color-words work well with --graph
 - graph.c: register a callback for graph output
 - Emit a whole line in one go
 - diff.c: Output the text graph padding before each diff line
 - Output the graph columns at the end of the commit message
 - Add a prefix output callback to diff output

Will merge to 'next'.

 - revert: cleanup code for -x option

* gs/usage-to-stdout (2010-05-17) 1 commit
 - print the usage string on stdout instead of stderr

Will merge to 'next'.

 - Makefile: Tru64 portability fix
 - Makefile: HP-UX 10.20 portability fixes
 - Makefile: HPUX11 portability fixes

 - Do not use "diff" found on PATH while building and installing
 - enums: omit trailing comma for portability
 - Makefile: -lpthread may still be necessary when libc has only pthread stubs

 - Makefile: pass CPPFLAGS through to fllow customization

Will merge to 'next'.

Will merge to 'next'.

* jk/am-skip-hint (2010-05-30) 1 commit
 - git-am: suggest what to do with superfluous patches

Will merge to 'next'.

Will merge to 'next'.

* jn/maint-doc-ignore (2010-03-05) 1 commit
 - gitignore.5: Clarify matching rules

Will merge to 'next'.

 - rebase: improve error message when upstream argument is missing

Will merge to 'next'.

* ps/gitweb--browse-chrome (2010-05-30) 1 commit
 - git-web--browse: Add support for google chrome and chromium

Will merge to 'next'.

* bc/portable (2010-06-01) 5 commits

 - t/t7006: ignore return status of shell's unset builtin
 - t/t5150: remove space from sed script
 - git-request-pull.sh: remove -e switch to shell interpreter which breaks ksh
 - t/t5800: skip if python version is older than 2.5

* jc/t9129-any-utf8 (2010-06-02) 1 commit
 - t9129: fix UTF-8 locale detection

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled -- would discard unless there are some movements soon]

* jc/rev-list-ancestry-path (2010-04-20) 1 commit
 - revision: --ancestry-path

Just an illustration patch.  merge simplification logic used when
pathspecs are in effect interacts with this rather badly.

* js/rebase-origin-x (2010-02-05) 1 commit
 - [RFC w/o test and incomplete] rebase: add -x option to record original commit name

I retract my objection against the idea of -x; needs polishing before
moving forward.

* js/grep-open (2010-05-01) 3 commits
 - grep: do not ignore return value from chdir()
 - grep -O: allow optional argument specifying the pager (or editor)
 - grep: Add the option '--open-files-in-pager'
 (this branch is used by jp/hold-string-list-sanity.)

Probably needs to support --no-index mode as well.

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* em/checkout-orphan (2010-05-21) 5 commits
 - bash completion: add --orphan to 'git checkout'
 - t3200: test -l with core.logAllRefUpdates options
 - checkout --orphan: respect -l option always
 - refs: split log_ref_write logic into log_ref_setup
 - Documentation: alter checkout --orphan description

In <4BFE2461.5080501@drmicha.warpmail.net>, Michael J Gruber raised a
valid request for a better explanation of superfluous files left behind
and then are cleaned.  Other than that I think this is a sane thing to
do.

* ec/diff-noprefix-config (2010-05-02) 1 commit
 - diff: add configuration option for disabling diff prefixes.

Will merge to 'next'.

* jk/diff-m-doc (2010-05-08) 1 commit

Will merge to 'next'.

Will merge to 'next'.

* mg/rev-parse-lrbranches-locals (2010-05-14) 1 commit
 - revlist: Introduce --lrbranches and --locals revision specifiers
 (this branch uses mg/rev-parse-option-sifter-deprecation.)

Hmmm...

* mg/rev-parse-option-sifter-deprecation (2010-05-14) 3 commits
 - t6018: make sure all tested symbolic names are different revs
 - t6018: add tests for rev-list's --branches and --tags
 - rev-parse: deprecate use as an option sifter
 (this branch is used by mg/rev-parse-lrbranches-locals.)

Some people might interpret "Deprecate" too strongly; the intent is that
we shouldn't keep piling parsing of new rev-list options to it and
discourage the use of "option sifter" in new programs.

* ab/cvsserver (2010-05-15) 6 commits
 - git-cvsserver: test for pserver authentication support
 - git-cvsserver: document making a password without htpasswd

 . string_list: Fix argument order for string_list_append

 (this branch uses js/grep-open.)

Building this on top of slushy codebase is not a very promising endeavor.
Good thing to do, but it came at a bad time.
