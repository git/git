What's cooking in git.git (Aug 2016, #01; Tue, 2)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with
'-' are only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with
'+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

On the 'master' front, the individual commit count now exceeds 400
since the last major release, which is a good pace.  We may want to
start slowing down once the current crop of topics in 'next' hits
the 'master' and switch our attention to regression hunting.  The
'maint' branch has been accumulating enough material to make it the
next maintenance release v2.9.3.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches
of the repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* ab/gitweb-link-html-escape (2016-08-01) 1 commit
 - gitweb: escape link body in format_ref_marker

 The characters in the label shown for tags/refs for commits shown
 in "gitweb" output are now properly escaped for proper HTML output.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ew/build-time-pager-tweaks (2016-08-01) 1 commit
 . pager: move pager-specific setup into the build

 The build procedure learned PAGER_ENV knob that lists what default
 environment variable settings to export for popular pagers.  This
 mechanism is used to tweak the default settings to MORE on FreeBSD.

 Waiting for a reroll.


* ib/t3700-add-chmod-x-updates (2016-08-01) 3 commits
 - t3700: add a test_mode_in_index helper function
 - t3700: merge two tests into one
 - t3700: remove unwanted leftover files before running new tests

 The t3700 test about "add --chmod=-x" have been made a bit more
 robust and generally cleaned up.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jt/format-patch-from-config (2016-08-01) 1 commit
 - format-patch: format.from gives the default for --from

 "git format-patch" learned format.from configuration variable to
 specify the default settings for its "--from" option.


* rs/st-mult (2016-08-01) 1 commit
 - pass constants as first argument to st_mult()

 Micro optimization of st_mult() facility used to check the integer
 overflow coming from multiplication to compute size of memory
 allocation.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* rs/use-strbuf-addstr (2016-08-01) 1 commit
 - use strbuf_addstr() for adding constant strings to a strbuf

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sb/submodule-update-dot-branch (2016-08-01) 7 commits
 - submodule update: allow '.' for branch value
 - submodule--helper: add remote-branch helper
 - submodule-config: keep configured branch around
 - submodule--helper: fix usage string for relative-path
 - submodule update: narrow scope of local variable
 - submodule update: respect depth in subsequent fetches
 - t7406: future proof tests with hard coded depth

 A few updates to "git submodule update".

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jc/hashmap-doc-init (2016-08-02) 1 commit
 - hashmap: clarify that hashmap_entry can safely be discarded

 The API documentation for hashmap was unclear if hashmap_entry
 can be safely discarded without any other consideration.  State
 that it is safe to do so.

* jh/clean-smudge-annex (2016-08-01) 9 commits
 - use smudgeToFile filter in recursive merge
 - use smudgeToFile filter in git am
 - better recovery from failure of smudgeToFile filter
 - warn on unusable smudgeToFile/cleanFromFile config
 - use smudgeToFile in git checkout etc
 - use cleanFromFile in git add
 - add smudgeToFile and cleanFromFile filter configs
 - clarify %f documentation
 - Merge branch 'cc/apply-am' into HEAD
 (this branch uses cc/apply-am.)

 The interface to "clean/smudge" filters require Git to feed the
 whole contents via pipe, which is suboptimal for some applications.
 "cleanFromFile/smudgeToFile" commands are the moral equilvalents
 for these filters but they interact with the files on the
 filesystem directly.

 This is starting to bit-rot, as the topic it is built upon keeps
 getting rerolled.  I _think_ I rebased it correctly, but I would
 not be surprised if I made a mistake.

 Will discard if/when I have to do another rebase, preferring to
 have a fresh reroll directly from the author.


* sb/bisect (2016-04-15) 22 commits
 . SQUASH???
 . bisect: get back halfway shortcut

 . bisect: use a bottom-up traversal to find relevant weights
 . bisect: prepare for different algorithms based on find_all
 . bisect: rename count_distance() to compute_weight()
 . bisect: make total number of commits global
 . bisect: introduce distance_direction()

 . t: use test_cmp_rev() where appropriate
 . t/test-lib-functions.sh: generalize test_cmp_rev

 . bisect: write about `bisect next` in documentation

 The internal algorithm used in "git bisect" to find the next commit
 to check has been optimized greatly.

 Was expecting a reroll, but now pb/bisect topic starts removinging
 more and more parts from git-bisect.sh, this needs to see a fresh
 reroll.

 Will discard for now.

 . WIPWIP
 . WIP: diff-b-m
 - diffcore-rename: allow easier debugging
 - diffcore-rename.c: add locate_rename_src()
 - diffcore-break: allow debugging

 "git diff -B -M" produced incorrect patch when the postimage of a
 completely rewritten file is similar to the preimage of a removed
 file; such a resulting file must not be expressed as a rename from
 other place.

 The fix in this patch is broken, unfortunately.
 Will discard.

 "git am" has been taught to make an internal call to "git apply"'s

 Needs review.


* da/subtree-modernize (2016-07-27) 2 commits
 - subtree: adjust function definitions to match CodingGuidelines
 - subtree: adjust style to match CodingGuidelines
 (this branch uses da/subtree-2.9-regression.)

 Style fixes for "git subtree" (in contrib/).

 Will merge to 'next'.


* js/rebase-i-progress-tidy (2016-07-28) 1 commit
 - rebase-interactive: trim leading whitespace from progress count

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/t4205-cleanup (2016-07-27) 2 commits
 - t4205: indent here documents
 - t4205: drop top-level &&-chaining

 Test modernization.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/pack-objects-optim (2016-07-29) 7 commits
 - pack-objects: use mru list when iterating over packs
 - pack-objects: compute local/ignore_pack_keep early
 - pack-objects: break out of want_object loop early
 - find_pack_entry: replace last_found_pack with MRU cache
 - add generic most-recently-used list
 - sha1_file: drop free_pack_by_name
 - t/perf: add tests for many-pack scenarios

 "git pack-objects" has a few options that tell it not to pack
 objects found in certain packfiles, which require it to scan .idx
 files of all available packs.  The codepaths involved in these
 operations have been optimized for a common case of not having any
 non-local pack and/or any .kept pack.

 The last patch is still questionable in that it can attempt to
 create a cycle in delta-chain, only to be stopped by the last-ditch
 recovery logic in there.


* kw/patch-ids-optim (2016-07-29) 4 commits
 - rebase: avoid computing unnecessary patch IDs
 - patch-ids: add flag to create the diff patch id using header only data
 - patch-ids: replace the seen indicator with a commit pointer
 - patch-ids: stop using a hand-rolled hashmap implementation

 When "git rebase" tries to compare set of changes on the updated
 upstream and our own branch, it computes patch-id for all of these
 changes and attempts to find matches. This has been optimized by
 lazily computing the full patch-id (which is expensive) to be
 compared only for changes that touch the same set of paths.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/rebase-i-drop-ident-check (2016-07-29) 1 commit
 - rebase-interactive: drop early check for valid ident

 Even when "git pull --rebase=preserve" (and the underlying "git
 rebase --preserve") can complete without creating any new commit
 (i.e. fast-forwards), it still insisted on having a usable ident
 information (read: user.email is set correctly), which was less
 than nice.  As the underlying commands used inside "git rebase"
 would fail with a more meaningful error message and advice text
 when the bogus ident matters, this extra check was removed.

 Will hold.

* jk/reset-ident-time-per-commit (2016-08-01) 1 commit
 - am: reset cached ident date for each patch

 Not-so-recent rewrite of "git am" that started making internal
 calls into the commit machinery had an unintended regression, in
 that no matter how many seconds it took to apply many patches, the
 resulting committer timestamp for the resulting commits were all
 the same.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* da/subtree-2.9-regression (2016-07-26) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-07-26 at 9d71562)
 + subtree: fix "git subtree split --rejoin"
 + t7900-subtree.sh: fix quoting and broken && chains
 (this branch is used by da/subtree-modernize.)

 "git merge" in Git v2.9 was taught to forbid merging an unrelated
 lines of history by default, but that is exactly the kind of thing
 the "--rejoin" mode of "git subtree" (in contrib/) wants to do.
 "git subtree" has been taught to use the "--allow-unrelated-histories"
 option to override the default.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* nd/fetch-ref-summary (2016-07-26) 1 commit

 "git commit --help" said "--no-verify" is only about skipping the
 pre-commit hook, and failed to say that it also skipped the
 commit-msg hook.

 Will merge to 'master'.

* jk/diff-do-not-reuse-wtf-needs-cleaning (2016-07-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-07-28 at e3c5190)
 + diff: do not reuse worktree files that need "clean" conversion

 There is an optimization used in "git diff $treeA $treeB" to borrow
 an already checked-out copy in the working tree when it is known to
 be the same as the blob being compared, expecting that open/mmap of
 such a file is faster than reading it from the object store, which
 involves inflating and applying delta.  This however kicked in even
 when the checked-out copy needs to go through the convert-to-git
 conversion (including the clean filter), which defeats the whole
 point of the optimization.  The optimization has been disabled when
 the conversion is necessary.

 Will merge to 'master'.

* jk/parse-options-concat (2016-07-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-07-28 at 219bc3a)
 + parse_options: allocate a new array when concatenating

 Users of the parse_options_concat() API function needs to allocate
 extra slots in advance and fill them with OPT_END() when they want
 to decide the set of options to support dynamically, which is
 error-prone and hard to read.  This has been corrected by tweaking
 the API to allocate and return a new copy of "struct option" array.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 An earlier tweak to make "submodule update" retry a failing clone

 - push: allow pushing new branches with --force-with-lease
 - push: add shorthand for --force-with-lease branch creation
 - Documentation/git-push: fix placeholder formatting

 "git push --force-with-lease" already had enough logic to allow
 ensuring that such a push results in creation of a ref (i.e. the
 receiving end did not have another push from sideways that would be
 discarded by our force-pushing), but didn't expose this possibility
 to the users.  It does so now.

  (merged to 'next' on 2016-07-28 at 5606b14)
 + fetch-pack: grow stateless RPC windows exponentially

 "git fetch" exchanges batched have/ack messages between the sender
 and the receiver, initially doubling every time and then falling
 back to use the maximum window size.  The "smart http" transport,
 being an half-duplex protocol, outgrows the preset limit too
 quickly and becomes inefficient when interacting with a large
 repository.  The internal mechanism learned to grow the window size
 more aggressively when working with the "smart http" transport.

 - t5520: verify that `pull --rebase` shows the helpful advice when failing

 "git am -3" calls "git merge-recursive" when it needs to fall back
 to a three-way merge; this call has been turned into an internal
 subroutine call instead of spawning a separate subprocess.

 These mostly looked sensible, but it is dubious if it is a good
 feature to send what is meant to the standard error to the standard
 output.

 Eyes from other people are highly appreciated, as my eyes (and the
 original author's, too) have rotten by staring many rerolls of the
 same topic and are not effective in spotting errors.

 - log: decorate HEAD -> branch with the same color for arrow and HEAD

 An entry "git log --decorate" for the tip of the current branch is

 Needs review.


* jc/pull-rebase-ff (2016-07-28) 1 commit
 - pull: fast-forward "pull --rebase=true"

 "git pull --rebase", when there is no new commits on our side since
 we forked from the upstream, should be able to fast-forward without
 invoking "git rebase", but it didn't.

 Needs a real log message and a few tests.

 Clarify various ways to specify the "revision ranges" in the
 documentation.

 Updates in 4/8 ("give headings") is reported to break formatting?

* ex/deprecate-empty-pathspec-as-match-all (2016-06-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2016-07-13 at d9ca7fb)
 + pathspec: warn on empty strings as pathspec

 An empty string used as a pathspec element has always meant
 'everything matches', but it is too easy to write a script that
 finds a path to remove in $path and run 'git rm "$paht"', which
 ends up removing everything.  Start warning about this use of an
 empty string used for 'everything matches' and ask users to use a
 more explicit '.' for that instead.

 The hope is that existing users will not mind this change, and
 eventually the warning can be turned into a hard error, upgrading
 the deprecation into removal of this (mis)feature.

 Will hold to see if people scream.

* jc/blame-reverse (2016-06-14) 2 commits
 - blame: dwim "blame --reverse OLD" as "blame --reverse OLD.."
 - blame: improve diagnosis for "--reverse NEW"

 It is a common mistake to say "git blame --reverse OLD path",
 expecting that the command line is dwimmed as if asking how lines
 in path in an old revision OLD have survived up to the current
 commit.

 Any supporters?  Otherwise will drop.


* nd/shallow-deepen (2016-06-13) 27 commits
 - fetch, upload-pack: --deepen=N extends shallow boundary by N commits

 - transport-helper.c: refactor set_helper_option()
 - remote-curl.c: convert fetch_git() to use argv_array

 The existing "git fetch --depth=<n>" option was hard to use
 correctly when making the history of an existing shallow clone
 deeper.  A new option, "--deepen=<n>", has been added to make this
 easier to use.  "git clone" also learned "--shallow-since=<date>"
 and "--shallow-exclude=<tag>" options to make it easier to specify
 "I am interested only in the recent N months worth of history" and
 "Give me only the history since that version".

 Needs review.

 Rerolled.  What this topic attempts to achieve is worthwhile, I
 would think.

 - Merge branch 'jc/attr' into sb/submodule-default-paths
 (this branch uses jc/attr and sb/pathspec-label; is tangled with jc/attr-more.)

 Allow specifying the set of submodules the user is interested in on
 the command line of "git clone" that clones the superproject.

 (this branch is used by jc/attr-more, sb/pathspec-label and sb/submodule-default-paths.)

 The attributes API has been updated so that it can later be
 optimized using the knowledge of which attributes are queried.

 I wanted to polish this topic further to make the attribute
 subsystem thread-ready, but because other topics depend on this
 topic and they do not (yet) need it to be thread-ready, let's merge
 this early part together with the dependent topics to 'next', and
 back-burner the threading enhancement to another day.

 GSoC "bisect" topic.

 I'd prefer to see early part solidified so that reviews can focus
 on the later part that is still in flux.  We are almost there but
 not quite yet.


* sb/pathspec-label (2016-06-03) 6 commits
 - pathspec: disable preload-index when attribute pathspec magic is in use
 - pathspec: allow escaped query values
 - pathspec: allow querying for attributes
 - pathspec: move prefix check out of the inner loop
 - pathspec: move long magic parsing out of prefix_pathspec
 - Documentation: fix a typo
 (this branch is used by sb/submodule-default-paths; uses jc/attr; is tangled with jc/attr-more.)

 The pathspec mechanism learned ":(attr:X)$pattern" pathspec magic
 to limit paths that match $pattern further by attribute settings.
 The preload-index mechanism is disabled when the new pathspec magic
 is in use (at least for now), because the attribute subsystem is
 not thread-ready.


* kn/ref-filter-branch-list (2016-05-17) 17 commits
 - branch: implement '--format' option

 - ref-filter: include reference to 'used_atom' within 'atom_value'
 - ref-filter: implement %(if), %(then), and %(else) atoms

 The code to list branches in "git branch" has been consolidated
 with the more generic ref-filter API.

 Rerolled.
 This also really needs review.

 A new "index-helper" daemon has been introduced to give newly
 spawned Git process a quicker access to the data in the index, and
 optionally interface with the watchman daemon to further reduce the
 refresh cost.

 Not quite ready yet, it seems.

* jc/bundle (2016-03-03) 6 commits
 - index-pack: --clone-bundle option
 - Merge branch 'jc/index-pack' into jc/bundle
 - bundle v3: the beginning
 - bundle: keep a copy of bundle file name in the in-core bundle header
 - bundle: plug resource leak
 - bundle doc: 'verify' is not about verifying the bundle

 The beginning of "split bundle", which could be one of the
 ingredients to allow "git clone" traffic off of the core server
 network to CDN.

 While I think it would make it easier for people to experiment and
 build on if the topic is merged to 'next', I am at the same time a
 bit reluctant to merge an unproven new topic that introduces a new
 file format, which we may end up having to support til the end of
 time.  Comments?


* jc/merge-drop-old-syntax (2015-04-29) 1 commit
 - merge: drop 'git merge <message> HEAD <commit>' syntax

 Stop supporting "git merge <message> HEAD <commit>" syntax that has
 been deprecated since October 2007, and issues a deprecation
 warning message since v2.5.0.

 It has been reported that git-gui still uses the deprecated syntax,
 which needs to be fixed before this final step can proceed.
