What's cooking in git.git (Feb 2026, #02)
-----------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and
aren't considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL
to a message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity (of course they can be resubmit when new interests
arise).

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

Git 2.53 has been tagged.  Let's wait to see if there are regression
reports from the real world and then start the new cycle.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-scm/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

 - global: constify some pointers that are not written to

 ISO C23 redefines strchr and friends that tradiotionally took
 a const pointer and returned a non-const pointer derived from it to
 preserve constness (i.e., if you ask for a substring in a const
 string, you get a const pointer to the substring).  Update code
 paths that used non-const pointer to receive their results that did
 not have to be non-const to adjust.

 Transaction to create objects (or not) is currently tied to the
 repository, but in the future a repository can have multiple object
 sources, which may have different transaction mechanisms.  Make the
 odb transaction API per object source.

* hn/status-compare-with-push (2026-01-22) 3 commits
 - status: add status.compareBranches config for multiple branch comparisons
 - refactor format_branch_comparison in preparation
 - Merge branch 'jk/remote-tracking-ref-leakfix' into hn/status-compare-with-push
 (this branch uses jk/remote-tracking-ref-leakfix.)

 "git status" learned to show comparison between the current branch
 and its push destination as well as its upstream, when the two are
 different (i.e., triangular workflow).

 Under further discussion?

* ob/core-attributesfile-in-repository (2026-02-03) 3 commits
 - environment: move "branch.autoSetupMerge" into `struct repo_config_values`
 - environment: stop using core.sparseCheckout globally
 - environment: stop storing `core.attributesFile` globally

 The core.attributesfile is intended to be set per repository, but
 were kept track of by a single global variable in-core, which has
 been corrected by moving it to per-repository data structure.

* pw/replay-drop-empty (2025-12-18) 2 commits

 + replay: drop commits that become empty
 + Merge branch 'ps/history' into pw/replay-drop-empty
 (this branch uses ps/history.)

 "git replay" is taught to drop commits that become empty (not the
 ones that are empty in the original).

 On hold.  We need to figure out what to do with ps/history.
