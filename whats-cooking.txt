What's cooking in git.git (Sep 2020, #07; Fri, 25)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'seen' (formerly 'pu'---proposed updates) while commits prefixed
with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of
the integration branches, but I am still holding onto them.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches of the
repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

[Graduated to 'master']

* ds/maintenance-part-1 (2020-09-17) 11 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-18 at 4c367d3cf6)
 + maintenance: add trace2 regions for task execution
 + maintenance: add auto condition for commit-graph task
 + maintenance: use pointers to check --auto
 + maintenance: create maintenance.<task>.enabled config
 + maintenance: take a lock on the objects directory
 + maintenance: add --task option
 + maintenance: add commit-graph task
 + maintenance: initialize task array
 + maintenance: replace run_auto_gc()
 + maintenance: add --quiet option
 + maintenance: create basic maintenance runner
 (this branch is used by ds/maintenance-part-2 and ds/maintenance-part-3.)

 A "git gc"'s big brother has been introduced to take care of more
 repository maintenance tasks, not limited to the object database
 cleaning.


* hx/push-atomic-with-cert (2020-09-19) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-22 at 64561eea5b)
 + send-pack: run GPG after atomic push checking

 "git push" that wants to be atomic and wants to send push
 certificate learned not to prepare and sign the push certificate
 when it fails the local check (hence due to atomicity it is known
 that no certificate is needed).


* jk/diff-highlight-blank-match-fix (2020-09-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-22 at 03ac708501)
 + diff-highlight: correctly match blank lines for flush

 "diff-highlight" (in contrib/) had a logic to flush its output upon
 seeing a blank line but the way it detected a blank line was broken.


* jx/proc-receive-hook (2020-08-27) 10 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-18 at 344c89be7e)
 + doc: add documentation for the proc-receive hook
 + transport: parse report options for tracking refs
 + t5411: test updates of remote-tracking branches
 + receive-pack: new config receive.procReceiveRefs
 + doc: add document for capability report-status-v2
 + New capability "report-status-v2" for git-push
 + receive-pack: feed report options to post-receive
 + receive-pack: add new proc-receive hook
 + t5411: add basic test cases for proc-receive hook
 + transport: not report a non-head push as a branch

 "git receive-pack" that accepts requests by "git push" learned to
 outsource most of the ref updates to the new "proc-receive" hook.


* ld/p4-unshelve-fix (2020-09-19) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-22 at c7709a34ec)
 + git-p4: use HEAD~$n to find parent commit for unshelve
 + git-p4 unshelve: adding a commit breaks git-p4 unshelve

 The "unshelve" subcommand of "git p4" used incorrectly used
 commit^N where it meant to say commit~N to name the Nth generation
 ancestor, which has been corrected.


* rs/misc-cleanups (2020-09-19) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-22 at d034fbfab0)
 + pack-write: use hashwrite_be32() in write_idx_file()

 Code cleanup.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* cc/bisect-start-fix (2020-09-25) 1 commit

 corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* ah/pull (2020-09-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-25 at b5ddf0cf8b)
 + pull: don't warn if pull.ff has been set

 Earlier we taught "git pull" to warn when the user does not say the
 histories need to be merged, rebased or accepts only fast-
 forwarding, but the warning triggered for those who have set the
 pull.ff configuration variable.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jc/blame-ignore-fix (2020-09-24) 2 commits
 - blame: validate and peel the object names on the ignore list
 - t8013: minimum preparatory clean-up

 "git blame --ignore-rev/--ignore-revs-file" failed to validate
 their input are valid revision, and failed to take into account
 that the user may want to give an annotated tag instead of a
 commit, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* jk/make-protocol-v2-the-default (2020-09-25) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-25 at 21a5f9e880)
 + protocol: re-enable v2 protocol by default

 "git shortlog" has been taught to group commits by the contents of
 the trailer lines, like "Reviewed-by:", "Coauthored-by:", etc.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* js/cmake-vs (2020-09-25) 10 commits
 - hashmap_for_each_entry(): work around MSVC's run-time check failure #3
 - cmake (Windows): recommend using Visual Studio's built-in CMake support
 - cmake (Windows): initialize vcpkg/build dependencies automatically
 - cmake (Windows): complain when encountering an unknown compiler
 - cmake (Windows): let the `.dll` files are found when running the tests

 - cmake: fall back to using `vcpkg`'s `msgfmt.exe` on Windows
 - cmake: ensure that the `vcpkg` packages are found on Windows
 - cmake: do find Git for Windows' shell interpreter
 - cmake: ignore files generated by CMake as run in Visual Studio

 Using the CMake support we added some time ago for real with Visual
 Studio build revealed there were lot of usability improvements
 possible, which have been carried out.

 Expecting a reroll.

 The first step to remove on-disk binaries for built-in subcommands
 by soliciting objections.

 On hold for now.


* dr/push-remoteref-fix (2020-04-23) 1 commit
 - remote.c: fix handling of %(push:remoteref)

 The "%(push:remoteref)" placeholder in the "--format=" argument of
 "git format-patch" (and friends) only showed what got explicitly
 configured, not what ref at the receiving end would be updated when
 "git push" was used, as it ignored the default behaviour (e.g. update
 the same ref as the source).

 Discard for now.
 cf. <xmqqv9gu7c61.fsf@gitster.c.googlers.com>
 cf. <20200911214358.acl3hy2e763begoo@feanor>


* mk/use-size-t-in-zlib (2018-10-15) 1 commit
 - zlib.c: use size_t for size

 The wrapper to call into zlib followed our long tradition to use
 "unsigned long" for sizes of regions in memory, which have been
 updated to use "size_t".

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* rs/archive-add-file (2020-09-19) 3 commits
 - Makefile: use git-archive --add-file
 - archive: add --add-file
 - archive: read short blobs in archive.c::write_archive_entry()

 "git archive" learns the "--add-file" option to include untracked
 files into a snapshot from a tree-ish.


* js/default-branch-name-part-2 (2020-09-21) 5 commits
 - t9902: avoid using the branch name `master`
 - tests: avoid variations of the `master` branch name
 - t3200: avoid variations of the `master` branch name

* jt/keep-partial-clone-filter-upon-lazy-fetch (2020-09-21) 2 commits
 - fetch: do not override partial clone filter
 - promisor-remote: remove unused variable

 The lazy fetching done internally to make missing objects available
 in a partial clone incorrectly made permanent damate to the partial
 clone filter in the repository, which has been corrected.


* dl/diff-merge-base (2020-09-21) 10 commits
 - contrib/completion: complete `git diff --merge-base`
 - builtin/diff-tree: learn --merge-base

 - git-diff-index.txt: make --cached description a proper sentence
 - t4068: remove unnecessary >tmp

 "git diff A...B" learned "git diff --merge-base A B", which is a
 longer short-hand to say the same thing.

 Expecting a reroll.
 cf. <xmqqblhyepup.fsf@gitster.c.googlers.com>


* bc/faq-misc (2020-09-20) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-22 at a81b728010)
 + docs: explain how to deal with files that are always modified
 + docs: explain why reverts are not always applied on merge
 + docs: explain why squash merges are broken with long-running branches

 Will merge to 'master'.


* sb/clone-origin (2020-09-11) 4 commits
 - clone: allow configurable default for `-o`/`--origin`
 - clone: validate --origin option before use
 - clone: call git_config before parse_options
 - clone: add tests for --template and some disallowed option pairs

 "git clone" learned clone.defaultremotename configuration variable
 to customize what nickname to use to call the remote the repository
 was cloned from.

 Expecting an update.


* sk/force-if-includes (2020-09-23) 3 commits
 - t, doc: update tests, reference for "--force-if-includes"
 - push: parse and set flag for "--force-if-includes"
 - push: add reflog check for "--force-if-includes"

 "git push --force-with-lease[=<ref>]" can easily be misused to lose
 commits unless the user takes good care of their own "git fetch".
 A new option "--force-if-includes" attempts to ensure that what is
 being force-pushed was created after examining the commit at the
 tip of the remote ref that is about to be force-replaced.

 Expecting a reroll.
 cf. <20200923112606.GA71705@mail.clickyotomy.dev>


* ab/mediawiki-fixes (2020-09-21) 18 commits

* bc/clone-with-git-default-hash-fix (2020-09-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-22 at 62ea45c20e)
 + builtin/clone: avoid failure with GIT_DEFAULT_HASH

 "git clone" that clones from SHA-1 repository, while
 GIT_DEFAULT_HASH set to use SHA-256 already, resulted in an
 unusable repository that half-claims to be SHA-256 repository
 with SHA-1 objects and refs.  This has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 or relative path.

 Expecting a reroll.

 + commit-graph: pass a 'struct repository *' in more places
 + t4216: use an '&&'-chain
 + commit-graph: introduce 'get_bloom_filter_settings()'

 "git commit-graph write" learned to limit the number of bloom
 filters that are computed from scratch with the --max-new-filters
 option.

 Will merge to 'master'.

 Allow the configuration to specify no abbreviation regardless of
 the hash algorithm.

 Expecting a reroll.  The intent is very good.


* mr/bisect-in-c-2 (2020-09-24) 6 commits
 - bisect--helper: reimplement `bisect_next` and `bisect_auto_next` shell functions in C
 - bisect: call 'clear_commit_marks_all()' in 'bisect_next_all()'

 Rewrite of the "git bisect" script in C continues.

 Will merge to 'next'.
 At v9.  Looking good so far.


* js/no-builtins-on-disk-option (2020-09-21) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2020-09-25 at 6b976da4d2)
 + ci: stop linking built-ins to the dashed versions
 + Optionally skip linking/copying the built-ins
 + msvc: copy the correct `.pdb` files in the Makefile target `install`

 The installation procedure learned to optionally omit "git-foo"
 executable files for each 'foo' built-in subcommand, which are only
 required by old timers that still rely on the age old promise that
 prepending "git --exec-path" output to PATH early in their script
 will keep the "git-foo" calls they wrote working.

 The old attempt to remove these executables from the disk failed in
 the 1.6 era; it may be worth attempting again, but I think it is
 worth to keep this topic separate from such a policy change to help
 it graduate early.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* jk/refspecs-negative (2020-09-25) 1 commit
