List of maintainers
===================

Descriptions of section entries and preferred order
---------------------------------------------------

	M: *Mail* patches to: FullName <address@domain>
	R: Designated *Reviewer*: FullName <address@domain>
	   These reviewers should be CCed on patches.
	L: *Mailing list* that is relevant to this area
	S: *Status*, one of the following:
	   Supported:	Someone is actually paid to look after this.
	   Maintained:	Someone actually looks after it.
	   Odd Fixes:	It has a maintainer but they don't have time to do
			much other than throw the odd patch in. See below..
	   Orphan:	No current maintainer [but maybe you could take the
			role as you write your new code].
	   Obsolete:	Old code. Something tagged obsolete generally means
			it has been replaced by a better system and you
			should be using that.
	W: *Web-page* with status/info
	Q: *Patchwork* web based patch tracking system site
	B: URI for where to file *bugs*. A web-page with detailed bug
	   filing info, a direct bug tracker link, or a mailto: URI.
	C: URI for *chat* protocol, server and channel where developers
	   usually hang out, for example irc://server/channel.
	P: *Subsystem Profile* document for more details submitting
	   patches to the given subsystem. This is either an in-tree file,
	   or a URI. See Documentation/maintainer/maintainer-entry-profile.rst
	   for details.
	T: *SCM* tree type and location.
	   Type is one of: git, hg, quilt, stgit, topgit
	F: *Files* and directories wildcard patterns.
	   A trailing slash includes all files and subdirectory files.
	   F:	drivers/net/	all files in and below drivers/net
	   F:	drivers/net/*	all files in drivers/net, but not below
	   F:	*/net/*		all files in "any top level directory"/net
	   One pattern per line.  Multiple F: lines acceptable.
	X: *Excluded* files and directories that are NOT maintained, same
	   rules as F:. Files exclusions are tested before file matches.
	   Can be useful for excluding a specific subdirectory, for instance:
	   F:	net/
	   X:	net/ipv6/
	   matches all files in and below net excluding net/ipv6/
	N: Files and directories *Regex* patterns.
	   N:	[^a-z]tegra	all files whose path contains tegra
	                        (not including files like integrator)
	   One pattern per line.  Multiple N: lines acceptable.
	   scripts/get_maintainer.pl has different behavior for files that
	   match F: pattern and matches of N: patterns.  By default,
	   get_maintainer will not look at git log history when an F: pattern
	   match occurs.  When an N: match occurs, git log history is used
	   to also notify the people that have git commit signatures.
	K: *Content regex* (perl extended) pattern match in a patch or file.
	   For instance:
	   K: of_get_profile
	      matches patches or files that contain "of_get_profile"
	   K: \b(printk|pr_(info|err))\b
	      matches patches or files that contain one or more of the words
	      printk, pr_info or pr_err
	   One regex pattern per line.  Multiple K: lines acceptable.
