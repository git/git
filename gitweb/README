GIT web Interface
=================

The one working on:
  http://www.kernel.org/git/

From the git version 1.4.0 gitweb is bundled with git.


How to configure gitweb for your local system
---------------------------------------------

See also "Build time configuration" section in INSTALL
file for gitweb (in gitweb/INSTALL).

You can specify the following configuration variables when building GIT:
 * GIT_BINDIR
   Points out where to find git executable.  You should set up it to
   the place where git binary was installed (usually /usr/bin) if you
   don't install git from sources together with gitweb.  [Default: $(bindir)]
 * GITWEB_SITENAME
   Shown in the title of all generated pages, defaults to the server name
   (SERVER_NAME CGI environment variable) if not set. [No default]
 * GITWEB_PROJECTROOT
   The root directory for all projects shown by gitweb. Must be set
   correctly for gitweb to find repositories to display.  See also
   "Gitweb repositories" in INSTALL file for gitweb.  [Default: /pub/git]
 * GITWEB_PROJECT_MAXDEPTH
   The filesystem traversing limit for getting projects list; the number
   is taken as depth relative to the projectroot.  It is used when
   GITWEB_LIST is a directory (or is not set; then project root is used).
   Is is meant to speed up project listing on large work trees by limiting
   find depth.  [Default: 2007]
 * GITWEB_LIST
   Points to a directory to scan for projects (defaults to project root
   if not set / if empty) or to a file with explicit listing of projects
   (together with projects' ownership). See "Generating projects list
   using gitweb" in INSTALL file for gitweb to find out how to generate
   such file from scan of a directory. [No default, which means use root
   directory for projects]
 * GITWEB_EXPORT_OK
   Show repository only if this file exists (in repository).  Only
   effective if this variable evaluates to true.  [No default / Not set]
 * GITWEB_STRICT_EXPORT
   Only allow viewing of repositories also shown on the overview page.
   This for example makes GITWEB_EXPORT_OK to decide if repository is
   available and not only if it is shown.  If GITWEB_LIST points to
   file with list of project, only those repositories listed would be
   available for gitweb.  [No default]
 * GITWEB_HOMETEXT
   Points to an .html file which is included on the gitweb project
   overview page ('projects_list' view), if it exists.  Relative to
   gitweb.cgi script.  [Default: indextext.html]
 * GITWEB_SITE_HEADER
   Filename of html text to include at top of each page.  Relative to
   gitweb.cgi script.  [No default]
 * GITWEB_SITE_FOOTER
   Filename of html text to include at bottom of each page.  Relative to
   gitweb.cgi script.  [No default]
 * GITWEB_HOME_LINK_STR
   String of the home link on top of all pages, leading to $home_link
   (usually main gitweb page, which means projects list).  Used as first
   part of gitweb view "breadcrumb trail": <home> / <project> / <view>.
   [Default: projects]
 * GITWEB_SITENAME
   Name of your site or organization to appear in page titles.  Set it
   to something descriptive for clearer bookmarks etc.  If not set
   (if empty) gitweb uses "$SERVER_NAME Git", or "Untitled Git" if
   SERVER_NAME CGI environment variable is not set (e.g. if running
   gitweb as standalone script).  [No default]
 * GITWEB_BASE_URL
   Git base URLs used for URL to where fetch project from, i.e. full
   URL is "$git_base_url/$project".  Shown on projects summary page.
   Repository URL for project can be also configured per repository; this
   takes precendence over URL composed from base URL and project name.
   Note that you can setup multiple base URLs (for example one for
   git:// protocol access, one for http:// access) from gitweb config
   file.  [No default]
 * GITWEB_CSS
   Points to the location where you put gitweb.css on your web server
   (or to be more generic URI of gitweb stylesheet).  Relative to base
   URI of gitweb.  Note that you can setup multiple stylesheets from
   gitweb config file.  [Default: gitweb.css]
 * GITWEB_LOGO
   Points to the location where you put git-logo.png on your web server
   (or to be more generic URI of logo, 72x27 size, displayed in top right
   corner of each gitweb page, and used as logo for Atom feed).  Relative
   to base URI of gitweb.  [Default: git-logo.png]
 * GITWEB_FAVICON
   Points to the location where you put git-favicon.png on your web server
   (or to be more generic URI of favicon, assumed to be image/png type;
   web browsers that support favicons (website icons) may display them
   in the browser's URL bar and next to site name in bookmarks).  Relative
   to base URI of gitweb.  [Default: git-favicon.png]
 * GITWEB_CONFIG
   This Perl file will be loaded using 'do' and can be used to override any
   of the options above as well as some other options -- see the "Runtime
   gitweb configuration" section below, and top of 'gitweb.cgi' for their
   full list and description.  If the environment variable GITWEB_CONFIG
   is set when gitweb.cgi is executed, then the file specified in the
   environment variable will be loaded instead of the file specified
   when gitweb.cgi was created.  [Default: gitweb_config.perl]


Runtime gitweb configuration
----------------------------

You can adjust gitweb behaviour using the file specified in `GITWEB_CONFIG`
(defaults to 'gitweb_config.perl' in the same directory as the CGI).
The most notable thing that is not configurable at compile time are the
optional features, stored in the '%features' variable.

Ultimate description on how to reconfigure the default features setting
in your `GITWEB_CONFIG` or per-project in `project.git/config` can be found
as comments inside 'gitweb.cgi'.

See also "Gitweb config file" (with example of gitweb config file), and
"Gitweb repositories" sections in INSTALL file for gitweb.


Gitweb config file is [fragment] of perl code. You can set variables
using "our $variable = value"; text from "#" character until the end
of a line is ignored. See perlsyn(1) man page for details.

Below there is list of vaiables which you might want to set in gitweb config.
See the top of 'gitweb.cgi' for the full list of variables and their
descriptions.

Gitweb config file variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can set, among others, the following variables in gitweb config files
(with the exception of $projectroot and $projects_list this list does
not include variables usually directly set during build):
 * $GIT
   Cure git executable to use.  By default set to "$GIT_BINDIR/git", which
   in turn is by default set to "$(bindir)/git".  If you use git from binary
   package, set this to "/usr/bin/git".  This can just be "git" if your
   webserver has a sensible PATH.  If you have multiple git versions
   installed it can be used to choose which one to use.
 * $version
   Gitweb version, set automatically when creating gitweb.cgi from
   gitweb.perl. You might want to modify it if you are running modified
   gitweb.
 * $projectroot
   Absolute filesystem path which will be prepended to project path;
   the path to repository is $projectroot/$project.  Set to
   $GITWEB_PROJECTROOT during installation.  This variable have to be
   set correctly for gitweb to find repositories.
 * $projects_list
   Source of projects list, either directory to scan, or text file
   with list of repositories (in the "<URI-encoded repository path> SPC
   <URI-encoded repository owner>" format).  Set to $GITWEB_LIST
   during installation.  If empty, $projectroot is used to scan for
   repositories.
 * $my_url, $my_uri
   URL and absolute URL of gitweb script; you might need to set those
   variables if you are using 'pathinfo' feature: see also below.
 * $home_link
   Target of the home link on top of all pages (the first part of view
   "breadcrumbs").  By default set to absolute URI of a page; you might
   need to set it up to [base] gitweb URI if you use 'pathinfo' feature
   (alternative format of the URLs, with project name embedded directly
   in the path part of URL).
 * @stylesheets
   List of URIs of stylesheets (relative to base URI of a page). You
   might specify more than one stylesheet, for example use gitweb.css
   as base, with site specific modifications in separate stylesheet
   to make it easier to upgrade gitweb. You can add 'site' stylesheet
   for example by using
      push @stylesheets, "gitweb-site.css";
   in gitweb config file.
 * $logo_url, $logo_label
   URI and label (title) of GIT logo link (or your site logo, if you choose
   to use different logo image). By default they point to git homepage;
   in the past they pointed to git documentation at www.kernel.org.
 * $projects_list_description_width
   The width (in characters) of the projects list "Description" column.
   Longer descriptions will be cut (trying to cut at word boundary);
   full description is available as 'title' attribute (usually shown on
   mouseover).  By default set to 25, which might be too small if you
   use long project descriptions.
 * @git_base_url_list
   List of git base URLs used for URL to where fetch project from, shown
   in project summary page.  Full URL is "$git_base_url/$project".
   You can setup multiple base URLs (for example one for  git:// protocol
   access, and one for http:// "dumb" protocol access).  Note that per
   repository configuration in 'cloneurl' file, or as values of gitweb.url
   project config.
 * $default_blob_plain_mimetype
   Default mimetype for blob_plain (raw) view, if mimetype checking
   doesn't result in some other type; by default 'text/plain'.
 * $default_text_plain_charset
   Default charset for text files. If not set, web serwer configuration
   would be used.
 * $mimetypes_file
   File to use for (filename extension based) guessing of MIME types before
   trying /etc/mime.types. Path, if relative, is taken currently as taken
   relative to current git repositoy.
 * $fallback_encoding
   Gitweb assumes this charset if line contains non-UTF-8 characters.
   Fallback decoding is used without error checking, so it can be even
   'utf-8'. Value mist be valid encodig; see Encoding::Supported(3pm) man
   page for a list.   By default 'latin1', aka. 'iso-8859-1'.
 * @diff_opts
   Rename detection options for git-diff and git-diff-tree. By default
   ('-M'); set it to ('-C') or ('-C', '-C') to also detect copies, or
   set it to () if you don't want to have renames detection.

Per-repository gitweb configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also configure individual repositories shown in gitweb by creating
file in the GIT_DIR of git repository, or by setting some repo configuration
variable (in GIT_DIR/config).

You can use the following files in repository:
 * README.html
   A .html file (HTML fragment) which is included on the gitweb project
   summary page inside <div> block element. You can use it for longer
   description of a project, to provide links for example to projects
   homepage, etc.
 * description (or gitweb.description)
   Short (shortened by default to 25 characters in the projects list page)
   single line description of a project (of a repository). Plain text file;
   HTML will be escaped. By default set to
     Unnamed repository; edit this file to name it for gitweb.
   from the template during creating repository. You can use
   gitweb.description repo configuration variable, but the file takes
   precendence.
 * cloneurl (or multiple-valued gitweb.url)
   File with repository URL (used for clone and fetch), one per line.
   Displayed in the project summary page. You can use multiple-valued
   gitweb.url repository configuration variable for that, but the file
   takes precendence.
 * gitweb.owner
   You can use the gitweb.owner repository configuration variable to set
   repository's owner. It is displayed in the project list and summary
   page. If it's not set, filesystem directory's owner is used.
 * various gitweb.* config variables (in config)
   Read description of %feature hash for detailed list, and some
   descriptions.


Webserver configuration
-----------------------

If you want to have one URL for both gitweb and your http://
repositories, you can configure apache like this:

<VirtualHost www:80>
    ServerName git.domain.org
    DocumentRoot /pub/git
    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteRule ^/(.*\.git/(?!/?(info|objects|refs)).*)?$ /cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi%{REQUEST_URI}  [L,PT]
    SetEnv	GITWEB_CONFIG	/etc/gitweb.conf
</VirtualHost>

The above configuration expects your public repositories to live under
/pub/git and will serve them as http://git.domain.org/dir-under-pub-git,
both as cloneable GIT URL and as browseable gitweb interface.
If you then start your git-daemon with --base-path=/pub/git --export-all
then you can even use the git:// URL with exactly the same path.

Setting the environment variable GITWEB_CONFIG will tell gitweb to use
the named file (i.e. in this example /etc/gitweb.conf) as a
configuration for gitweb.  Perl variables defined in here will
override the defaults given at the head of the gitweb.perl (or
gitweb.cgi).  Look at the comments in that file for information on
which variables and what they mean.
