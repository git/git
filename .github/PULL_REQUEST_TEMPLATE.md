Thanks for taking the time to contribute to Git! Please be advised that the
Git community does not use github.com for their contributions. Instead, we use
a mailing list (git@vger.kernel.org) for code submissions, code reviews, and
bug reports. Nevertheless, you can use GitGitGadget (https://gitgitgadget.github.io/)
to conveniently send your Pull Requests commits to our mailing list.

For a single-commit pull request, please *leave the pull request description
empty*: your commit message itself should describe your changes.

Please read the "guidelines for contributing" linked above!
