# This workflow will build and push an application to a Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster when you push your code
#
# This workflow assumes you have already created the target AKS cluster and have created an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
# The ACR should be attached to the AKS cluster
# For instructions see:
#   - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/kubernetes-walkthrough-portal
#   - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-get-started-portal
#   - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/cluster-container-registry-integration?tabs=azure-cli#configure-acr-integration-for-existing-aks-clusters
#   - https://github.com/Azure/aks-create-action
#
# To configure this workflow:
#
# 1. Set the following secrets in your repository (instructions for getting these can be found at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/github/connect-from-azure?tabs=azure-cli%2Clinux):
#    - AZURE_CLIENT_ID
#    - AZURE_TENANT_ID
#    - AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID
#
# 2. Set the following environment variables (or replace the values below):
#    - AZURE_CONTAINER_REGISTRY (name of your container registry / ACR)
#    - RESOURCE_GROUP (where your cluster is deployed)
#    - CLUSTER_NAME (name of your AKS cluster)
#    - CONTAINER_NAME (name of the container image you would like to push up to your ACR)
#    - IMAGE_PULL_SECRET_NAME (name of the ImagePullSecret that will be created to pull your ACR image)
#    - DEPLOYMENT_MANIFEST_PATH (path to the manifest yaml for your deployment)
