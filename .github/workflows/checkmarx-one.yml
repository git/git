# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.

# The Checkmarx One GitHub Action enables you to trigger SAST, SCA, and KICS scans directly from the GitHub workflow.
# It provides a wrapper around the Checkmarx One CLI Tool which creates a zip archive from your source code repository
# and uploads it to Checkmarx One for scanning. The Github Action provides easy integration with GitHub while enabling
# scan customization using the full functionality and flexibility of the CLI tool.

# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Using Checkmarx One Action,
# documentation can be found here : https://checkmarx.com/resource/documents/en/34965-68702-checkmarx-one-github-actions.html
