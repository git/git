/**
 * This header centralizes the declaration of our libcurl dependencies
 * to make it easy to discover the oldest versions we support, and to
 * inform decisions about removing support for older libcurl in the
 * future.
 *
 * The oldest supported version of curl is documented in the "INSTALL"
 * document.
 *
 * The source of truth for what versions have which symbols is
 * https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/docs/libcurl/symbols-in-versions;
 * the release dates are taken from curl.git (at
 * https://github.com/curl/curl/).
 *
 * For each X symbol we need from curl we define our own
 * GIT_CURL_HAVE_X. If multiple similar symbols with the same prefix
 * were defined in the same version we pick one and check for that name.
 *
 * We may also define a missing CURL_* symbol to its known value, if
 * doing so is sufficient to add support for it to older versions that
 * don't have it.
 *
 * Keep any symbols in date order of when their support was
 * introduced, oldest first, in the official version of cURL library.
