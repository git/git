 * Merge notes from o->remote_ref into o->local_ref
 *
 * The given notes_tree 'local_tree' must be the notes_tree referenced by the
 * o->local_ref. This is the notes_tree in which the object-level merge is
 * performed.
 *
 * The commits given by the two refs are merged, producing one of the following
 * outcomes:
 *
 * 1. The merge trivially results in an existing commit (e.g. fast-forward or
 *    already-up-to-date). 'local_tree' is untouched, the OID of the result
 *    is written into 'result_oid' and 0 is returned.
 * 2. The merge successfully completes, producing a merge commit. local_tree
 *    contains the updated notes tree, the OID of the resulting commit is
 *    written into 'result_oid', and 1 is returned.
 * 3. The merge results in conflicts. This is similar to #2 in that the
 *    partial merge result (i.e. merge result minus the unmerged entries)
 *    are stored in 'local_tree', and the OID or the resulting commit
 *    (to be amended when the conflicts have been resolved) is written into
 *    'result_oid'. The unmerged entries are written into the
 *    .git/NOTES_MERGE_WORKTREE directory with conflict markers.
 *    -1 is returned.
 *
 * Both o->local_ref and o->remote_ref must be given (non-NULL), but either ref
 * (although not both) may refer to a non-existing notes ref, in which case
 * that notes ref is interpreted as an empty notes tree, and the merge
 * trivially results in what the other ref points to.
