What's in git.git (Sep 2008, #04; Mon, 29)

  maint edb7e82 (Merge branch 'bc/maint-diff-hunk-header-fix' into maint)
 master 9800c0d (Merge branch 'bc/master-diff-hunk-header-fix')
------------------------------------------------------------------------

With Junio offline for another week we won't see a 1.6.0.3 until
probably mid-October.  With that in mind I've merged a number of
topics and trivial patches to maint so we can shake these out
before the 1.6.0.3 release.

* The 'maint' branch has these fixes since the last announcement.

Alex Riesen (3):
  Remove empty directories in recursive merge
  Add remove_path: a function to remove as much as possible of a path
  Use remove_path from dir.c instead of own implementation

Brandon Casey (5):
  diff.c: return pattern entry pointer rather than just the hunk header
    pattern
  diff.c: associate a flag with each pattern and use it for compiling regex
  diff.*.xfuncname which uses "extended" regex's for hunk header selection
  t4018-diff-funcname: test syntax of builtin xfuncname patterns
  git-stash.sh: don't default to refs/stash if invalid ref supplied
