What's cooking in git.git (Jun 2008, issue #02; Mon, 23)
--------------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed
with '-' are only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are
in 'next'.

The topics list the commits in reverse chronological order.

It already is beginning to become clear what 1.6.0 will look like.  What's
already in 'next' all are well intentioned (I do not guarantee they are
already bug-free --- that is what cooking them in 'next' is for) and are
good set of feature enhancements.  But bigger changes will be:

 * MinGW will be in.

 * /usr/bin/git-cat-file is no more.  The bulk of the git commands will
   move to /usr/libexec/git-core/ or somesuch.

 * git-merge will be rewritten in C.

Currently tip of 'pu' is broken and does not pass tests, as j6t/mingw has
interaction with dr/ceiling and jc/merge-theirs has interaction with
mv/merge-in-c.

* jk/renamelimit (Sat May 3 13:58:42 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 - diff: enable "too large a rename" warning when -M/-C is explicitly
   asked for

This would be the right thing to do for command line use, but gitk will be
hit due to tcl/tk's limitation, so I am holding this back for now.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Stalled/Needs more work]

* jc/reflog-expire (Sun Jun 15 23:48:46 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 - Per-ref reflog expiry configuration

Perhaps a good foundation for optionally unexpirable stash.  As 1.6.0 will
be a good time to make backward incompatible changes, we might make expiry
period of stash 'never' in new repositories.  Needs a concensus.

* jc/merge-theirs (Fri Jun 20 00:17:59 2008 -0700) 2 commits
 - git-merge-recursive-{ours,theirs}
 - git-merge-file --ours, --theirs

Punting a merge by discarding your own work in conflicting parts but still
salvaging the parts that are cleanly automerged.  It is likely that this
will result in nonsense mishmash, but somehow often people want this, so
here they are.  The interface to the backends may need to change, though.

* jc/blame (Wed Jun 4 22:58:40 2008 -0700) 7 commits
 - blame: show "previous" information in --porcelain/--incremental
   format
 - git-blame: refactor code to emit "porcelain format" output
 + git-blame --reverse
 + builtin-blame.c: allow more than 16 parents
 + builtin-blame.c: move prepare_final() into a separate function.
 + rev-list --children
 + revision traversal: --children option

The blame that finds where each line in the original lines moved to.  This
may help a GSoC project that wants to gather statistical overview of the
history.  The final presentation may need tweaking (see the log message of
the commit ""git-blame --reverse" on the series).

The tip two commits are for peeling to see what's behind the blamed
commit, which we should be able to separate out into an independent topic
from the rest.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Dropped for now]

* sj/merge (Sat May 3 16:55:47 2008 -0700) 6 commits
 . Introduce fast forward option only
 . Head reduction before selecting merge strategy
 . Restructure git-merge.sh
 . Introduce -ff=<fast forward option>
 . New merge tests
 . Documentation for joining more than two histories

This will interfere with Miklos's rewrite of merge to C.

* js/rebase-i-sequencer (Sun Apr 27 02:55:50 2008 -0400) 17 commits
 . Use perl instead of tac
 . Fix t3404 assumption that `wc -l` does not use whitespace.
 . rebase -i: Use : in expr command instead of match.
 . rebase -i: update the implementation of 'mark' command
 . Add option --preserve-tags
 . Teach rebase interactive the tag command
 . Add option --first-parent
 . Do rebase with preserve merges with advanced TODO list
 . Select all lines with fake-editor
 . Unify the length of $SHORT* and the commits in the TODO list
 . Teach rebase interactive the merge command
 . Move redo merge code in a function
 . Teach rebase interactive the reset command
 . Teach rebase interactive the mark command
 . Move cleanup code into it's own function
 . Don't append default merge message to -m message
 . fake-editor: output TODO list if unchanged

* jc/cherry-pick (Wed Feb 20 23:17:06 2008 -0800) 3 commits
 . WIP: rethink replay merge
 . Start using replay-tree merge in cherry-pick
 . revert/cherry-pick: start refactoring call to merge_recursive

This is meant to improve cherry-pick's behaviour when renames are
involved, by not using merge-recursive (whose d/f conflict resolution is
quite broken), but unfortunately has stalled for some time now.

* jc/stripspace (Sun Mar 9 00:30:35 2008 -0800) 6 commits
 . git-am --forge: add Signed-off-by: line for the author
 . git-am: clean-up Signed-off-by: lines
 . stripspace: add --log-clean option to clean up signed-off-by:
   lines
 . stripspace: use parse_options()
 . Add "git am -s" test
 . git-am: refactor code to add signed-off-by line for the committer

Just my toy at this moment.

* jc/send-pack-tell-me-more (Thu Mar 20 00:44:11 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 . "git push": tellme-more protocol extension
