What's cooking in git.git (Jul 2008, issue #01; Tue, 01)
--------------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed
with '-' are only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are
in 'next'.

The topics list the commits in reverse chronological order.  The topics
meant to be applied to the maintenance series have "maint-" in their
names.

It already is beginning to become clear what 1.6.0 will look like.  Wha=
t's
already in 'next' all are well intentioned (I do not guarantee they are
already bug-free --- that is what cooking them in 'next' is for) and ar=
e
good set of feature enhancements.  Bigger changes will be:

 * MinGW will be in.

 * With the default Makefile settings, most of the programs will be
   installed outside your $PATH, except for "git", "gitk", "git-gui" an=
d
   some server side programs that need to be accessible for technical
   reasons.  Invoking a git subcommand as "git-xyzzy" from the command
   line has been deprecated since early 2006 (and officially announced =
in
   1.5.4 release notes); use of them from your scripts after adding
   output from "git --exec-path" to the $PATH will still be supported i=
n
   1.6.0, but users are again strongly encouraged to adjust their
   scripts to use "git xyzzy" form, as we will stop installing
   "git-xyzzy" hardlinks for built-in commands in later releases.

 * git-merge will be rewritten in C.

 * default pack and idx versions will be updated as scheduled for some
   time ago.

 * GIT_CONFIG, which was only documented as affecting "git config", but
   actually affected all git commands, now only affects "git config".
   GIT_LOCAL_CONFIG, also only documented as affecting "git config" and
   not different from GIT_CONFIG in a useful way, is removed.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

No explanation necessary ;-)

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Actively Cooking]

* jc/reflog-expire (Sat Jun 28 22:24:49 2008 -0700) 2 commits
 - Make default expiration period of reflog used for stash infinite
 - Per-ref reflog expiry configuration

As 1.6.0 will be a good time to make backward incompatible changes, the
tip commit makes the default expiry period of stash 'never', unless you
configure them to expire explicitly using gc.refs/stash.* variables.
Needs consensus, but I am guessing that enough people would want stash
that does not expire.

We may want to change the commit topology used to represent a stash, as
proposed in $gmane/85055 by Nana earlier.

* jc/merge-theirs (Mon Jun 30 22:18:57 2008 -0700) 4 commits
 - Make "subtree" part more orthogonal to the rest of merge-
   recursive.
 + Teach git-merge to pass -X<option> to the backend strategy module
 + git-merge-recursive-{ours,theirs}
 + git-merge-file --ours, --theirs

Punting a merge by discarding your own work in conflicting parts but st=
ill
salvaging the parts that are cleanly automerged.  It is likely that thi=
s
will result in nonsense mishmash, but somehow often people want this, s=
o
here they are.  The interface to the backends is updated so that you ca=
n
say "git merge -Xours -Xsubtree=3Dfoo/bar/baz -s recursive other" now.

* mv/merge-in-c (Tue Jul 1 04:37:50 2008 +0200) 14 commits
 - Build in merge
 - git-commit-tree: make it usable from other builtins
 - Add new test case to ensure git-merge prepends the custom merge
   message
 - Add new test case to ensure git-merge reduces octopus parents when
   possible
 - Introduce reduce_heads()
 - Introduce get_merge_bases_many()
 - Add new test to ensure git-merge handles more than 25 refs.
 - Introduce get_octopus_merge_bases() in commit.c
 - git-fmt-merge-msg: make it usable from other builtins
 - Move read_cache_unmerged() to read-cache.c
 - Add new test to ensure git-merge handles pull.twohead and
   pull.octopus
 - Move parse-options's skip_prefix() to git-compat-util.h
 - Move commit_list_count() to commit.c
 - Move split_cmdline() to alias.c

I think this is getting there.  Will be in 'next' soon.

* dr/ceiling (Mon May 19 23:49:34 2008 -0700) 4 commits
 + Eliminate an unnecessary chdir("..")
 + Add support for GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES
 + Fold test-absolute-path into test-path-utils
 + Implement normalize_absolute_path

* jc/rerere (Sun Jun 22 02:04:31 2008 -0700) 5 commits
 + rerere.autoupdate
 + t4200: fix rerere test
 + rerere: remove dubious "tail_optimization"
 + git-rerere: detect unparsable conflicts
 + rerere: rerere_created_at() and has_resolution() abstraction

A new configuration will allow paths that have been resolved cleanly by
rerere to be updated in the index automatically.

* ph/parseopt-step-blame (Tue Jun 24 11:12:12 2008 +0200) 7 commits
 - Migrate git-blame to parse-option partially.
 - parse-opt: add PARSE_OPT_KEEP_ARGV0 parser option.
 - parse-opt: fake short strings for callers to believe in.
 - parse-opt: do not print errors on unknown options, return -2
   intead.
 - parse-opt: create parse_options_step.
 - parse-opt: Export a non NORETURN usage dumper.
 - parse-opt: have parse_options_{start,end}.

I recall Pierre said something about cleaning up the last one when he
finds time, but other than that vague recollection, I lost track of thi=
s
series.  I am tempted to fork a few topics off of the pen=C3=BAltimo on=
e to
convert a few more commands as examples and merge the result to 'next'.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* ph/mergetool (Mon Jun 16 17:33:41 2008 -0600) 1 commit
 + Remove the use of '--' in merge program invocation

I got tired of waiting for success reports from people who use various
backends.  We will hear breakages if this breaks things anyway, and if =
it
does, it is a fairly simple single patch to revert.

* nd/dashless (Tue Jun 24 19:58:11 2008 -0700) 2 commits
 + Keep some git-* programs in $(bindir)
 + Move all dashed-form commands to libexecdir

We'll leave server-side programs in $(bindir) so that ssh clients can a=
sk
for "git-program" and find them on the $PATH.  Next major release after
1.6.0 would most likely remove the hardlinks to built-in commands, but =
not
yet.

* jc/dashless (Thu Jun 26 16:43:34 2008 -0700) 2 commits
 + Prepare execv_git_cmd() for removal of builtins from the
   filesystem
 + git-shell: accept "git foo" form

The botched "client asks 'git foo'" is not included.  It will be long
after everybody runs 1.6.0.

* jk/maint-fetch-ref-hier (Fri Jun 27 00:01:41 2008 -0400) 2 commits
 + fetch: give a hint to the user when local refs fail to update
 + fetch: report local storage errors in status table

When the remote used to have "foo" branch but now has "foo/bar", fetch
refuses to delete the existing remote tracking branch "foo" to create a
new remote tracking branch "foo/bar", but the error message was
confusing.

Need to backmerge to 'maint' after a while.

* jc/maint-reset (Wed Jun 25 18:16:36 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 + Allow "git-reset path" when unambiguous

We used to require "git-reset -- path" even when there is no ambiguity
(i.e. path cannot be mistaken as a valid tree-ish and it is a filename =
in
the work tree).

Need to backmerge to 'maint' after a while.

* js/maint-clone-insteadof (Fri Jun 27 13:55:23 2008 +0100) 2 commits
 + clone: respect the settings in $HOME/.gitconfig and /etc/gitconfig
 + clone: respect url.insteadOf setting in global configs

"git clone" did not honor "url.InsteadOf" in $HOME/.gitconfig.  I think
Daniel's "Let's get rid of internal use of GIT_CONFIG" makes sense (eve=
n
though it feels very scary), and it would make the solution much simple=
r,
but these two are independently good fix for now.  I'll queue GIT_CONFI=
G
one in 'next' and when it graduates the unsetenv() solution in these wi=
ll
become no-op.

* tr/send-email-ssl (Thu Jun 26 23:03:21 2008 +0200) 2 commits
 + git-send-email: prevent undefined variable warnings if no
   encryption is set
 + git-send-email: add support for TLS via Net::SMTP::SSL

* kb/send-email-fifo (Wed Jun 25 15:44:40 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 + git-send-email: Accept fifos as well as files

Two minor send-email feature enhancements.

* jc/checkdiff (Sun Jun 29 16:49:06 2008 -0400) 7 commits
 + Fix t4017-diff-retval for white-space from wc
 + Update sample pre-commit hook to use "diff --check"
 + diff --check: detect leftover conflict markers
 + Teach "diff --check" about new blank lines at end
 + checkdiff: pass diff_options to the callback
 + check_and_emit_line(): rename and refactor
 + diff --check: explain why we do not care whether old side is
   binary

Allows us to replace the sample pre-commit hook that was not aware of t=
he
line termination convention per path nor newer whitespace breakage rule=
s.

* np/pack-default (Wed Jun 25 00:25:53 2008 -0400) 2 commits
 + pack.indexversion config option now defaults to 2
 + repack.usedeltabaseoffset config option now defaults to "true"

Updates the default value for pack.indexversion to 2 and use delta-base
offset encoding of the packfiles by default.

* js/apply-recount (Fri Jun 27 18:43:09 2008 +0100) 1 commit
 + Allow git-apply to recount the lines in a hunk (AKA recountdiff)

A good ingredient for implementing "apply --edit".

* dz/apply-again (Fri Jun 27 14:39:12 2008 -0400) 1 commit
 + git-apply: handle a patch that touches the same path more than
   once better

Allows us to feed a patch that touches the same path more than once.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[On Hold]

* sg/merge-options (Sun Apr 6 03:23:47 2008 +0200) 1 commit
 + merge: remove deprecated summary and diffstat options and config
   variables

This was previously in "will be in master soon" category, but it turns =
out
that the synonyms to the ones this one deletes are fairly new invention
that happend in 1.5.6 timeframe, and we cannot do this just yet.

* jc/dashless (Thu Jun 26 16:43:34 2008 -0700) 2 commits
 + Revert "Make clients ask for "git program" over ssh and local
   transport"
 + Make clients ask for "git program" over ssh and local transport

This is the "botched" one.  Will be resurrected during 1.7.0 or 1.8.0
timeframe.

* jk/renamelimit (Sat May 3 13:58:42 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 - diff: enable "too large a rename" warning when -M/-C is explicitly
   asked for

This would be the right thing to do for command line use, but gitk will=
 be
hit due to tcl/tk's limitation, so I am holding this back for now.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Stalled/Needs more work]

* jc/blame (Wed Jun 4 22:58:40 2008 -0700) 7 commits
 - blame: show "previous" information in --porcelain/--incremental
   format
 - git-blame: refactor code to emit "porcelain format" output
 + git-blame --reverse
 + builtin-blame.c: allow more than 16 parents
 + builtin-blame.c: move prepare_final() into a separate function.
 + rev-list --children
 + revision traversal: --children option

The blame that finds where each line in the original lines moved to.  T=
his
may help a GSoC project that wants to gather statistical overview of th=
e
history.  The final presentation may need tweaking (see the log message=
 of
the commit ""git-blame --reverse" on the series).

The tip two commits are for peeling to see what's behind the blamed
commit, which we should be able to separate out into an independent top=
ic
from the rest.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Dropped for now]

* sj/merge (Sat May 3 16:55:47 2008 -0700) 6 commits
 . Introduce fast forward option only
 . Head reduction before selecting merge strategy
 . Restructure git-merge.sh
 . Introduce -ff=3D<fast forward option>
 . New merge tests
 . Documentation for joining more than two histories

This will interfere with Miklos's rewrite of merge to C.

 . Use perl instead of tac
 . Fix t3404 assumption that `wc -l` does not use whitespace.
 . rebase -i: Use : in expr command instead of match.
 . rebase -i: update the implementation of 'mark' command
 . Add option --preserve-tags
 . Teach rebase interactive the tag command
 . Add option --first-parent
 . Do rebase with preserve merges with advanced TODO list
 . Select all lines with fake-editor
 . Unify the length of $SHORT* and the commits in the TODO list
 . Teach rebase interactive the merge command
 . Move redo merge code in a function

 . WIP: rethink replay merge
 . Start using replay-tree merge in cherry-pick
 . revert/cherry-pick: start refactoring call to merge_recursive

This is meant to improve cherry-pick's behaviour when renames are
involved, by not using merge-recursive (whose d/f conflict resolution i=
s
quite broken), but unfortunately has stalled for some time now.

* jc/stripspace (Sun Mar 9 00:30:35 2008 -0800) 6 commits
 . git-am --forge: add Signed-off-by: line for the author
 . git-am: clean-up Signed-off-by: lines
 . stripspace: add --log-clean option to clean up signed-off-by:
   lines
 . stripspace: use parse_options()
 . Add "git am -s" test
 . git-am: refactor code to add signed-off-by line for the committer

Just my toy at this moment.

* jc/send-pack-tell-me-more (Thu Mar 20 00:44:11 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 . "git push": tellme-more protocol extension
