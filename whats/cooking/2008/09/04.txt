What's cooking in git.git (Sep 2008, #04; Mon, 22)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed
with '-' are only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are
in 'next'.

The topics list the commits in reverse chronological order.  The topics
meant to be merged to the maintenance series have "maint-" in their names.

I'll be on vacation til Oct 08; proposal/review/discussion/improvement
cycle based on e-mails and the distributed nature of git mean that it
shouldn't keep the participants from further improving the system.  I've
asked Shawn to look after in-flight patches during the time, so hopefully
when I come back I'll see a much better git ;-).

----------------------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* nd/narrow (Sun Sep 14 20:07:59 2008 +0700) 9 commits
 - grep: skip files that have not been checked out
 - checkout_entry(): CE_NO_CHECKOUT on checked out entries.
 - Prevent diff machinery from examining worktree outside narrow
   checkout
 - Add tests for updating no-checkout entries in index
 - ls-files: add --narrow-checkout option to "will checkout" entries
 - update-index: add --checkout/--no-checkout to update
   CE_NO_CHECKOUT bit
 - update-index: refactor mark_valid() in preparation for new options
 - Introduce CE_NO_CHECKOUT bit
 - Extend index to save more flags

This is an early half of the earlier series (I haven't had chance to look
at the updated series yet), and should be replaced with the updated one
posted recently.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Stalled -- Needs Action to Proceed (or to be dropped)]

* pb/submodule (Fri Sep 12 23:09:19 2008 +0200) 1 commit
 - t7400: Add short "git submodule add" testsuite

Waiting for a reroll.

* bd/blame (Thu Aug 21 18:22:01 2008 -0500) 5 commits
 - Use xdiff caching to improve git blame performance
 - Allow xdiff machinery to cache hash results for a file
 - Always initialize xpparam_t to 0
 - Bypass textual patch generation and parsing in git blame
 - Allow alternate "low-level" emit function from xdl_diff

Réne had good comments on how the callback should be structured.

* kb/am-directory (Fri Aug 29 15:27:50 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 - git-am: Pass the --directory option through to git-apply

I think this is still buggy and drops the option when am stops with
conflicts.

----------------------------------------------------------------

(Tip at 92bb978)

(Tip at 96d1a8e)

The above two are ready for 'maint'.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Actively Cooking]

* tr/workflow-doc (Sat Sep 13 18:11:01 2008 +0200) 2 commits
 + Documentation: Refer to git-rebase(1) to warn against rewriting
 + Documentation: new upstream rebase recovery section in git-rebase

My impression from the last round of discusson on the third patch in this
series (not queued here) was that as long as we do not present it as "One
True Workflow", the description was a good starting point, possibly others
to add other recommended flows later.

* pb/commit-where (Mon Sep 8 01:05:41 2008 +0200) 1 commit
 + builtin-commit.c: show on which branch a commit was added

Tentatively kicked back to "still cooking" status after Jeff voiced his
annoyance.  I personally do not like making this multi-line as Jeff
suggested as an alternative (the message already is too verbose to my
taste).

* lt/time-reject-fractional-seconds (Sat Aug 16 21:25:40 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 + date/time: do not get confused by fractional seconds

* jc/add-ita (Thu Aug 21 01:44:53 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 + git-add --intent-to-add (-N)

Teaches "git add" to record only the intent to add a path later.
I rerolled this without the fake empty blob object.

* jc/post-simplify (Fri Aug 15 01:34:51 2008 -0700) 2 commits
 - revision --simplify-merges: incremental simplification
 - revision --simplify-merges: prepare for incremental simplification

I started making this incremental but the progress is not so great.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[On Hold]

* jc/stripspace (Sun Mar 9 00:30:35 2008 -0800) 6 commits
 - git-am --forge: add Signed-off-by: line for the author
 - git-am: clean-up Signed-off-by: lines
 - stripspace: add --log-clean option to clean up signed-off-by:
   lines
 - stripspace: use parse_options()
 - Add "git am -s" test
 - git-am: refactor code to add signed-off-by line for the committer

The one at second from the tip needs reworking.

* jc/send-pack-tell-me-more (Thu Mar 20 00:44:11 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 - "git push": tellme-more protocol extension

* jc/merge-whitespace (Sun Feb 24 23:29:36 2008 -0800) 1 commit
 - WIP: start teaching the --whitespace=fix to merge machinery

* jc/blame (Wed Jun 4 22:58:40 2008 -0700) 2 commits
 - blame: show "previous" information in --porcelain/--incremental
   format
 - git-blame: refactor code to emit "porcelain format" output

* sg/merge-options (Sun Apr 6 03:23:47 2008 +0200) 1 commit
 + merge: remove deprecated summary and diffstat options and config
   variables

This was previously in "will be in master soon" category, but it turns out
that the synonyms to the ones this one deletes are fairly new invention
that happend in 1.5.6 timeframe, and we cannot do this just yet.  Perhaps
in 1.7.0, but with the loud whining about moving git-foo out of $PATH we
have been hearing, it might not be a bad idea to drop this.

* jk/renamelimit (Sat May 3 13:58:42 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 - diff: enable "too large a rename" warning when -M/-C is explicitly
   asked for

This would be the right thing to do for command line use, but gitk will be
hit due to tcl/tk's limitation, so I am holding this back for now.
