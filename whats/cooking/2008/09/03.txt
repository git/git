What's cooking in git.git (Sep 2008, #03; Fri, 19)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed
with '-' are only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are
in 'next'.

The topics list the commits in reverse chronological order.  The topics
meant to be merged to the maintenance series have "maint-" in their names.

By the way, I'll be on vacation from Sep 24 til Oct 08, but e-mail based
proposal/review/discussion/improvement cycle and the distributed nature of
git mean that it shouldn't keep the participants from further working on
the system.  Hopefully when I come back I'll see a much improved git ;-).

----------------------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* mg/maint-remote-fix (Thu Sep 18 18:11:02 2008 +0200) 1 commit
 - make "git remote" report multiple URLs

Still with a minor nit but I think this is an improvement.

* pb/submodule (Fri Sep 12 23:09:19 2008 +0200) 1 commit
 - t7400: Add short "git submodule add" testsuite

Waiting for a reroll.

* tr/workflow-doc (Sat Sep 13 18:11:01 2008 +0200) 2 commits
 + Documentation: Refer to git-rebase(1) to warn against rewriting
 + Documentation: new upstream rebase recovery section in git-rebase

I think the last one on "recommended practice" needs discussion.  I do not
think it describes _the_ recommended workflow, although I think (1) what
is recommended in the draft does make sense within its own scope, and (2)
it may be impossible to come up with _the_ recommended workflow anyway.

* bc/maint-diff-hunk-header-fix (Thu Sep 18 17:44:33 2008 -0500) 3 commits
 + diff.*.xfuncname which uses "extended" regex's for hunk header
   selection
 + diff.c: associate a flag with each pattern and use it for
   compiling regex
 + diff.c: return pattern entry pointer rather than just the hunk
   header pattern

* bc/master-diff-hunk-header-fix (Thu Sep 18 20:32:50 2008 -0700) 4 commits
 + Merge branch 'bc/maint-diff-hunk-header-fix' into bc/master-diff-
   hunk-header-fix
 + diff.*.xfuncname which uses "extended" regex's for hunk header
   selection
 + diff.c: associate a flag with each pattern and use it for
   compiling regex
 + diff.c: return pattern entry pointer rather than just the hunk
   header pattern

I've commented on these two branches in a separate message.

----------------------------------------------------------------

 + move load_ref_decorations() to log-tree.c and export it
 + log: add load_ref_decorations()

* tr/rev-list-reverse (Mon Sep 1 00:31:37 2008 +0200) 2 commits

 + rev-list: fix --reverse interaction with --parents

* jc/diff-prefix (Mon Aug 18 20:08:09 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 + diff: vary default prefix depending on what are compared

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Stalled -- Needs Action to Proceed (or to be dropped)]

* bd/blame (Thu Aug 21 18:22:01 2008 -0500) 5 commits
 - Use xdiff caching to improve git blame performance
 - Allow xdiff machinery to cache hash results for a file
 - Always initialize xpparam_t to 0
 - Bypass textual patch generation and parsing in git blame
 - Allow alternate "low-level" emit function from xdl_diff

Réne had good comments on how the callback should be structured.

* kb/am-directory (Fri Aug 29 15:27:50 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 - git-am: Pass the --directory option through to git-apply

I think this is still buggy and drops the option when am stops with
conflicts.

----------------------------------------------------------------

   less
 + xmerge.c: minimum readability fixups
 + xdiff-merge: optionally show conflicts in "diff3 -m" style
 + xdl_fill_merge_buffer(): separate out a too deeply nested function
 + checkout --ours/--theirs: allow checking out one side of a
   conflicting merge
 + checkout -f: allow ignoring unmerged paths when checking out of

* jc/add-ita (Thu Aug 21 01:44:53 2008 -0700) 1 commit

Teaches "git add" to record only the intent to add a path later.
I rerolled this without the fake empty blob object.

* jc/post-simplify (Fri Aug 15 01:34:51 2008 -0700) 2 commits
 - revision --simplify-merges: incremental simplification
 - revision --simplify-merges: prepare for incremental simplification

I started making this incremental but the progress is not so great.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[On Hold]

* jc/stripspace (Sun Mar 9 00:30:35 2008 -0800) 6 commits
 - git-am --forge: add Signed-off-by: line for the author
 - git-am: clean-up Signed-off-by: lines
 - stripspace: add --log-clean option to clean up signed-off-by:
   lines
 - stripspace: use parse_options()
 - Add "git am -s" test
 - git-am: refactor code to add signed-off-by line for the committer

The one at second from the tip needs reworking.

* jc/send-pack-tell-me-more (Thu Mar 20 00:44:11 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 - "git push": tellme-more protocol extension

* jc/merge-whitespace (Sun Feb 24 23:29:36 2008 -0800) 1 commit
 - WIP: start teaching the --whitespace=fix to merge machinery

* jc/blame (Wed Jun 4 22:58:40 2008 -0700) 2 commits
 - blame: show "previous" information in --porcelain/--incremental
   format
 - git-blame: refactor code to emit "porcelain format" output

* sg/merge-options (Sun Apr 6 03:23:47 2008 +0200) 1 commit
 + merge: remove deprecated summary and diffstat options and config
   variables

This was previously in "will be in master soon" category, but it turns out
that the synonyms to the ones this one deletes are fairly new invention
that happend in 1.5.6 timeframe, and we cannot do this just yet.  Perhaps
in 1.7.0, but with the loud whining about moving git-foo out of $PATH we
have been hearing, it might not be a bad idea to drop this.

* jk/renamelimit (Sat May 3 13:58:42 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 - diff: enable "too large a rename" warning when -M/-C is explicitly
   asked for

This would be the right thing to do for command line use, but gitk will be
hit due to tcl/tk's limitation, so I am holding this back for now.
