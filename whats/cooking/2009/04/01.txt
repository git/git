What's cooking in git.git (Apr 2009, #01; Mon, 06)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones
marked with '.' do not appear in any of the branches, but I am still
holding onto them.

The topics list the commits in reverse chronological order.  The topics
meant to be merged to the maintenance series have "maint-" in their names.

----------------------------------------------------------------

by running some benchmarks.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Stalled and may need help and prodding to go forward]

* ps/blame (Thu Mar 12 21:30:03 2009 +1100) 1 commit
 - blame.c: start libifying the blame infrastructure

A few minor point remains in this initial one.  I hate to do these minor
fix-ups myself, but I may end up doing so...

* jc/log-tz (Tue Mar 3 00:45:37 2009 -0800) 1 commit
 - Allow --date=local --date=other-format to work as expected

The one I posted had a few corner-case bugs that was caught with the test
suite; this one has them fixed.  People did not like the UI so it is kept
out of 'next'

* lh/submodule-tree-traversal (Sun Jan 25 01:52:06 2009 +0100) 1 commit
 - archive.c: add support for --submodules[=(all|checkedout)]

Discussion stalled on the submodule selection criteria.
Probably I should discard it and wait for a reroll if needed.

* jc/merge-convert (Mon Jan 26 16:45:01 2009 -0800) 1 commit
 - git-merge-file: allow converting the results for the work tree

This is a feature waiting for a user.

We did not give scripted Porcelains a way to say "this temporary file I am
using for merging is for this path, so use the core.autocrlf and attributes
rules for that final path".  Instead, merge-file simply wrote out the
data in the canonical repository representation.

rerere has the same issue, but it is a lot worse.  It reads the three
files (preimage, postimage and thisimage) from the work tree in the work
tree representation, merges them without converting them to the canonical
representation first but inserts the conflict markers with the canonical
representation and writes the resulting mess out.  It needs to be fixed to
read with convert_to_git(), merge them while they are still in the
canonical representation and possibly add conflict markers, and then write
the results out after convert_to_working_tree().  It also needs to write
in binary mode as well.

* db/foreign-scm (Sun Jan 11 15:12:10 2009 -0500) 3 commits
 - Support fetching from foreign VCSes
 - Add specification of git-vcs helpers

 - git-notes: fix printing of multi-line notes
 - notes: fix core.notesRef documentation

* hv/cvsps-tests (Sun Apr 5 01:40:50 2009 -0700) 8 commits
 - t/t9600: remove exit after test_done
 - cvsimport: extend testcase about patchset order to contain
   branches
 - cvsimport: add test illustrating a bug in cvsps
 + Add a test of "git cvsimport"'s handling of tags and branches
 + Add some tests of git-cvsimport's handling of vendor branches
 + Test contents of entire cvsimported "master" tree contents
 + Use CVS's -f option if available (ignore user's ~/.cvsrc file)
 + Start a library for cvsimport-related tests

Two cvsimport test topics were rewound from 'next' and merged into this
one.  I'll keep this in 'pu' so that people can polish their cvsps skilz
to resolve issues these tests identify.

[On Hold]

* jc/deny-delete-current-1.7.0 (Mon Feb 9 00:19:46 2009 -0800) 1 commit
 - receive-pack: default receive.denyDeleteCurrent to refuse

These are for 1.7.0, but the messages when they trigger together may need
to be rethought.
