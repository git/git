What's cooking in git.git (Oct 2009, #05; Wed, 28)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones
marked with '.' do not appear in any of the integration branches, but I am
still holding onto them.

In 1.7.0, we plan to correct handful of warts in the interfaces everybody
agrees that they were mistakes.  The resulting system may not be strictly
backward compatible.  Currently planeed changes are:

 * refuse push to update the checked out branch in a non-bare repo by
   default

   Make "git push" into a repository to update the branch that is checked
   out fail by default.  You can countermand this default by setting a
   configuration variable in the receiving repository.

   http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/107758/focus=108007

 * refuse push to delete the current branch by default

   Make "git push $there :$killed" to delete the branch that is pointed at
   by its HEAD fail by default.  You can countermand this default by
   setting a configuration variable in the receiving repository.

   http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/108862/focus=108936

 * git-send-email won't make deep threads by default

   Many people said that by default when sending more than 2 patches the
   threading git-send-email makes by default is hard to read, and they
   prefer the default be one cover letter and each patch as a direct
   follow-up to the cover letter.  You can countermand this by setting a
   configuration variable.

   http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/109790

 * git-status won't be "git-commit --dry-run" anymore

   http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/125989/focus=125993

 * "git-diff -w --exit-code" will exit success if only differences it
   found are whitespace changes that are stripped away from the output.

 - t4034-diff-words: add a test for word diff without context

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* tr/filter-branch (2009-10-21) 2 commits.
 - filter-branch: nearest-ancestor rewriting outside subdir filter
 - filter-branch: stop special-casing $filter_subdir argument

J6t already has some comments on this.

* mr/gitweb-snapshot (2009-09-26) 2 commits.
 - gitweb: append short hash ids to snapshot files
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-10-11 at 22ba047)
 + gitweb: check given hash before trying to create snapshot

Jakub says the tip one needs updates.

* ne/rev-cache (2009-10-19) 7 commits.
 - support for commit grafts, slight change to general mechanism
 - support for path name caching in rev-cache
 - full integration of rev-cache into git, completed test suite
 - administrative functions for rev-cache, start of integration into git
 - support for non-commit object caching in rev-cache
 - basic revision cache system, no integration or features

The author indicated that there is another round coming.

* jl/submodule-add-noname (2009-09-22) 1 commit.
 - git submodule add: make the <path> parameter optional

Dscho started an interesting discussion regarding the larger workflow in
which the "submodule add" is used.  I think the patch itself makes sense
but at the same time it probably makes sense to also take the <path> and
infer the <repository> as Dscho suggested, probably in "git submodule
add", not in "git add" proper, at least initially.

* sr/gfi-options (2009-09-06) 6 commits.
 - fast-import: test the new option command
 - fast-import: add option command
 - fast-import: test the new feature command
 - fast-import: add feature command
 - fast-import: put marks reading in it's own function
 - fast-import: put option parsing code in separate functions

???

* je/send-email-no-subject (2009-08-05) 1 commit.
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-10-11 at 1b99c56)
 + send-email: confirm on empty mail subjects

The existing tests cover the positive case (i.e. as long as the user says
"yes" to the "do you really want to send this message that lacks subject",
the message is sent) of this feature, but the feature itself needs its own
test to verify the negative case (i.e. does it correctly stop if the user
says "no"?)

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* db/vcs-helper-rest (2009-10-27) 7 commits.
 - Fix memory leak in helper method for disconnect
 - Allow helpers to report in "list" command that the ref is unchanged
 - Add support for "import" helper command
 - Add a config option for remotes to specify a foreign vcs
 - Allow programs to not depend on remotes having urls
 - Allow fetch to modify refs
 - Use a function to determine whether a remote is valid
 (this branch is used by jh/cvs-helper.)

Queued a fix-up.

* jh/cvs-helper (2009-08-18) 8 commits.
 - More fixes to the git-remote-cvs installation procedure
 - Fix the Makefile-generated path to the git_remote_cvs package in git-remote-cvs

 - git-remote-cvs: Remote helper program for CVS repositories
 - 2/2: Add Python support library for CVS remote helper
 - 1/2: Add Python support library for CVS remote helper
 - Basic build infrastructure for Python scripts
 - Allow helpers to request marks for fast-import
 (this branch uses db/vcs-helper-rest.)

This depends on the above.

* cb/doc-fetch-pull-merge (2009-10-21) 1 commit.
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-10-21 at 1d9190d)

Soon in 'master'.

  (merged to 'next' on 2009-10-22 at 14c5631)
 + Quote ' as \(aq in manpages

Soon in 'master'.

* rs/pretty-wrap (2009-10-17) 1 commit
 - Implement wrap format %w() as if it is a mode switch
 (this branch uses js/log-rewrap.)

* jc/pretty-lf (2009-10-04) 1 commit.
 - Pretty-format: %[+-]x to tweak inter-item newlines

 - Teach --wrap to only indent without wrapping
 - Add strbuf_add_wrapped_text() to utf8.[ch]
 - print_wrapped_text(): allow hard newlines
 (this branch is used by rs/pretty-wrap.)

Before discarding jc/strbuf-nested-expand, I cherry-picked the tip of it
to this series.

* sr/blame-incomplete (2009-10-19) 1 commit.
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-10-22 at 133e0ce)
 + blame: make sure that the last line ends in an LF

I think this is _good enough_ as-is; although it would be better if we
added some hint to the output for Porcelain implementations, that can be
done as a follow-up fix.

* ak/bisect-reset-to-switch (2009-10-13) 1 commit.
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-10-22 at 592fff3)

  (merged to 'next' on 2009-10-22 at 90ccac6)
 + info/grafts: allow trailing whitespaces at the end of line

Soon in 'master'.

* jn/show-normalized-refs (2009-10-12) 3 commits.
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-10-23 at 332aad3)
 + check-ref-format: simplify --print implementation

 + Add tests for git check-ref-format

Soon in 'master'.

* jc/checkout-auto-track (2009-10-18) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-10-23 at ff7e8f3)
 + git checkout --no-guess
 + DWIM "git checkout frotz" to "git checkout -b frotz origin/frotz"
 + check_filename(): make verify_filename() callable without dying

The final shape of this series ended up to be more or less exactly what
Dscho hinted he wanted to have in one of the discussion.

Soon in 'master'.

* tr/stash-format (2009-10-19) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-10-23 at 6c551c3)

--------------------------------------------------
[For 1.7.0]

* jc/1.7.0-no-commit-no-ff-2 (2009-10-22) 1 commit.
 - git-merge: forbid fast-forward and up-to-date when --no-commit is given

This makes "git merge --no-commit" fail when it results in fast-forward or
up-to-date.  I haven't described this at the beginning of this message
yet, as it is not clear if this change is even necessary.  Opinions?

* jk/1.7.0-status (2009-09-05) 5 commits.
 - docs: note that status configuration affects only long format
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-10-11 at 65c8513)
 + commit: support alternate status formats
 + status: add --porcelain output format
 + status: refactor format option parsing
 + status: refactor short-mode printing to its own function
 (this branch uses jc/1.7.0-status.)

Gives the --short output format to post 1.7.0 "git commit --dry-run" that
is similar to that of post 1.7.0 "git status".

The tip one is not in 'next' as I have been hoping that somebody may want
to change the code to make it unnecessary, but it does not seem to be
happening, so probably it should also go to 'next'.

* jc/1.7.0-status (2009-09-05) 4 commits.
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-10-11 at 9558627)
 + status: typo fix in usage
 + git status: not "commit --dry-run" anymore
 + git stat -s: short status output
 + git stat: the beginning of "status that is not a dry-run of commit"
 (this branch is used by jk/1.7.0-status.)

With this, "git status" is no longer "git commit --dry-run".

* jc/1.7.0-send-email-no-thread-default (2009-08-22) 1 commit.
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-10-11 at 043acdf)
 + send-email: make --no-chain-reply-to the default

* jc/1.7.0-diff-whitespace-only-status (2009-08-30) 4 commits.
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-10-11 at 546c74d)
 + diff.c: fix typoes in comments
 + Make test case number unique
 + diff: Rename QUIET internal option to QUICK
 + diff: change semantics of "ignore whitespace" options

This changes exit code from "git diff --ignore-whitespace" and friends
when there is no actual output.  It is a backward incompatible change, but
we could argue that it is a bugfix.

* jc/1.7.0-push-safety (2009-02-09) 2 commits.
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-10-11 at 81b8128)
 + Refuse deleting the current branch via push
 + Refuse updating the current branch in a non-bare repository via push

 - mailinfo: -b option keeps [bracketed] strings that is not a [PATCH] marker

Maybe some people care about this.  I dunno.
