What's cooking in git.git (Mar 2009, #01; Tue, 03)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones
marked with '.' do not appear in any of the branches, but I am still
holding onto them.

The topics list the commits in reverse chronological order.  The topics
meant to be merged to the maintenance series have "maint-" in their names.

The master branch is slightly past 1.6.2-rc2.  It's been a week and I
think I can declare the final on this Wednesday, *if* I am not too mired
by the day job, but I do not know what would happen yet.

As an experiment, 'next' and 'pu' stayed open during this release freeze;
new topics have been accepted.  I have to say that the experiment was a
moderate success, and many topics in 'next' seem to be of fairly high
quality already, which would mean that we will have a shorter cycle before
1.6.3.

 . parse_options(): do not "increment" boolean
 . clone: ignore --depth when cloning locally (implicitly --local)
 . clone: do not ignore --no-local option

Jeff had a good suggestion for this series but it was tripped by
a misfeature in parse_options().

* rs/memmem (Tue Mar 3 00:19:30 2009 +0100) 2 commits
 - optimize compat/ memmem()
 - diffcore-pickaxe: use memmem()

As always with patches from René, this is already next material.

 - parse-opt: migrate builtin-ls-files.
 - Turn the flags in struct dir_struct into a single variable

   rebase

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Discarded]

 - fsck: three levels of validation
 - verify-pack: add --quick
 - verify_pack(): allow a quicker verification for a pack with
   version 2 idx
 - pack-check.c: minor formatting fix to match coding style

J6t has a good point that if this had any value then medium level should
replace the default.  I am tempted to actually dropping this as a failed
experiment.

* js/remote-set-head (Sat Feb 14 05:30:30 2009 -0500) 5 commits
 - builtin-remote: better handling of multiple remote HEADs
 - builtin-remote: add set-head subcommand
 - builtin-remote: teach show to display remote HEAD
 - builtin-remote: move duplicated cleanup code its own function
 - builtin-clone: move locate_head() to remote.c so it can be re-used

 - remote: use exact HEAD lookup if it is available
 - remote: refactor guess_remote_head
 - refactor find_refs_by_name to accept const list
 - add basic http clone/fetch tests
 - test scripts: refactor start_httpd helper

These two are now consolidated into Jay's remove-improvements series
listed above.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Stalled and may need help and prodding to go forward]

* gb/gitweb-base (Sun Feb 15 10:18:36 2009 +0100) 1 commit
 - gitweb: fix wrong base URL when non-root DirectoryIndex

* ns/stash-keep (Thu Feb 12 06:25:14 2009 +0900) 1 commit
 - stash: --keep option just saves

Do we want to keep this one?

* lh/submodule-tree-traversal (Sun Jan 25 01:52:06 2009 +0100) 1 commit
 - archive.c: add support for --submodules[=(all|checkedout)]

Discussion stalled on the submodule selection criteria.

* jc/blame (Wed Jun 4 22:58:40 2008 -0700) 2 commits
 + blame: show "previous" information in --porcelain/--incremental
   format
 + git-blame: refactor code to emit "porcelain format" output

This gives Porcelains (like gitweb) the information on the commit _before_
the one that the final blame is laid on, which should save them one
rev-parse to dig further.  The line number in the "previous" information
may need refining, and sanity checking code for reference counting may
need to be resurrected before this can move forward.

I thought recent tig discussion may blow new life into it, but is this
unneeded?  If so I'd rather revert it (or discard after 1.6.2).

* db/foreign-scm (Sun Jan 11 15:12:10 2009 -0500) 3 commits
 - Support fetching from foreign VCSes
 - Add specification of git-vcs helpers
 - Add "vcs" config option in remotes

The "spec" did not seem quite well cooked yet, but in the longer term I
think something like this to allow interoperating with other SCMs as if
the other end is a native git repository is a very worthy goal.

* cc/replace (Mon Feb 2 06:13:06 2009 +0100) 11 commits
 - builtin-replace: use "usage_msg_opt" to give better error messages
 - parse-options: add new function "usage_msg_opt"
 - builtin-replace: teach "git replace" to actually replace
 - Add new "git replace" command
 - environment: add global variable to disable replacement
 - mktag: call "check_sha1_signature" with the replacement sha1
 - replace_object: add a test case
 - object: call "check_sha1_signature" with the replacement sha1
 - sha1_file: add a "read_sha1_file_repl" function
 - replace_object: add mechanism to replace objects found in
   "refs/replace/"
 - refs: add a "for_each_replace_ref" function

I think the code is much cleaner than the first round, but I am not
convinced it is doing the right thing in the connectivity traverser.  
Independent review sorely needed.

* sc/gitweb-category (Fri Dec 12 00:45:12 2008 +0100) 3 commits
 - gitweb: Optional grouping of projects by category
 - gitweb: Split git_project_list_body in two functions
 - gitweb: Modularized git_get_project_description to be more generic

Design discussion between Jakub and Sebastien seems to have stalled, but
Jakub seems to be taking this over.

----------------------------------------------------------------

 + git config: trivial cleanup for editor action

Rerolled and looked sane.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[On Hold]

* jc/deny-delete-current-1.7.0 (Mon Feb 9 00:19:46 2009 -0800) 1 commit
 - receive-pack: default receive.denyDeleteCurrent to refuse

* jc/refuse-push-to-current-1.7.0 (Wed Feb 11 02:28:03 2009 -0800) 1 commit
 - Refuse updating the current branch in a non-bare repository via
   push

This is for 1.7.0.

* jc/commit-assume-also-during-merge (Thu Jan 22 22:21:49 2009 -0800) 3 commits
 - git commit: pathspec without -i/-o implies -i semantics during a
   merge
 - builtin-commit: shorten eye-sore overlong lines
 - Add "partial commit" tests during a conflicted merge

This was only meant as a weatherballoon to help facilitate discussion.

* jc/merge-convert (Mon Jan 26 16:45:01 2009 -0800) 1 commit
 - git-merge-file: allow converting the results for the work tree

This is a feature waiting for a user.  I do not need it in 1.6.2

We did not give scripted Porcelains a way to say "this temporary file I am
using for merging is for this path, so use the core.autocrlf and attributes
rules for that final path".  Instead, merge-file simply wrote out the
data in the canonical repository representation.

rerere has the same issue, but it is a lot worse.  It reads the three
files (preimage, postimage and thisimage) from the work tree in the work
tree representation, merges them without converting them to the canonical
representation first but inserts the conflict markers with the canonical
representation and writes the resulting mess out.  It needs to be fixed to
read with convert_to_git(), merge them while they are still in the
canonical representation and possibly add conflict markers, and then write
the results out after convert_to_working_tree().  It also needs to write
in binary mode as well.
