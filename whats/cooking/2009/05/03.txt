What's cooking in git.git (May 2009, #03; Mon, 25)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones
marked with '.' do not appear in any of the branches, but I am still
holding onto them.

The topics list the commits in reverse chronological order.  The topics
meant to be merged to the maintenance series have "maint-" in their names.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* sb/opt-filename (Sat May 23 11:53:13 2009 -0700) 5 commits
 - parse-opts: add OPT_FILENAME and transition builtins
 - parse-opts: prepare for OPT_FILENAME
 - Merge branch 'jc/mktree' into sb/opt-filename
 - Merge branch 'sb/format-patch-parseopt' into sb/opt-filename
 - Merge branch 'sb/show-branch-parse-options' into sb/opt-filename
 - Merge branch 'master' into sb/opt-filename
 + apply, fmt-merge-msg: use relative filenames
 + commit: -F overrides -t

There are quite a few new callers to parse_options() in 'next' and 'pu'
that are more likely to graduate before this series, so for now I merged a
few of them and adjusted the commit "prepare for OPT_FILENAME".  I tried
to be careful but extra sets of eyeballs would be helpful.

* da/araxis-mergetool (Sun May 24 00:24:41 2009 +0000) 1 commit
 + mergetool--lib: add support for araxis merge

I admit that I feel certain distaste in supporting a closed tool, but we
already make things bearable for people on Windows; Araxis is no worse,
right?

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

Rewriting major part of "git-bisect" shell script continues.  The patches

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Stalled and may need help and prodding to go forward]

* lt/read-directory (Fri May 15 12:01:29 2009 -0700) 3 commits
 - Add initial support for pathname conversion to UTF-8
 - read_directory(): infrastructure for pathname character set
   conversion
 - Add 'fill_directory()' helper function for directory traversal

Before adding the real "conversion", this needs a few real fixups, I
think.  For example there is one hardcoded array that is used without
bounds check.

* ar/maint-1.6.2-merge-recursive-d-f (Mon May 11 21:25:36 2009 +0200) 2 commits
 - Fix for a merge where a branch has an F->D transition
 - Add a reminder test case for a merge with F/D transition

Although the reported breakage is covered with the patch, Alex feels the
solution unsatisfactory. Cleaning up D/F conflict handling in merge-recursive
may be long overdue but seems to be a hard problem.

* ps/blame (Thu Mar 12 21:30:03 2009 +1100) 1 commit
 - blame.c: start libifying the blame infrastructure

A few minor point remains in this initial one.  I hate to do these minor
fix-ups myself, but I may end up doing so...

* jc/log-tz (Tue Mar 3 00:45:37 2009 -0800) 1 commit
 - Allow --date=local --date=other-format to work as expected

The one I posted had a few corner-case bugs that was caught with the test
suite; this one has them fixed.  People did not like the UI so it is kept
out of 'next'

* jc/merge-convert (Mon Jan 26 16:45:01 2009 -0800) 1 commit
 - git-merge-file: allow converting the results for the work tree

This is a feature waiting for a user.

We did not give scripted Porcelains a way to say "this temporary file I am
using for merging is for this path, so use the core.autocrlf and attributes
rules for that final path".  Instead, merge-file simply wrote out the
data in the canonical repository representation.

rerere has the same issue, but it is a lot worse.  It reads the three
files (preimage, postimage and thisimage) from the work tree in the work
tree representation, merges them without converting them to the canonical
representation first but inserts the conflict markers with the canonical
representation and writes the resulting mess out.  It needs to be fixed to
read with convert_to_git(), merge them while they are still in the
canonical representation and possibly add conflict markers, and then write
the results out after convert_to_working_tree().  It also needs to write
in binary mode as well.

* db/foreign-scm (Tue Mar 24 23:04:12 2009 -0400) 3 commits
 - Add option for using a foreign VCS
 - Document details of transport function APIs
 - Allow late reporting of fetched hashes

* hv/cvsps-tests (Sun Apr 5 01:40:50 2009 -0700) 8 commits
 - t/t9600: remove exit after test_done
 - cvsimport: extend testcase about patchset order to contain
   branches
 - cvsimport: add test illustrating a bug in cvsps
 - Add a test of "git cvsimport"'s handling of tags and branches
 - Add some tests of git-cvsimport's handling of vendor branches
 - Test contents of entire cvsimported "master" tree contents
 - Use CVS's -f option if available (ignore user's ~/.cvsrc file)
 - Start a library for cvsimport-related tests

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Actively cooking]

* jc/mktree (Thu May 14 15:49:10 2009 -0700) 9 commits
 + mktree: validate entry type in input
 + mktree --batch: build more than one tree object
 + mktree --missing: updated usage message and man page
 + mktree --missing: allow missing objects
 + t1010: add mktree test
 + mktree: do not barf on a submodule commit
 + builtin-mktree.c: use a helper function to handle one line of
   input
 + mktree: use parse-options
 + build-in git-mktree

* jc/maint-add-p-coalesce-fix (Sat May 16 10:48:23 2009 -0700) 2 commits
 + Revert "git-add--interactive: remove hunk coalescing"
 + Splitting a hunk that adds a line at the top fails in "add -p"

* sb/format-patch-parseopt (Sat May 16 02:24:46 2009 -0700) 1 commit
 + format-patch: migrate to parse-options API

* jh/notes (Sat May 16 13:44:17 2009 +0200) 5 commits
 - Teach "-m <msg>" and "-F <file>" to "git notes edit"
 - Add an expensive test for git-notes
 - Speed up git notes lookup
 - Add a script to edit/inspect notes
 - Introduce commit notes

* rc/http-push (Mon May 18 16:14:24 2009 +0800) 15 commits
 - http*: add helper methods for fetching objects (loose)
 - http*: add helper methods for fetching objects/info/packs
 - http*: add helper methods for fetching packs
 - http*: add fetch_http_pack_index
 - http: create function end_url_with_slash
 - http*: move common variables and macros to http.[ch]
 - http-push: do not SEGV after fetching a bad pack idx file
 - http*: copy string returned by sha1_to_hex
 - http-walker: verify remote packs
 - http-push, http-walker: style fixes
 - t5550-http-fetch: test fetching of packed objects
 - http-push: fix missing "#ifdef USE_CURL_MULTI" around
   "is_running_queue"
 - http-push: send out fetch requests on queue
 - t5540-http-push: test fetching of packed objects
 - t5540-http-push: test fetching of loose objects

This is not the re-rolled 18-patch series we discussed yesterday.

* cc/replace (Tue Apr 14 00:36:59 2009 +0200) 13 commits
 - Documentation: add documentation for "git replace"
 - Add git-replace to .gitignore
 - builtin-replace: use "usage_msg_opt" to give better error messages
 - parse-options: add new function "usage_msg_opt"
 - builtin-replace: teach "git replace" to actually replace
 - Add new "git replace" command
 - environment: add global variable to disable replacement
 - mktag: call "check_sha1_signature" with the replacement sha1
 - replace_object: add a test case
 - object: call "check_sha1_signature" with the replacement sha1
 - sha1_file: add a "read_sha1_file_repl" function
 - replace_object: add mechanism to replace objects found in
   "refs/replace/"
 - refs: add a "for_each_replace_ref" function

I suspect an attempt to replace an object that is directly listed on the
command line would not work very well with this series.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[On Hold]

* jc/deny-delete-current-1.7.0 (Mon Feb 9 00:19:46 2009 -0800) 1 commit
 - receive-pack: default receive.denyDeleteCurrent to refuse

* jc/refuse-push-to-current-1.7.0 (Wed Feb 11 02:28:03 2009 -0800) 1 commit
 - Refuse updating the current branch in a non-bare repository via
   push

These are for 1.7.0, but the messages when they trigger together may need
to be rethought.
