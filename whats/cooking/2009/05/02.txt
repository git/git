What's cooking in git.git (May 2009, #02; Sun, 17)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones
marked with '.' do not appear in any of the branches, but I am still
holding onto them.

The topics list the commits in reverse chronological order.  The topics
meant to be merged to the maintenance series have "maint-" in their names.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* jc/mktree (Thu May 14 15:49:10 2009 -0700) 9 commits
 - mktree: validate entry type in input
 - mktree --batch: build more than one tree object
 - mktree --missing: updated usage message and man page
 - mktree --missing: allow missing objects
 - t1010: add mktree test
 - mktree: do not barf on a submodule commit

 - Fix for a merge where a branch has an F->D transition
 - Add a reminder test case for a merge with F/D transition

Although the reported breakage is covered with the patch, Alex feels the
solution unsatisfactory. Cleaning up D/F conflict handling in merge-recursive
may be long overdue but seems to be a hard problem.

 + t3702: fix reliance on SHELL_PATH being '/bin/sh'
 + git-add: introduce --edit (to edit the diff vs. the index)

* jk/maint-add-empty (Tue Apr 28 23:21:01 2009 -0400) 1 commit
 + add: don't complain when adding empty project root

When you say "git add ." in an empty directory, you get "No path matches
''", instead of "No path matches '.'", and this "fixes" it by hiding the
error and making the command silently succeed.  Strictly speaking it
introduces inconsistency, but I think an empty directory is so
uninteresting special case that not signalling it as an error is Ok.

* ar/unlink-err (Wed Apr 29 23:24:52 2009 +0200) 3 commits
 + print unlink(2) errno in copy_or_link_directory
 + replace direct calls to unlink(2) with unlink_or_warn
 + Introduce an unlink(2) wrapper which gives warning if unlink
   failed

* ar/merge-one-file-diag (Wed Apr 29 23:40:50 2009 +0200) 1 commit
 + Clarify kind of conflict in merge-one-file helper

* np/push-delta (Fri May 1 16:56:47 2009 -0400) 1 commit
 + allow OFS_DELTA objects during a push

* mt/submodule-reference (Mon May 4 22:30:01 2009 +0300) 1 commit
 + Add --reference option to git submodule.

* fl/git-pm (Thu May 7 15:41:28 2009 +0200) 2 commits
 + Git.pm: Always set Repository to absolute path if autodetecting
 + Git.pm: Set GIT_WORK_TREE if we set GIT_DIR

* rs/grep-parseopt (Thu May 7 21:46:48 2009 +0200) 5 commits
 + grep: use parseopt
 + grep: remove global variable builtin_grep
 + parseopt: add PARSE_OPT_NODASH
 + parseopt: add OPT_NUMBER_CALLBACK
 + parseopt: add OPT_NEGBIT

* jk/no-no-no-empty-directory (Fri May 8 01:01:17 2009 -0400) 2 commits
 + parseopt: add OPT_NEGBIT
 + parseopt: add OPT_NEGBIT

I somehow botched the commit log message of the top one; it is about
fixing "ls-files --no-empty-directory".

* jk/maint-1.6.0-trace-argv (Fri May 8 05:06:15 2009 -0400) 1 commit
 + fix GIT_TRACE segfault with shell-quoted aliases

* hv/sample-update (Fri May 8 17:22:30 2009 +0200) 1 commit
 + Extend sample update hook, disable modifying of existing tags

* rr/forbid-bs-in-ref (Fri May 8 07:32:37 2009 +0200) 1 commit
 + Disallow '\' in ref names

This retroactively forbids use of what people could have been using
happily, which, strictly speaking, is a no-no, but makes sense in the
longer term.

* do/maint-merge-recursive-fix (Sat May 9 14:49:59 2009 -0700) 1 commit
 + merge-recursive: never leave index unmerged while recursing

* jm/format-patch-no-auto-n-when-k-is-given (Sat May 9 10:12:01 2009 +0200) 1 commit
 + format-patch let -k override a config-specified format.numbered

* lt/maint-diff-reduce-lstat (Sat May 9 15:11:17 2009 -0700) 2 commits
 + Teach 'git checkout' to preload the index contents
 + Avoid unnecessary 'lstat()' calls in 'get_stat_data()'

* cc/bisect (Sat May 9 17:55:47 2009 +0200) 20 commits
 + bisect: make "git bisect" use new "--next-all" bisect-helper
   function
 + bisect: add "check_good_are_ancestors_of_bad" function
 + bisect: implement the "check_merge_bases" function
 + bisect: automatically sort sha1_array if needed when looking it up
 + bisect: make skipped array functions more generic
 + bisect: remove too much function nesting
 + bisect: use new "struct argv_array" to prepare argv for
   "setup_revisions"
 + bisect: store good revisions in a "sha1_array"
 + bisect: implement "rev_argv_push" to fill an argv with revs
 + bisect: use "sha1_array" to store skipped revisions
 + am: simplify "sq" function by using "git rev-parse --sq-quote"
 + bisect: use "git rev-parse --sq-quote" instead of a custom "sq"
   function
 + rev-parse: add --sq-quote to shell quote arguments
 + rev-list: remove stringed output flag from "show_bisect_vars"
 + bisect--helper: remove "--next-vars" option as it is now useless
 + bisect: use "git bisect--helper --next-exit" in "git-bisect.sh"
 + bisect--helper: add "--next-exit" to output bisect results
 + bisect: move common bisect functionality to "bisect_common"
 + rev-list: refactor printing bisect vars
 + rev-list: make "estimate_bisect_steps" non static

Rewriting major part of "git-bisect" shell script continues.  The patches
seem to be reasonably clean.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Stalled and may need help and prodding to go forward]

* ps/blame (Thu Mar 12 21:30:03 2009 +1100) 1 commit
 - blame.c: start libifying the blame infrastructure

A few minor point remains in this initial one.  I hate to do these minor
fix-ups myself, but I may end up doing so...

* jc/log-tz (Tue Mar 3 00:45:37 2009 -0800) 1 commit
 - Allow --date=local --date=other-format to work as expected

The one I posted had a few corner-case bugs that was caught with the test
suite; this one has them fixed.  People did not like the UI so it is kept
out of 'next'

* jc/merge-convert (Mon Jan 26 16:45:01 2009 -0800) 1 commit
 - git-merge-file: allow converting the results for the work tree

This is a feature waiting for a user.

We did not give scripted Porcelains a way to say "this temporary file I am
using for merging is for this path, so use the core.autocrlf and attributes
rules for that final path".  Instead, merge-file simply wrote out the
data in the canonical repository representation.

rerere has the same issue, but it is a lot worse.  It reads the three
files (preimage, postimage and thisimage) from the work tree in the work
tree representation, merges them without converting them to the canonical
representation first but inserts the conflict markers with the canonical
representation and writes the resulting mess out.  It needs to be fixed to
read with convert_to_git(), merge them while they are still in the
canonical representation and possibly add conflict markers, and then write
the results out after convert_to_working_tree().  It also needs to write
in binary mode as well.

* db/foreign-scm (Tue Mar 24 23:04:12 2009 -0400) 3 commits
 - Add option for using a foreign VCS
 - Document details of transport function APIs
 - Allow late reporting of fetched hashes

* hv/cvsps-tests (Sun Apr 5 01:40:50 2009 -0700) 8 commits
 - t/t9600: remove exit after test_done
 - cvsimport: extend testcase about patchset order to contain
   branches
 - cvsimport: add test illustrating a bug in cvsps
 - Add a test of "git cvsimport"'s handling of tags and branches
 - Add some tests of git-cvsimport's handling of vendor branches
 - Test contents of entire cvsimported "master" tree contents
 - Use CVS's -f option if available (ignore user's ~/.cvsrc file)
 - Start a library for cvsimport-related tests

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Actively cooking]

* da/mergetool-lib (Sat May 2 01:57:21 2009 -0700) 1 commit
 - mergetool--lib: specialize diff options for emerge and ecmerge

Can somebody tell me what the current status of this is?  I thought there
was some objection, but I lost track...

* rc/http-push (Sat May 16 11:51:52 2009 +0800) 12 commits
 - http*: add fetch_http_pack_index
 - http: create function end_url_with_slash
 - http*: move common variables and macros to http.[ch]
 - http-push: do not SEGV after fetching a bad pack idx file
 - http*: copy string returned by sha1_to_hex
 - http-walker: verify remote packs
 - http-push, http-walker: style fixes
 - t5550-http-fetch: test fetching of packed objects
 - http-push: fix missing "#ifdef USE_CURL_MULTI" around
   "is_running_queue"
 - http-push: send out fetch requests on queue
 - t5540-http-push: test fetching of packed objects
 - t5540-http-push: test fetching of loose objects

There was an 11-patch updates but in the middle there were some
compilation breakage issues; only early part of that series is queued.

* cc/replace (Tue Apr 14 00:36:59 2009 +0200) 13 commits
 - Documentation: add documentation for "git replace"
 - Add git-replace to .gitignore
 - builtin-replace: use "usage_msg_opt" to give better error messages
 - parse-options: add new function "usage_msg_opt"
 - builtin-replace: teach "git replace" to actually replace
 - Add new "git replace" command
 - environment: add global variable to disable replacement
 - mktag: call "check_sha1_signature" with the replacement sha1
 - replace_object: add a test case
 - object: call "check_sha1_signature" with the replacement sha1
 - sha1_file: add a "read_sha1_file_repl" function
 - replace_object: add mechanism to replace objects found in
   "refs/replace/"
 - refs: add a "for_each_replace_ref" function

I suspect an attempt to replace an object that is directly listed on the
command line would not work very well with this series.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[On Hold]

* jc/deny-delete-current-1.7.0 (Mon Feb 9 00:19:46 2009 -0800) 1 commit
 - receive-pack: default receive.denyDeleteCurrent to refuse

 - Refuse updating the current branch in a non-bare repository via
   push

These are for 1.7.0, but the messages when they trigger together may need
to be rethought.

----------------------------------------------------------------
