What's cooking in git.git (Aug 2009, #06; Sun, 30)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones
marked with '.' do not appear in any of the integration branches, but I am
still holding onto them.

After the 1.6.5 cycle, the next release will be 1.7.0, and we will push
out the planned "push safety" change.  1.7.0 would be a good time to
introduce "justifiable" changes that are not strictly backward compatible.

During 1.6.5 cycle, 'next' will hold topics meant for 1.6.5 and 1.7.0.

[New Topics]

* jc/upload-pack-hook (2009-08-28) 2 commits
 - upload-pack: feed "kind [clone|fetch]" to post-upload-pack hook
 - upload-pack: add a trigger for post-upload-pack hook

I do not know if the distinction between fetching some but not all refs
and fetching full set of refs into an empty repository is something worth
making, so in that sense the tip commit is somewhat iffy.

One reason this series makes me somewhat uneasy is that Tom, the original
starter of the discussion went dark after sending a proposed patch.  Maybe
he has been too busy, but I have been hoping that GitHub as a stakeholder
has somebody who monitors the list when he is not available.

Does anybody from GitHub have any input?  Is there something that needs to
be improved to fill GitHub's needs?  Does GitHub want to stick to its own
fork, and were all these discussions for improvements unwanted?

* jk/clone-b (2009-08-26) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-08-30 at 10a68d1)
 + clone: add --branch option to select a different HEAD

* pk/import-dirs (2009-08-24) 1 commit
 - Add script for importing bits-and-pieces to Git.

This version makes me suspect that the author might regret the choice of
the import format that does not allow escaping of paths, nor does not
allow leading blanks for readability without changing semantics, both of
which make it somewhat limiting and error prone.  These issues will be
hard to rectify without breaking the backward compatibility, for a tool
that could otherwise turn out to be useful.

As a contrib/ material, I probably shouldn't be too worried about these
issues, but I am keeping this out of 'next' for now, just in case the
author chooses to polish the usability of the tool for general audience.

It is a different story if the submission was just throwing out a one-time
hack in the open in the hope that some other people might find it useful,
but without any intention of maintaining it.  But then I do not have a
strong reason to keep this in my tree, either.  The mailing list archive
is a more suitable storage media for such a patch.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* jh/notes (2009-08-27) 12 commits.
 - Add '%N'-format for pretty-printing commit notes
 - Add flags to get_commit_notes() to control the format of the note string
 - notes.c: Implement simple memory pooling of leaf nodes
 - Selftests verifying semantics when loading notes trees with various fanouts
 - Teach the notes lookup code to parse notes trees with various fanout schemes
 - t3302-notes-index-expensive: Speed up create_repo()
 - fast-import: Add support for importing commit notes
 - Teach "-m <msg>" and "-F <file>" to "git notes edit"
 - Add an expensive test for git-notes
 - Speed up git notes lookup
 - Add a script to edit/inspect notes
 - Introduce commit notes

I heard the cvs-helper series depends on this one.  It seems that the
fan-out strategy is being rethought?

* js/stash-dwim (2009-07-27) 1 commit.
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-08-16 at 67896c4)
 + Make 'git stash -k' a short form for 'git stash save --keep-index'
 (this branch is used by tr/reset-checkout-patch.)

* tr/reset-checkout-patch (2009-08-27) 9 commits.
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-08-27 at d314281)
 + Make test case number unique
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-08-18 at e465bb3)
 + tests: disable interactive hunk selection tests if perl is not available
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-08-16 at 67896c4)
 + DWIM 'git stash save -p' for 'git stash -p'
 + Implement 'git stash save --patch'
 + Implement 'git checkout --patch'
 + Implement 'git reset --patch'
 + builtin-add: refactor the meat of interactive_add()
 + Add a small patch-mode testing library
 + git-apply--interactive: Refactor patch mode code
 (this branch uses js/stash-dwim.)

There was a discussion on better DWIMmery for the above two topics to (1)
forbid "git stash save --anything-with-dash" and (2) redirect with any
option "git stash --opt" to "git stash save --opt", to keep it flexible
and safe at the same time.  I think it is a sane thing to do, but nothing
has happened lately.

* db/vcs-helper (2009-08-09) 17 commits
 - Allow helpers to request marks for fast-import
 - Allow helpers to report in "list" command that the ref is unchanged
 - Add support for "import" helper command
 - transport-helper_init(): fix a memory leak in error path
 - Add a config option for remotes to specify a foreign vcs
 - Allow programs to not depend on remotes having urls
 - Allow fetch to modify refs
 - Use a function to determine whether a remote is valid
 - Use a clearer style to issue commands to remote helpers
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-08-07 at f3533ba)
 + Makefile: install hardlinks for git-remote-<scheme> supported by libcurl if possible
 + Makefile: do not link three copies of git-remote-* programs
 + Makefile: git-http-fetch does not need expat
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-08-06 at 15da79d)
 + http-fetch: Fix Makefile dependancies
 + Add transport native helper executables to .gitignore
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-08-05 at 33d491e)
 + git-http-fetch: not a builtin
 + Use an external program to implement fetching with curl
 + Add support for external programs for handling native fetches
 (this branch is used by jh/cvs-helper.)

We had a few messages on what the list consensus was with this series.  My
impression, after going back to the archive, is that there wasn't.

* jn/gitweb-blame (2009-08-06) 3 commits
 - gitweb: Create links leading to 'blame_incremental' using JavaScript
 - gitweb: Incremental blame (WIP)
 - gitweb: Add optional "time to generate page" info in footer

Ajax-y blame WIP

* je/send-email-no-subject (2009-08-05) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-08-30 at b6455c2)
 + send-email: confirm on empty mail subjects

The existing tests to covers the positive case (i.e. as long as the user
says "yes" to the "do you really want to send this message that lacks
subject", the message is sent) of this feature, but the feature itself
needs its own test to verify the negative case (i.e. does it correctly
stop if the user says "no"?)

* lt/approxidate (2009-08-30) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-08-30 at e016e3d)
 + fix approxidate parsing of relative months and years
 + tests: add date printing and parsing tests
 + refactor test-date interface
 + Add date formatting and parsing functions relative to a given time
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-08-26 at 62853f9)
 + Further 'approxidate' improvements
 + Improve on 'approxidate'

Fixes a few "reasonably formatted but thus-far misparsed" date strings.
With tests by Peff, this should be ready for -rc0.

* mr/gitweb-snapshot (2009-08-25) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-08-30 at e4edd0b)
 + gitweb: add t9501 tests for checking HTTP status codes
 + gitweb: split test suite into library and tests
 + gitweb: improve snapshot error handling

* jc/mailinfo-scissors (2009-08-26) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-08-30 at 5fc6248)
 + mailinfo.scissors: new configuration
 + am/mailinfo: Disable scissors processing by default
 + Documentation: describe the scissors mark support of "git am"
 + Teach mailinfo to ignore everything before -- >8 -- mark
 + builtin-mailinfo.c: fix confusing internal API to mailinfo()

I didn't pick up the patch to simplify the definition of scissors. I do
not have strong opinion on it either way, but the list would hopefully
decide it before too long.

* tf/diff-whitespace-incomplete-line (2009-08-23) 2 commits.
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-08-26 at 4fc7784)
 + xutils: Fix xdl_recmatch() on incomplete lines
 + xutils: Fix hashing an incomplete line with whitespaces at the end

Will merge.

 - rebase -i: use "git sequencer--helper --cherry-pick"
 - sequencer: add "--cherry-pick" option to "git sequencer--helper"
 - sequencer: add "do_commit()" and related functions working on "next_commit"
 - pick: libify "pick_help_msg()"
 - revert: libify cherry-pick and revert functionnality
 - rebase -i: use "git sequencer--helper --fast-forward"
 - sequencer: let "git sequencer--helper" callers set "allow_dirty"
 - sequencer: add "--fast-forward" option to "git sequencer--helper"

 - sequencer: add "reset_almost_hard()" and related functions
 - rebase -i: use "git sequencer--helper --make-patch"
 - sequencer: add "make_patch" function to save a patch
 - sequencer: add "builtin-sequencer--helper.c"

Migrating "rebase -i" bit by bit to C.

 - 2/2: Add Python support library for CVS remote helper
 - 1/2: Add Python support library for CVS remote helper
 - Basic build infrastructure for Python scripts
 (this branch uses db/vcs-helper.)

Builds on db/vcs-helper (which is stalled, so this cannot move further at
the moment).  There is a re-roll planned, so I did not pick up test fixes
from Brandon myself.

 - unpack-trees(): "enable" sparse checkout and load $GIT_DIR/info/sparse-checkout
 - unpack-trees.c: generalize verify_* functions
 - unpack-trees(): add CE_WT_REMOVE to remove on worktree alone

--------------------------------------------------
[For 1.7.0]

* jc/1.7.0-status (2009-08-15) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-08-22 at b3507bb)
 + git status: not "commit --dry-run" anymore
 + git stat -s: short status output
 + git stat: the beginning of "status that is not a dry-run of commit"

With this, "git status" is no longer "git commit --preview".

* jc/1.7.0-send-email-no-thread-default (2009-08-22) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-08-22 at 5106de8)
 + send-email: make --no-chain-reply-to the default

* jc/1.7.0-diff-whitespace-only-status (2009-08-30) 4 commits.
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-08-30 at 0623572)
 + diff.c: fix typoes in comments
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-08-27 at 81fb2bd)
 + Make test case number unique
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-08-02 at 9c08420)
 + diff: Rename QUIET internal option to QUICK
 + diff: change semantics of "ignore whitespace" options

This changes exit code from "git diff --ignore-whitespace" and friends
when there is no actual output.  It is a backward incompatible change, but
we could argue that it is a bugfix.

* jc/1.7.0-push-safety (2009-02-09) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-08-02 at 38b82fe)
 + Refuse deleting the current branch via push
 + Refuse updating the current branch in a non-bare repository via push

--------------------------------------------------
[I have been too busy to purge these]

* jc/log-tz (2009-03-03) 1 commit.
 - Allow --date=local --date=other-format to work as expected

Maybe some people care about this.  I dunno.

* jc/mailinfo-remove-brackets (2009-07-15) 1 commit.
 - mailinfo: -b option keeps [bracketed] strings that is not a [PATCH] marker

Maybe some people care about this.  I dunno.

* ar/maint-1.6.2-merge-recursive-d-f (2009-05-11) 2 commits.
 . Fix for a merge where a branch has an F->D transition
 . Add a reminder test case for a merge with F/D transition

* jc/merge-convert (2009-01-26) 1 commit.
 . git-merge-file: allow converting the results for the work tree

* lt/read-directory (2009-05-15) 3 commits.
 . Add initial support for pathname conversion to UTF-8
 . read_directory(): infrastructure for pathname character set conversion
 . Add 'fill_directory()' helper function for directory traversal

* ps/blame (2009-03-12) 1 commit.
 . blame.c: start libifying the blame infrastructure

* pb/tracking (2009-07-16) 7 commits.
 . branch.c: if remote is not config'd for branch, don't try delete push config
 . branch, checkout: introduce autosetuppush
 . move deletion of merge configuration to branch.c
 . remote: add per-remote autosetupmerge and autosetuprebase configuration
 . introduce a struct tracking_config
 . branch: install_branch_config and struct tracking refactoring
 . config: allow false and true values for branch.autosetuprebase

Has been ejected from 'pu' for some time, expecting a reroll.

* ne/rev-cache (2009-08-21) 6 commits
 . support for path name caching in rev-cache
 . full integration of rev-cache into git, completed test suite
 . administrative functions for rev-cache, start of integration into git
 . support for non-commit object caching in rev-cache
 . basic revision cache system, no integration or features
 . man page and technical discussion for rev-cache

Updated but seems to break upload-pack tests when merged to 'pu'; given
what this series touches, breakages in that area are expected.
May discard if a working reroll comes, to give it a fresh start.
