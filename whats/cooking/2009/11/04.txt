What's cooking in git.git (Nov 2009, #04; Mon, 16)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones
marked with '.' do not appear in any of the integration branches, but I am
still holding onto them.

In 1.7.0, we plan to correct handful of warts in the interfaces everybody
agrees that they were mistakes.  The resulting system may not be strictly
backward compatible.  Currently planned changes are:

 * refuse push to update the checked out branch in a non-bare repo by
   default

   Make "git push" into a repository to update the branch that is checked
   out fail by default.  You can countermand this default by setting a
   configuration variable in the receiving repository.

   http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/107758/focus=108007

 * refuse push to delete the current branch by default

   Make "git push $there :$killed" to delete the branch that is pointed at
   by its HEAD fail by default.  You can countermand this default by
   setting a configuration variable in the receiving repository.

   http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/108862/focus=108936

 * git-send-email won't make deep threads by default

   Many people said that by default when sending more than 2 patches the
   threading git-send-email makes by default is hard to read, and they
   prefer the default be one cover letter and each patch as a direct
   follow-up to the cover letter.  You can countermand this by setting a
   configuration variable.

   http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/109790

 * git-status won't be "git-commit --dry-run" anymore

   http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/125989/focus=125993

 * "git-diff -w --exit-code" will exit success if only differences it
   found are whitespace changes that are stripped away from the output.

   http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/119731/focus=119751

I wasn't fully functioning for the past few days, so this round we have
only added new topics and new patches to existing ones, without changing
the status of individual topics very much.

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* bs/maint-pre-commit-hook-sample (2009-11-05) 1 commit.
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-11-06 at d70f646)
 + pre-commit.sample: Diff against the empty tree when HEAD is invalid

  (merged to 'next' on 2009-11-10 at 5619714)
 + diff --color-words: bit of clean-up

  (merged to 'next' on 2009-10-31 at 194b5c5)
 + mergetool--lib: add p4merge as a pre-configured mergetool option

I do not do p4 nor use difftool, so it's much easier for me to merge this
to 'master' and wait for anybody to scream if there is breakage.

* jk/maint-add-p-empty (2009-10-27) 1 commit.
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-10-30 at 2bd302f)

  (merged to 'next' on 2009-10-30 at 403bbfe)
 + Teach --wrap to only indent without wrapping
 + Add strbuf_add_wrapped_text() to utf8.[ch]

* tz/maint-rpm (2009-11-11) 1 commit.
 + Makefile: Ensure rpm packages can be read by older rpm versions

[Stalled]

* rj/cygwin-msvc (2009-11-09) 3 commits.
 - Add explicit Cygwin check to guard WIN32 header inclusion
 - MSVC: Add support for building with NO_MMAP
 - Makefile: keep MSVC and Cygwin configuration separate
 (this branch uses rj/maint-simplify-cygwin-makefile.)

I think J6t was not happy with the tip one.

* jc/fix-tree-walk (2009-10-22) 11 commits.
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-10-22 at 10c0c8f)
 + Revert failed attempt since 353c5ee
 + read-tree --debug-unpack
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-10-11 at 0b058e2)
 + unpack-trees.c: look ahead in the index
 + unpack-trees.c: prepare for looking ahead in the index
 + Aggressive three-way merge: fix D/F case
 + traverse_trees(): handle D/F conflict case sanely
 + more D/F conflict tests
 + tests: move convenience regexp to match object names to test-lib.sh
 + unpack_callback(): use unpack_failed() consistently
 + unpack-trees: typofix
 + diff-lib.c: fix misleading comments on oneway_diff()

This has some stupid bugs and temporarily reverted from 'next' until I can
fix it, but the "temporarily" turned out to be very loooong.  Sigh...

* jh/notes (2009-10-09) 22 commits.
 - fast-import: Proper notes tree manipulation using the notes API
 - Refactor notes concatenation into a flexible interface for combining notes
 - Notes API: Allow multiple concurrent notes trees with new struct notes_tree
 - Notes API: for_each_note(): Traverse the entire notes tree with a callback
 - Notes API: get_note(): Return the note annotating the given object
 - Notes API: add_note(): Add note objects to the internal notes tree structure
 - Notes API: init_notes(): Initialize the notes tree from the given notes ref
 - Notes API: get_commit_notes() -> format_note() + remove the commit restriction
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-11-01 at 948327a)
 + Add selftests verifying concatenation of multiple notes for the same commit
 + Refactor notes code to concatenate multiple notes annotating the same object
 + Add selftests verifying that we can parse notes trees with various fanouts
 + Teach the notes lookup code to parse notes trees with various fanout schemes
 + Teach notes code to free its internal data structures on request

 + Teach "-m <msg>" and "-F <file>" to "git notes edit"
 + Add an expensive test for git-notes
 + Speed up git notes lookup
 + Add a script to edit/inspect notes
 + Introduce commit notes

I somehow thought that the later API part was waiting for updates but
nothing seems to be happening.

* jn/gitweb-blame (2009-09-01) 5 commits.
 - gitweb: Minify gitweb.js if JSMIN is defined
 - gitweb: Create links leading to 'blame_incremental' using JavaScript
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-10-11 at 73c4a83)
 + gitweb: Colorize 'blame_incremental' view during processing
 + gitweb: Incremental blame (using JavaScript)
 + gitweb: Add optional "time to generate page" info in footer

Ajax-y blame.  Any progress or RFH?

* sr/gfi-options (2009-09-06) 6 commits.
 - fast-import: test the new option command
 - fast-import: add option command
 - fast-import: test the new feature command
 - fast-import: add feature command
 - fast-import: put marks reading in it's own function
 - fast-import: put option parsing code in separate functions

It seemed to be moving again soon, but nothing has happened yet...

* je/send-email-no-subject (2009-08-05) 1 commit.
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-10-11 at 1b99c56)
 + send-email: confirm on empty mail subjects

The existing tests cover the positive case (i.e. as long as the user says
"yes" to the "do you really want to send this message that lacks subject",
the message is sent) of this feature, but the feature itself needs its own
test to verify the negative case (i.e. does it correctly stop if the user
says "no"?)

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* jn/help-everywhere (2009-11-09) 21 commits
 - diff --no-index: make the usage string less scary
 - merge-{recursive,subtree}: use usagef() to print usage
 - Introduce usagef() that takes a printf-style format
 - Let 'git <command> -h' show usage without a git dir
 - Show usage string for 'git http-push -h'
 - Let 'git http-fetch -h' show usage outside any git repository
 - Show usage string for 'git stripspace -h'
 - Show usage string for 'git unpack-file -h'
 - Show usage string for 'git show-index -h'
 - Show usage string for 'git rev-parse -h'
 - Show usage string for 'git merge-one-file -h'
 - Show usage string for 'git mailsplit -h'
 - Show usage string for 'git imap-send -h'
 - Show usage string for 'git get-tar-commit-id -h'
 - Show usage string for 'git fast-import -h'
 - Show usage string for 'git check-ref-format -h'
 - Show usage string for 'git show-ref -h'
 - Show usage string for 'git merge-ours -h'
 - Show usage string for 'git commit-tree -h'
 - Show usage string for 'git cherry -h'
 - Show usage string for 'git grep -h'
 (this branch uses jn/maint-http-fetch-mingw and jn/remove-fetch--tool.)

There were unrelated but still worthy fixes, so I reordered some of them;
also the "usage()" change is different from the one that was posted (see
my comment in $gmane/132592).

* jn/maint-http-fetch-mingw (2009-11-09) 1 commit.
 - http-fetch: add missing initialization of argv0_path
 (this branch is used by jn/help-everywhere.)

* jn/remove-fetch--tool (2009-11-09) 1 commit
 - Retire fetch--tool helper to contrib/examples
 (this branch is used by jn/help-everywhere.)

These two were originally part of the "help-everywhere" topic but
they can stand on their own.

All of the above should be ready for 'next'.

* jc/log-stdin (2009-11-03) 1 commit
 - Teach --stdin option to "log" family

This is not signed-off (see $gmane/131971 for list of things you can do to
help advancing this topic).

* jn/gitweb-log-history (2009-11-13) 3 commits
 - gitweb: Make 'history' view (re)use git_log_generic()
 - gitweb: Refactor common parts of 'log' and 'shortlog' views
 - gitweb: Refactor 'log' action generation, adding git_log_body()

Soon in 'next'

* jn/rfc-pull-rebase-error-message (2009-11-12) 1 commit
 - git-pull.sh --rebase: overhaul error handling when no candidates are found

I heard this needs at least retitling among other changes?

* np/maint-sideband-favor-status (2009-11-11) 1 commit.
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-11-15 at 3ecd874)
 + give priority to progress messages

Soon in 'master'.

* rg/doc-workflow (2009-11-15) 3 commits.
 - [An RFC fix-up to further reword release section]
 - Corrections to release management section in gitworkflows.txt
 - Add branch management for releases to gitworkflows

Thomas's further rewording is added to the top but its log message needs
rewriting and the text might need further restructuring.

* sb/ls-tree-parseopt (2009-11-13) 2 commits.
 - ls-tree: migrate to parse-options
 - t3101: test more ls-tree options

Looked fine but the test needs to be updated.  --abbrev=5 does not
guarantee that output is always 5 hexdigits long.

* jl/submodule-add-noname (2009-09-22) 1 commit.
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-11-15 at 3a77d01)
 + git submodule add: make the <path> parameter optional

Dscho started an interesting discussion regarding the larger workflow in
which the "submodule add" is used.  I think the patch itself makes sense
but at the same time it probably makes sense to also take the <path> and
infer the <repository> as Dscho suggested, probably in "git submodule
add", not in "git add" proper, at least initially.

* sc/protocol-doc (2009-11-03) 1 commit.
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-11-15 at 32d6de8)
 + Update packfile transfer protocol documentation

* tr/filter-branch (2009-11-10) 2 commits.
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-11-15 at 79c6a1d)
 + filter-branch: nearest-ancestor rewriting outside subdir filter
 + filter-branch: stop special-casing $filter_subdir argument

Updated again.  Looked sane, except that the option might not be
necessary, but that can be fixed while in 'next'.

* em/commit-claim (2009-11-04) 1 commit
 - commit -c/-C/--amend: reset timestamp and authorship to committer with --reset-author

I just picked better bits from both versions, but this needs to be
rethought.

* bg/format-patch-doc-update (2009-11-07) 4 commits.
 - format-patch: Add "--no-stat" as a synonym for "-p"
 - format-patch documentation: Fix formatting
 - format-patch documentation: Remove diff options that are not useful
 - format-patch: Always generate a patch

Looked sensible, even though this may want to wait for 1.7.0.  We'll see
when we merge this to 'next'.  I tweaked the --no-stat patch with noneg
bit; please check for sanity.

* rj/maint-simplify-cygwin-makefile (2009-10-27) 1 commit.
 - Makefile: merge two Cygwin configuration sections into one
 (this branch is used by rj/cygwin-msvc.)

This is one of the most obviously correct bit from "Compiling on Cygwin
using MSVC fails" topic.

* bg/fetch-multi (2009-11-10) 9 commits.

 - Add missing test for 'git remote update --prune'
 - Add the configuration option skipFetchAll
 - Teach the --multiple option to 'git fetch'
 - Teach the --all option to 'git fetch'

* cc/bisect-doc (2009-11-08) 1 commit
 - Documentation: add "Fighting regressions with git bisect" article

Any comments?  Should it go to Documentation/technical instead?

* sb/tutorial-test (2009-11-06) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-11-15 at 5c82651)
 + t1200: prepare for merging with Fast-forward bikeshedding
 + t1200: further modernize test script style
 + t1200: Make documentation and test agree
 + t1200: cleanup and modernize test style

* jn/editor-pager (2009-10-30) 9 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-11-15 at 7f3e3ae)
 + Provide a build time default-pager setting
 + Provide a build time default-editor setting
 + am -i, git-svn: use "git var GIT_PAGER"
 + add -i, send-email, svn, p4, etc: use "git var GIT_EDITOR"
 + Teach git var about GIT_PAGER
 + Teach git var about GIT_EDITOR
 + Suppress warnings from "git var -l"
 + Do not use VISUAL editor on dumb terminals
 + Handle more shell metacharacters in editor names

* bw/autoconf-more (2009-11-04) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-11-15 at e86a8c9)
 + configure: add settings for gitconfig, editor and pager
 + configure: add macro to set arbitrary make variables

This will follow jn/editor-pager series.

Re-rolled series that contains Daniel's and Johan's.
Any comments?  Is everybody happy?

 - gitweb: Smarter snapshot names
 - gitweb: Document current snapshot rules via new tests
 - t/gitweb-lib.sh: Split gitweb output into headers and body
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-10-11 at 22ba047)
 + gitweb: check given hash before trying to create snapshot

Replaced commits near the tip with recent updates.

* jp/fetch-cull-many-refs (2009-11-13) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-11-15 at db0f967)

  (merged to 'next' on 2009-10-22 at f46a28a)
 + bug: precomputed completion includes scripts sources
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-10-14 at adf722a)
 + Speedup bash completion loading

Reverted out of 'next', to be replaced with jn/faster-completion-startup
topic.

 - update-index: refactor mark_valid() in preparation for new options

The latest update I didn't look at very closely but I had an impression
that it was touching very generic codepath that would affect non sparse
cases, iow the patch looked very scary (the entire series already is).

--------------------------------------------------
[For 1.7.0]

* jc/1.7.0-no-commit-no-ff-2 (2009-10-22) 1 commit.
 - git-merge: forbid fast-forward and up-to-date when --no-commit is given

This makes "git merge --no-commit" fail when it results in fast-forward or
up-to-date.  I haven't described this at the beginning of this message
yet, as it is not clear if this change is even necessary.  Opinions?

* jk/1.7.0-status (2009-09-05) 5 commits.
 - docs: note that status configuration affects only long format
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-10-11 at 65c8513)
 + commit: support alternate status formats
 + status: add --porcelain output format
 + status: refactor format option parsing
 + status: refactor short-mode printing to its own function
 (this branch uses jc/1.7.0-status.)

Gives the --short output format to post 1.7.0 "git commit --dry-run" that
is similar to that of post 1.7.0 "git status".

The tip one is not in 'next' as I have been hoping that somebody may want
to change the code to make it unnecessary, but it does not seem to be
happening, so probably it should also go to 'next'.

* jc/1.7.0-status (2009-09-05) 4 commits.
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-10-11 at 9558627)
 + status: typo fix in usage
 + git status: not "commit --dry-run" anymore
 + git stat -s: short status output
 + git stat: the beginning of "status that is not a dry-run of commit"
 (this branch is used by jk/1.7.0-status.)

With this, "git status" is no longer "git commit --dry-run".

* jc/1.7.0-send-email-no-thread-default (2009-08-22) 1 commit.
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-10-11 at 043acdf)
 + send-email: make --no-chain-reply-to the default

* jc/1.7.0-diff-whitespace-only-status (2009-08-30) 4 commits.
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-10-11 at 546c74d)
 + diff.c: fix typoes in comments
 + Make test case number unique
 + diff: Rename QUIET internal option to QUICK
 + diff: change semantics of "ignore whitespace" options

This changes exit code from "git diff --ignore-whitespace" and friends
when there is no actual output.  It is a backward incompatible change, but
we could argue that it is a bugfix.

* jc/1.7.0-push-safety (2009-02-09) 2 commits.
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-10-11 at 81b8128)
 + Refuse deleting the current branch via push
 + Refuse updating the current branch in a non-bare repository via push

[I have been too busy to purge these]

* ne/rev-cache (2009-10-19) 7 commits.
 . support for commit grafts, slight change to general mechanism
 . support for path name caching in rev-cache
 . full integration of rev-cache into git, completed test suite
 . administrative functions for rev-cache, start of integration into git
 . support for non-commit object caching in rev-cache
 . basic revision cache system, no integration or features
 . man page and technical discussion for rev-cache

The author indicated that there is another round coming.  Does not seem to
pass the tests when merged to 'pu', so it has been ejected for now.

* jc/log-tz (2009-03-03) 1 commit.
 - Allow --date=local --date=other-format to work as expected

Maybe some people care about this.  I dunno.

* jc/mailinfo-remove-brackets (2009-07-15) 1 commit.
 - mailinfo: -b option keeps [bracketed] strings that is not a [PATCH] marker

Maybe some people care about this.  I dunno.

* pb/gitweb-no-project-list (2009-11-06) 3 commits.
 . gitweb: Polish the content tags support
 . gitweb: Support for no project list on gitweb front page
 . gitweb: Refactor project list routines

I picked these up but didn't queue as Warthog9's comments made certain
amount of sense to me.
