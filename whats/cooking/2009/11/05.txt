What's cooking in git.git (Nov 2009, #05; Sun, 22)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones
marked with '.' do not appear in any of the integration branches, but I am
still holding onto them.

In 1.7.0, we plan to correct handful of warts in the interfaces everybody
agrees that they were mistakes.  The resulting system may not be strictly
backward compatible.  Currently planned changes are:

 * refuse push to update the checked out branch in a non-bare repo by
   default

   Make "git push" into a repository to update the branch that is checked
   out fail by default.  You can countermand this default by setting a
   configuration variable in the receiving repository.

   http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/107758/focus=108007

 * refuse push to delete the current branch by default

   Make "git push $there :$killed" to delete the branch that is pointed at
   by its HEAD fail by default.  You can countermand this default by
   setting a configuration variable in the receiving repository.

   http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/108862/focus=108936

 * "git send-email" won't make deep threads by default

   Many people said that by default when sending more than 2 patches the
   threading git-send-email makes by default is hard to read, and they
   prefer the default be one cover letter and each patch as a direct
   follow-up to the cover letter.  You can countermand this by setting a
   configuration variable.

   http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/109790

 * git-status won't be "git-commit --dry-run" anymore

   http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/125989/focus=125993

 * "git diff -w --exit-code" will exit success if only differences it
   found are whitespace changes that are stripped away from the output.

   http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/119731/focus=119751

 * "git diff -w/-b" won't even produce "diff --git" header when all changes
   are about whitespaces.

   http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/133256

Tonight's tip of 'master' is at v1.6.6-rc0.  I am aware of a handful of
patches sent today but they didn't arraive before I started today's
integration cycle and are left out from today's tree.

  (merged to 'next' on 2009-11-15 at 3a77d01)
 + git submodule add: make the <path> parameter optional

Dscho started an interesting discussion regarding the larger workflow in
which the "submodule add" is used.  I think the patch itself makes sense
but at the same time it probably makes sense to also take the <path> and
infer the <repository> as Dscho suggested, probably in "git submodule
add", not in "git add" proper, at least initially.

 - fast-import: test the new option command
 - fast-import: add option command
 - fast-import: test the new feature command
 - fast-import: add feature command

* je/send-email-no-subject (2009-08-05) 1 commit.
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-10-11 at 1b99c56)
 + send-email: confirm on empty mail subjects

The existing tests cover the positive case (i.e. as long as the user says
"yes" to the "do you really want to send this message that lacks subject",
the message is sent) of this feature, but the feature itself needs its own
test to verify the negative case (i.e. does it correctly stop if the user
says "no"?)

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* jh/notes (2009-11-20) 10 commits
 - Add more testcases to test fast-import of notes
 - Rename t9301 to t9350, to make room for more fast-import tests
 - fast-import: Proper notes tree manipulation using the notes API
 - Refactor notes concatenation into a flexible interface for combining notes
 - Notes API: Allow multiple concurrent notes trees with new struct notes_tree
 - Notes API: for_each_note(): Traverse the entire notes tree with a callback
 - Notes API: get_note(): Return the note annotating the given object
 - Notes API: add_note(): Add note objects to the internal notes tree structure
 - Notes API: init_notes(): Initialize the notes tree from the given notes ref
 - Notes API: get_commit_notes() -> format_note() + remove the commit restriction

Early part has been lived in 'next' for a while and has graduated.  This
is a reroll of the remainder.  Is everybody happy with merging this to
'next'?  I saw some checkpatch style violations, but didn't find anything
objectionable in the logic.

* jn/gitweb-blame (2009-11-19) 6 commits.
 - gitweb.js: fix null object exception in initials calculation

Ajax-y blame, with a few recent fixes.

 - sparse checkout: inhibit empty worktree
 - Add tests for sparse checkout
 - read-tree: add --no-sparse-checkout to disable sparse checkout support
 - unpack-trees(): ignore worktree check outside checkout area
 - unpack_trees(): apply $GIT_DIR/info/sparse-checkout to the final index

The latest update I didn't look at very closely but I had an impression
that it was touching very generic codepath that would affect non sparse
cases, iow the patch looked very scary (the entire series already is).

--------------------------------------------------
[For 1.7.0]

* jc/1.7.0-no-commit-no-ff-2 (2009-10-22) 1 commit.
 - git-merge: forbid fast-forward and up-to-date when --no-commit is given

This makes "git merge --no-commit" fail when it results in fast-forward or
up-to-date.  I haven't described this at the beginning of this message
yet, as it is not clear if this change is even necessary.  Opinions?

* jk/1.7.0-status (2009-09-05) 5 commits.
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-11-21 at 884bb56)
 + docs: note that status configuration affects only long format
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-10-11 at 65c8513)
 + commit: support alternate status formats
 + status: add --porcelain output format
 + status: refactor format option parsing
 + status: refactor short-mode printing to its own function
 (this branch uses jc/1.7.0-status.)

Gives the --short output format to post 1.7.0 "git commit --dry-run" that
is similar to that of post 1.7.0 "git status".

* jc/1.7.0-status (2009-09-05) 4 commits.
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-10-11 at 9558627)
 + status: typo fix in usage
 + git status: not "commit --dry-run" anymore
 + git stat -s: short status output
 + git stat: the beginning of "status that is not a dry-run of commit"
 (this branch is used by jk/1.7.0-status.)

With this, "git status" is no longer "git commit --dry-run".

* jc/1.7.0-send-email-no-thread-default (2009-08-22) 1 commit.
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-10-11 at 043acdf)
 + send-email: make --no-chain-reply-to the default

* jc/1.7.0-diff-whitespace-only-status (2009-08-30) 4 commits.
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-10-11 at 546c74d)
 + diff.c: fix typoes in comments
 + Make test case number unique
 + diff: Rename QUIET internal option to QUICK
 + diff: change semantics of "ignore whitespace" options

This changes exit code from "git diff --ignore-whitespace" and friends
when there is no actual output.  It is a backward incompatible change, but
we could argue that it is a bugfix.

* jc/1.7.0-push-safety (2009-02-09) 2 commits.
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-10-11 at 81b8128)
 + Refuse deleting the current branch via push
 + Refuse updating the current branch in a non-bare repository via push

* pb/gitweb-no-project-list (2009-11-06) 3 commits.
 . gitweb: Polish the content tags support
 . gitweb: Support for no project list on gitweb front page
