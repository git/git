What's cooking in git.git (Jan 2009, #06; Sat, 24)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones
marked with '.' do not appear in any of the branches, but I am still
holding onto them.

The topics list the commits in reverse chronological order.  The topics
meant to be merged to the maintenance series have "maint-" in their names.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* jg/mergetool (Sat Jan 24 00:12:45 2009 +0100) 1 commit
 - [wait for an ack from ted] mergetool: Don't repeat merge tool
   candidates

* cb/mergetool (Wed Jan 21 22:57:48 2009 +0000) 1 commit
 - [wait for ack from ted] mergetool: respect autocrlf by using
   checkout-index

* jc/commit-assume-also-during-merge (Thu Jan 22 22:21:49 2009 -0800) 3 commits
 - git commit: pathspec without -i/-o implies -i semantics during a
   merge
 - builtin-commit: shorten eye-sore overlong lines
 - Add "partial commit" tests during a conflicted merge

This is only meant as a weatherballoon to help facilitate discussion.

* sr/clone-empty (Fri Jan 23 01:07:32 2009 +0100) 1 commit
 + Allow cloning an empty repository

At last ;-)  This is a reasonable thing to do, and should be fast tracked
to 'master'.

* cc/replace (Fri Jan 23 10:07:46 2009 +0100) 7 commits
 - environment: add global variable to disable replacement
 - mktag: call "check_sha1_signature" with the replacement sha1
 - replace_object: add a test case
 - object: call "check_sha1_signature" with the replacement sha1
 - sha1_file: add a "read_sha1_file_repl" function
 - replace_object: add mechanism to replace objects found in
   "refs/replace/"
 - refs: add a "for_each_replace_ref" function

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Stalled and may need help and prodding to go forward]

* jc/blame (Wed Jun 4 22:58:40 2008 -0700) 2 commits
 + blame: show "previous" information in --porcelain/--incremental
   format
 + git-blame: refactor code to emit "porcelain format" output

This gives Porcelains (like gitweb) the information on the commit _before_
the one that the final blame is laid on, which should save them one
rev-parse to dig further.  The line number in the "previous" information
may need refining, and sanity checking code for reference counting may
need to be resurrected before this can move forward.

* db/foreign-scm (Sun Jan 11 15:12:10 2009 -0500) 3 commits
 - Support fetching from foreign VCSes
 - Add specification of git-vcs helpers
 - Add "vcs" config option in remotes

The "spec" did not seem quite well cooked yet, but in the longer term I
think something like this to allow interoperating with other SCMs as if
the other end is a native git repository is a very worthy goal.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Reverted]

* mh/unify-color (Fri Jan 23 01:25:23 2009 -0800) 3 commits
 ? Revert previous two commits
 ? move the color variables to color.c
 ? handle color.ui at a central place

This broke git-format-patch badly.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Actively cooking]

* js/valgrind (Wed Jan 21 02:36:40 2009 +0100) 2 commits
 - valgrind: ignore ldso errors
 - Add valgrind support in test scripts

Dscho seems to have some updates out of discussion with Peff, which is not
queued here.

* sp/runtime-prefix (Sun Jan 18 13:00:15 2009 +0100) 7 commits
 - Windows: Revert to default paths and convert them by
   RUNTIME_PREFIX
 - Compute prefix at runtime if RUNTIME_PREFIX is set
 - Modify setup_path() to only add git_exec_path() to PATH
 - Add calls to git_extract_argv0_path() in programs that call
   git_config_*
 - git_extract_argv0_path(): Move check for valid argv0 from caller
   to callee
 - Refactor git_set_argv0_path() to git_extract_argv0_path()
 - Move computation of absolute paths from Makefile to runtime (in
   preparation for RUNTIME_PREFIX)

We should move this to 'next' soon with J6t's blessing.

* lh/submodule-tree-traversal (Mon Jan 12 00:45:55 2009 +0100) 3 commits
 + builtin-ls-tree: enable traversal of submodules
 + archive.c: enable traversal of submodules
 + tree.c: add support for traversal of submodules

There were a few updates posted, which I haven't picked up.

* jk/signal-cleanup (Thu Jan 22 01:03:28 2009 -0500) 5 commits
 - pager: do wait_for_pager on signal death
 - refactor signal handling for cleanup functions
 - chain kill signals for cleanup functions
 - diff: refactor tempfile cleanup handling
 - Windows: Fix signal numbers

Ready for 'next', but not tonight (yet).

* ks/maint-mailinfo-folded (Tue Jan 13 01:21:04 2009 +0300) 5 commits
 - mailinfo: tests for RFC2047 examples
 - mailinfo: add explicit test for mails like '<a.u.thor@example.com>
   (A U Thor)'
 - mailinfo: more smarter removal of rfc822 comments from 'From'
 + mailinfo: 'From:' header should be unfold as well
 + mailinfo: correctly handle multiline 'Subject:' header

As far as I can see, the only remaining thing is a minor fix-up in the
"comment removal" one before we can move this fully to 'next'.

* js/notes (Tue Jan 13 20:57:16 2009 +0100) 6 commits
 + git-notes: fix printing of multi-line notes
 + notes: fix core.notesRef documentation
 + Add an expensive test for git-notes
 + Speed up git notes lookup
 + Add a script to edit/inspect notes
 + Introduce commit notes

It would be nice to hear a real world success story using the notes
mechanism; Dscho says he also wants to make sure the current choice
of the structure scales well before casting it in stone.

* sc/gitweb-category (Fri Dec 12 00:45:12 2008 +0100) 3 commits
 - gitweb: Optional grouping of projects by category
 - gitweb: Split git_project_list_body in two functions
 - gitweb: Modularized git_get_project_description to be more generic

Design discussion between Jakub and Sebastien continues.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* js/patience-diff (Thu Jan 1 17:39:37 2009 +0100) 3 commits
 + bash completions: Add the --patience option
 + Introduce the diff option '--patience'
 + Implement the patience diff algorithm

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Will merge to "master" soon]

 + lstat_cache(): introduce clear_lstat_cache() function
 + lstat_cache(): introduce invalidate_lstat_cache() function
 + lstat_cache(): introduce has_dirs_only_path() function
 + lstat_cache(): introduce has_symlink_or_noent_leading_path()
   function
 + lstat_cache(): more cache effective symlink/directory detection

* tr/previous-branch (Wed Jan 21 00:37:38 2009 -0800) 10 commits
 + Simplify parsing branch switching events in reflog
 + Introduce for_each_recent_reflog_ent().
 + interpret_nth_last_branch(): plug small memleak
 + Fix reflog parsing for a malformed branch switching entry
 + Fix parsing of @{-1}@{1}
 + interpret_nth_last_branch(): avoid traversing the reflog twice
 + checkout: implement "-" abbreviation, add docs and tests
 + sha1_name: support @{-N} syntax in get_sha1()
 + sha1_name: tweak @{-N} lookup
 + checkout: implement "@{-N}" shortcut name for N-th last branch

 + revision walker: include a detached HEAD in --all
