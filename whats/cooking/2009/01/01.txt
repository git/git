What's cooking in git.git (Jan 2009, #01; Mon, 05)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed
with '-' are only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are
in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of the branches,
but I am still holding onto them.

The topics list the commits in reverse chronological order.  The topics
meant to be merged to the maintenance series have "maint-" in their names.

Sorry to have been lagging a bit.  There are a few patches I am interested
in but haven't studied yet nor mentioned here.  I've been swamped outside
git lately for the past few days, but hopefully I can get to them shortly.

----------------------------------------------------------------

 + git-sh-setup: Fix scripts whose PWD is a symlink to a work-dir on
   OS X

All of the above are good fixes and clean-ups; will be fast-tracked to
'master' and maintenance branches as appropriate.

* mv/apply-parse-opt (Sun Dec 28 00:03:57 2008 +0100) 1 commit
 + parse-opt: migrate builtin-apply.

 + Documentation: clarify which parameters are optional to git-cherry
 + git-cherry: make <upstream> parameter optional

* rs/maint-shortlog-foldline (Mon Dec 29 23:15:50 2008 +0100) 1 commit
 - [Need tidying up the log] pretty: support multiline subjects with
   format:

* tr/rebase-root (Fri Jan 2 23:28:29 2009 +0100) 4 commits
 - rebase: update documentation for --root
 - rebase -i: learn to rebase root commit
 - rebase: learn to rebase root commit
 - rebase -i: execute hook only after argument checking

I should be able to find time to read this over again and merge to
'next' sometime this week.

* as/autocorrect-alias (Sun Jan 4 18:16:01 2009 +0100) 1 commit
 + git.c: make autocorrected aliases work

* as/commit-signoff (Mon Dec 29 12:16:45 2008 +0100) 1 commit
 - [WIP] Add a commit.signoff configuration option to always use --
   signoff in commit

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Stalled and may need help and prodding to go forward]

* wp/add-patch-find (Thu Nov 27 04:08:03 2008 +0000) 3 commits
 . In add --patch, Handle K,k,J,j slightly more gracefully.
 . Add / command in add --patch
 . git-add -i/-p: Change prompt separater from slash to comma

Will discard and wait for a resubmit.

* kb/am-directory (Fri Aug 29 15:27:50 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 . git-am: Pass the --directory option through to git-apply

A reroll of this by Simon Schubert triggered a series to fix a parameter
propagation bug, and another reroll to add "git am --directory=path/"
should be much easier now.  I am not likely to use the feature myself, so
it is up to intrested volunteers to carry it forward.

* ds/uintmax-config (Mon Nov 3 09:14:28 2008 -0900) 1 commit
 - autoconf: Enable threaded delta search when pthreads are supported

This automatically enables threaded delta search code when autoconf
detects pthreads are usable.  I haven't heard neither positive nor
negative comments from minority platforms that might be harmed, but
this feels like the right thing to do, so perhaps the best course of
action is to merge this down to 'master' and see if anybody screams.

* jc/blame (Wed Jun 4 22:58:40 2008 -0700) 2 commits
 + blame: show "previous" information in --porcelain/--incremental
   format
 + git-blame: refactor code to emit "porcelain format" output

This gives Porcelains (like gitweb) the information on the commit _before_
the one that the final blame is laid on, which should save them one
rev-parse to dig further.  The line number in the "previous" information
may need refining, and sanity checking code for reference counting may
need to be resurrected before this can move forward.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Actively cooking]

* nd/grep-assume-unchanged (Sat Dec 27 15:21:03 2008 +0700) 2 commits
 + grep: grep cache entries if they are "assume unchanged"
 + grep: support --no-ext-grep to test builtin grep

* as/maint-shortlog-cleanup (Tue Dec 30 22:01:44 2008 +0100) 1 commit

   unnecessarily

* jc/maint-ls-tree (Wed Dec 31 19:00:50 2008 +0900) 2 commits

 + mergetool: Add prompt to continue after failing to merge a file
 + Add -y/--no-prompt option to mergetool
 + Fix some tab/space inconsistencies in git-mergetool.sh

----------------------------------------------------------------

 + gitweb: unify boolean feature subroutines

* cb/merge-recursive-fix (Mon Dec 15 02:41:24 2008 -0800) 3 commits

   recursive-fix
 + merge-recursive: do not clobber untracked working tree garbage
 + modify/delete conflict resolution overwrites untracked file

 - wt-status: show sparse checkout info
 - Introduce default sparse patterns (core.defaultsparse)
 - checkout: add new options to support sparse checkout
 - clone: support sparse checkout with --sparse-checkout option
 - unpack_trees(): add support for sparse checkout
 - unpack_trees(): keep track of unmerged entries
 - Introduce "sparse patterns"
 - Merge branch 'master' into nd/narrow
 - t2104: touch portability fix
 - grep: skip files outside sparse checkout area
 - checkout_entry(): CE_NO_CHECKOUT on checked out entries.
 - Prevent diff machinery from examining worktree outside sparse
   checkout
 - ls-files: Add tests for --sparse and friends
 - update-index: add --checkout/--no-checkout to update
   CE_NO_CHECKOUT bit
 - update-index: refactor mark_valid() in preparation for new options
 - ls-files: add options to support sparse checkout
 - Introduce CE_NO_CHECKOUT bit

Will drop shortly, but there may be some other fixes to CE_VALID, like
nd/grep-assume-unchanged topic above, that we may want to resurrect.

* jc/clone-symref-2 (Sat Nov 29 23:38:21 2008 -0800) 7 commits
 - clone: test the new HEAD detection logic
 - Merge commit 'HEAD@{2}' into HEAD
 - upload-pack: send the HEAD information
 - clone: find the current branch more explicitly
 - connect.c::read_extra_info(): find where HEAD points at
 - connect.c::read_extra_info(): prepare to receive more than server
   capabilities
 - get_remote_heads(): refactor code to read "server capabilities"

An attempt to extend the fetch protocol to make the logic to detect where
HEAD on the origin site points to more robust.  Will drop shortly as the
protocol extension was not very popular.

 - bisect: add "--no-replace" option to bisect without using replace
   refs

   history
 - Documentation: add "git bisect replace" documentation
 - bisect: add test cases for "git bisect replace"
 - bisect: add "git bisect replace" subcommand

Will drop and replace it with the resubmitted series when it comes.

 - "git push": tellme-more protocol extension

This seems to have a deadlock during communication between the peers.
Will drop shortly.

* jk/renamelimit (Sat May 3 13:58:42 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 - diff: enable "too large a rename" warning when -M/-C is explicitly
   asked for

This would be the right thing to do for command line use,
but gitk will be hit due to tcl/tk's limitation, so I am holding
this back for now.

* jc/stripspace (Sun Mar 9 00:30:35 2008 -0800) 6 commits
 - git-am --forge: add Signed-off-by: line for the author
 - git-am: clean-up Signed-off-by: lines
