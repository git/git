What's cooking in git.git (Jan 2009, #03; Wed, 14)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed
with '-' are only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are
in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of the branches,
but I am still holding onto them.

The topics list the commits in reverse chronological order.  The topics
meant to be merged to the maintenance series have "maint-" in their names.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* kb/am-directory (Sun Jan 11 22:21:48 2009 -0800) 1 commit
 + git-am: add --directory=<dir> option

This is "third-time-lucky, perhaps?" resurrection.  I do not think I'd be
using this very often, but it originated from a real user request.

* jk/signal-cleanup (Sun Jan 11 06:36:49 2009 -0500) 3 commits
 - pager: do wait_for_pager on signal death
 - refactor signal handling for cleanup functions
 - chain kill signals for cleanup functions

* kb/lstat-cache (Tue Jan 13 13:29:08 2009 +0100) 5 commits
 - lstat_cache(): introduce clear_lstat_cache() function
 - lstat_cache(): introduce invalidate_lstat_cache() function
 - lstat_cache(): introduce has_dirs_only_path() function
 - lstat_cache(): introduce has_symlink_or_noent_leading_path()
   function
 - lstat_cache(): more cache effective symlink/directory detection

This is the seventh round; although the author asked me not to bother, I
couldn't resist.  I renamed one helper function while reading the patches
and made minor adjustments on styles, but it looked reasonable.

* lh/submodule-tree-traversal (Mon Jan 12 00:45:55 2009 +0100) 3 commits
 - builtin-ls-tree: enable traversal of submodules
 - archive.c: enable traversal of submodules
 - tree.c: add support for traversal of submodules

* jc/maint-format-patch-o-relative (Mon Jan 12 15:18:02 2009 -0800) 1 commit
 - Teach format-patch to handle output directory relative to cwd

This was my lunchtime "this may fix it" response to a breakage report.  I
haven't really thought things through but my gut feeling is this might
break things for minorities who are accustomed to the existing behaviour,
especially wrt the filenames reported on the standard output.

* lt/maint-wrap-zlib (Wed Jan 7 19:54:47 2009 -0800) 1 commit
 + Wrap inflate and other zlib routines for better error reporting

Needs the "free our memory upon seeing Z_MEM_ERROR and try again" bits
extracted from Shawn's patch on top of this one.

* js/diff-color-words (Sun Jan 11 21:00:58 2009 +0100) 4 commits
 - color-words: take an optional regular expression describing words
 - color-words: refactor to allow for 0-character word boundaries
 - color-words: refactor word splitting and use ALLOC_GROW()
 - Add color_fwrite(), a function coloring each line individually

Dscho's series that was done in response to Thomas's original; two agreed
to work together on this codebase.

* db/foreign-scm (Sun Jan 11 15:12:10 2009 -0500) 3 commits
 - Support fetching from foreign VCSes
 - Add specification of git-vcs helpers
 - Add "vcs" config option in remotes

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Stalled and may need help and prodding to go forward]

* ds/uintmax-config (Mon Nov 3 09:14:28 2008 -0900) 1 commit
 . autoconf: Enable threaded delta search when pthreads are supported

I haven't heard neither positive nor negative comments from minority
platforms that might be harmed, but this feels like the right thing to do,
so perhaps the best course of action is to merge this down to 'master' and
see if anybody screams.

* jc/blame (Wed Jun 4 22:58:40 2008 -0700) 2 commits
 + blame: show "previous" information in --porcelain/--incremental
   format
 + git-blame: refactor code to emit "porcelain format" output

This gives Porcelains (like gitweb) the information on the commit _before_
the one that the final blame is laid on, which should save them one
rev-parse to dig further.  The line number in the "previous" information
may need refining, and sanity checking code for reference counting may
need to be resurrected before this can move forward.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Actively cooking]

* gb/gitweb-opml (Fri Jan 2 13:49:30 2009 +0100) 2 commits
 + gitweb: suggest name for OPML view
 + gitweb: don't use pathinfo for global actions

* ks/maint-mailinfo-folded (Mon Jan 12 15:22:11 2009 -0800) 2 commits
 - mailinfo: 'From:' header should be unfold as well
 - mailinfo: correctly handle multiline 'Subject:' header

The author seems to have more updates, but I couldn't extract them from
the e-mail.

* js/patience-diff (Thu Jan 1 17:39:37 2009 +0100) 3 commits
 + bash completions: Add the --patience option
 + Introduce the diff option '--patience'
 + Implement the patience diff algorithm

* mv/apply-parse-opt (Fri Jan 9 22:21:36 2009 -0800) 2 commits
 + Resurrect "git apply --flags -" to read from the standard input
 + parse-opt: migrate builtin-apply.

 + rebase -i: execute hook only after argument checking

Looked reasonable.

   OS X

* mh/cherry-default (Thu Jan 1 22:56:29 2009 +0100) 2 commits
 + Documentation: clarify which parameters are optional to git-cherry
 + git-cherry: make <upstream> parameter optional

Some of the above will still need to be downmerged to respective
maintenance branches after they are widely used on 'master'.
