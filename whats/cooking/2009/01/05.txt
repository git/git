What's cooking in git.git (Jan 2009, #05; Wed, 21)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones
marked with '.' do not appear in any of the branches, but I am still
holding onto them.

The topics list the commits in reverse chronological order.  The topics
meant to be merged to the maintenance series have "maint-" in their names.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* js/valgrind (Wed Jan 21 02:36:40 2009 +0100) 2 commits
 - valgrind: ignore ldso errors
 - Add valgrind support in test scripts

Dscho seems to have some updates out of discussion with Peff.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Stalled and may need help and prodding to go forward]

* jc/blame (Wed Jun 4 22:58:40 2008 -0700) 2 commits
 + blame: show "previous" information in --porcelain/--incremental
   format
 + git-blame: refactor code to emit "porcelain format" output

This gives Porcelains (like gitweb) the information on the commit _before_
the one that the final blame is laid on, which should save them one
rev-parse to dig further.  The line number in the "previous" information
may need refining, and sanity checking code for reference counting may
need to be resurrected before this can move forward.

* db/foreign-scm (Sun Jan 11 15:12:10 2009 -0500) 3 commits
 - Support fetching from foreign VCSes
 - Add specification of git-vcs helpers
 - Add "vcs" config option in remotes

The "spec" did not seem quite well cooked yet, but in the longer term I
think something like this to allow interoperating with other SCMs as if
the other end is a native git repository is a very worthy goal.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Actively cooking]

* sp/runtime-prefix (Sun Jan 18 13:00:15 2009 +0100) 7 commits
 - Windows: Revert to default paths and convert them by
   RUNTIME_PREFIX
 - Compute prefix at runtime if RUNTIME_PREFIX is set
 - Modify setup_path() to only add git_exec_path() to PATH
 - Add calls to git_extract_argv0_path() in programs that call
   git_config_*
 - git_extract_argv0_path(): Move check for valid argv0 from caller
   to callee
 - Refactor git_set_argv0_path() to git_extract_argv0_path()
 - Move computation of absolute paths from Makefile to runtime (in
   preparation for RUNTIME_PREFIX)

We should move this to 'next' soon with J6t's blessing.

* lh/submodule-tree-traversal (Mon Jan 12 00:45:55 2009 +0100) 3 commits
 + builtin-ls-tree: enable traversal of submodules
 + archive.c: enable traversal of submodules
 + tree.c: add support for traversal of submodules

I think choosing the submodules to descend into by seeing if the commit
happens to be available is a horribly broken semantics; it needs to be
fixed before this can move to 'master'.

* jk/signal-cleanup (Sun Jan 11 06:36:49 2009 -0500) 3 commits
 - pager: do wait_for_pager on signal death
 - refactor signal handling for cleanup functions
 - chain kill signals for cleanup functions

I think this can move to 'next', as Peff and J6t agreed on how to fix
things up as needed for Windows.

* ks/maint-mailinfo-folded (Tue Jan 13 01:21:04 2009 +0300) 5 commits
 - mailinfo: tests for RFC2047 examples
 - mailinfo: add explicit test for mails like '<a.u.thor@example.com>
   (A U Thor)'
 - mailinfo: more smarter removal of rfc822 comments from 'From'
 + mailinfo: 'From:' header should be unfold as well
 + mailinfo: correctly handle multiline 'Subject:' header

As far as I can see, the only remaining thing is a minor fix-up in the
"comment removal" one before we can move this fully to 'next'.

* js/notes (Tue Jan 13 20:57:16 2009 +0100) 6 commits
 + git-notes: fix printing of multi-line notes
 + notes: fix core.notesRef documentation
 + Add an expensive test for git-notes
 + Speed up git notes lookup
 + Add a script to edit/inspect notes
 + Introduce commit notes

It would be nice to hear a real world success story using the notes
mechanism before casting this design in stone.

* sc/gitweb-category (Fri Dec 12 00:45:12 2008 +0100) 3 commits
 - gitweb: Optional grouping of projects by category
 - gitweb: Split git_project_list_body in two functions
 - gitweb: Modularized git_get_project_description to be more generic

Design discussion between Jakub and Sebastien continues.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* jk/color-parse (Sat Jan 17 10:38:46 2009 -0500) 2 commits
 + expand --pretty=format color options
 + color: make it easier for non-config to parse color specs

* sb/hook-cleanup (Sat Jan 17 04:02:55 2009 +0100) 5 commits
 + run_hook(): allow more than 9 hook arguments
 + run_hook(): check the executability of the hook before filling
   argv
 + api-run-command.txt: talk about run_hook()
 + Move run_hook() from builtin-commit.c into run-command.c (libgit)
 + checkout: don't crash on file checkout before running post-
   checkout hook

 + git-am: re-fix the diag message printing
 + git-am: Make it easier to see which patch failed

* sg/maint-gitdir-in-subdir (Fri Jan 16 16:37:33 2009 +0100) 1 commit
 + Fix gitdir detection when in subdir of gitdir

This has my "don't do the fullpath if you are directly inside .git"
squashed in, so it should be much safer.

* am/maint-push-doc (Sun Jan 18 15:36:58 2009 +0100) 4 commits
 + Documentation: avoid using undefined parameters
 + Documentation: mention branches rather than heads
 + Documentation: remove a redundant elaboration
 + Documentation: git push repository can also be a remote

* lt/maint-wrap-zlib (Wed Jan 7 19:54:47 2009 -0800) 1 commit
 + Wrap inflate and other zlib routines for better error reporting

Needs the "free our memory upon seeing Z_MEM_ERROR and try again" bits
extracted from Shawn's patch on top of this one.

* kb/am-directory (Wed Jan 14 16:29:59 2009 -0800) 2 commits
 + git-am: fix shell quoting
 + git-am: add --directory=<dir> option

This is "third-time-lucky, perhaps?" resurrection.  I do not think I'd be
using this very often, but it originated from a real user request.

* jc/maint-format-patch-o-relative (Mon Jan 12 15:18:02 2009 -0800) 1 commit
 + Teach format-patch to handle output directory relative to cwd

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Will merge to "master" soon]

   function
 + lstat_cache(): more cache effective symlink/directory detection

* tr/previous-branch (Wed Jan 21 00:37:38 2009 -0800) 10 commits
 + Simplify parsing branch switching events in reflog
 + Introduce for_each_recent_reflog_ent().
