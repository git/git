What's cooking in git.git (Jan 2009, #07; Wed, 28)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones
marked with '.' do not appear in any of the branches, but I am still
holding onto them.

The topics list the commits in reverse chronological order.  The topics
meant to be merged to the maintenance series have "maint-" in their names.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* jc/maint-1.6.0-split-diff-metainfo (Mon Jan 26 00:08:24 2009 -0800) 1 commit
 + diff.c: output correct index lines for a split diff

This is slated for maintenance series 1.6.0.X, 1.6.1.X and also for
'master'.  I think the change is pretty safe and sane to go directly to
'master' but I had too many other topoics to look at that I did not feel
comfortable enough to do so.

* jc/maint-split-diff-metainfo (Tue Jan 27 01:08:02 2009 -0800) 2 commits
 + Merge branch 'jc/maint-1.6.0-split-diff-metainfo' into jc/maint-
   split-diff-metainfo
 + diff.c: output correct index lines for a split diff

Early conflict resolution branch for the above to carry it to 1.6.1X
series.

* js/maint-rebase-i-submodule (Tue Jan 27 12:42:31 2009 +0100) 2 commits
 + Fix submodule squashing into unrelated commit
 + rebase -i squashes submodule changes into unrelated commit

* jg/tag-contains (Mon Jan 26 09:13:25 2009 -0500) 3 commits
 + git-tag: Add --contains option
 + Make has_commit() non-static
 + Make opt_parse_with_commit() non-static

* jk/maint-cleanup-after-exec-failure (Wed Jan 28 02:38:14 2009 -0500) 4 commits
 + git: use run_command() to execute dashed externals
 + run_command(): help callers distinguish errors
 + run_command(): handle missing command errors more gracefully
 + git: s/run_command/run_builtin/

* jc/maint-allow-uninteresting-missing (Tue Jan 27 23:19:30 2009 -0800) 1 commit
 + revision traversal: allow UNINTERESTING objects to be missing

This is a small follow-up to the fix to send-pack in 1.6.1; meant to go in
1.6.1.X maintenance series and newer.

* am/maint-push-doc (Mon Jan 26 00:45:33 2009 +0100) 3 commits
 + Documentation: rework src/dst description in git push
 + Documentation: more git push examples
 + Documentation: simplify refspec format description

* jc/merge-convert (Mon Jan 26 16:45:01 2009 -0800) 1 commit
 - git-merge-file: allow converting the results for the work tree

We did not give scripted Porcelains a way to say "this temporary file I am
using for merging is for this path, so use the core.autocrlf and attributes
rules for that final path".  Instead, merge-file simply wrote out the
data in the canonical repository representation.

rerere has the same issue, but it is a lot worse.  It reads the three
files (preimage, postimage and thisimage) from the work tree in the work
tree representation, merges them without converting them to the canonical
representation first but inserts the conflict markers with the canonical
representation and writes the resulting mess out.  It needs to be fixed to
read with convert_to_git(), merge them while they are still in the
canonical representation and possibly add conflict markers, and then write
the results out after convert_to_working_tree().  It also needs to write
in binary mode as well.

* jc/maint-add-u-remove-conflicted (Wed Jan 28 14:24:53 2009 -0800) 1 commit
 - add -u: do not fail to resolve a path as deleted

This has been updated from the posted version with a correction.

* ns/am-slacker (Sat Jan 24 10:18:02 2009 +0900) 2 commits
 + git-am: Add --ignore-date option
 + am: Add --committer-date-is-author-date option

It is a (probably) useful new feature with a sort-of cute explanation.

* jc/maint-apply-fix (Sun Jan 25 23:41:26 2009 -0800) 1 commit
 + builtin-apply.c: do not set bogus mode in check_preimage() for
   deleted path

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Stalled and may need help and prodding to go forward]

* jc/blame (Wed Jun 4 22:58:40 2008 -0700) 2 commits
 + blame: show "previous" information in --porcelain/--incremental
   format
 + git-blame: refactor code to emit "porcelain format" output

This gives Porcelains (like gitweb) the information on the commit _before_
the one that the final blame is laid on, which should save them one
rev-parse to dig further.  The line number in the "previous" information
may need refining, and sanity checking code for reference counting may
need to be resurrected before this can move forward.

* db/foreign-scm (Sun Jan 11 15:12:10 2009 -0500) 3 commits
 - Support fetching from foreign VCSes
 - Add specification of git-vcs helpers
 - Add "vcs" config option in remotes

The "spec" did not seem quite well cooked yet, but in the longer term I
think something like this to allow interoperating with other SCMs as if
the other end is a native git repository is a very worthy goal.

* cc/replace (Fri Jan 23 10:07:46 2009 +0100) 7 commits
 - environment: add global variable to disable replacement
 - mktag: call "check_sha1_signature" with the replacement sha1
 - replace_object: add a test case
 - object: call "check_sha1_signature" with the replacement sha1
 - sha1_file: add a "read_sha1_file_repl" function
 - replace_object: add mechanism to replace objects found in
   "refs/replace/"
 - refs: add a "for_each_replace_ref" function

Nobody has review comments on this yet.

* lh/submodule-tree-traversal (Sun Jan 25 01:52:06 2009 +0100) 6 commits
 - archive.c: add support for --submodules[=(all|checkedout)]
 - tree.c: allow read_tree_recursive() to traverse gitlink entries
 + Revert round #1 of the series
 + builtin-ls-tree: enable traversal of submodules
 + archive.c: enable traversal of submodules
 + tree.c: add support for traversal of submodules

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Reverted]

* mh/unify-color (Fri Jan 23 01:25:23 2009 -0800) 3 commits
 ? Revert previous two commits
 ? move the color variables to color.c
 ? handle color.ui at a central place

This broke git-format-patch badly.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Actively cooking]

* js/valgrind (Wed Jan 21 02:36:40 2009 +0100) 2 commits
 - valgrind: ignore ldso errors
 - Add valgrind support in test scripts

Dscho and Peff had further exchanges on the list; I am sort of waiting for
the conclusion before picking any intermediate version up.

* ks/maint-mailinfo-folded (Tue Jan 13 01:21:04 2009 +0300) 4 commits
 + mailinfo: tests for RFC2047 examples
 + mailinfo: add explicit test for mails like '<a.u.thor@example.com>
   (A U Thor)'
 + mailinfo: 'From:' header should be unfold as well
 + mailinfo: correctly handle multiline 'Subject:' header

I just got tired of waiting and cleaned up the series myself.

* js/notes (Tue Jan 13 20:57:16 2009 +0100) 6 commits
 + git-notes: fix printing of multi-line notes
 + notes: fix core.notesRef documentation
 + Add an expensive test for git-notes
 + Speed up git notes lookup
 + Add a script to edit/inspect notes
 + Introduce commit notes

It would be nice to hear a real world success story using the notes
mechanism; Dscho says he also wants to make sure the current choice
of the structure scales well before casting it in stone.

* sc/gitweb-category (Fri Dec 12 00:45:12 2008 +0100) 3 commits
 - gitweb: Optional grouping of projects by category
 - gitweb: Split git_project_list_body in two functions
 - gitweb: Modularized git_get_project_description to be more generic

Design discussion between Jakub and Sebastien continues.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* sr/clone-empty (Fri Jan 23 01:07:32 2009 +0100) 1 commit
 + Allow cloning an empty repository

Has anybody actually tried this and made sure the resulting empty clone
works fine after the clone source gets updated with some contents?

 + bundle: allow the same ref to be given more than once
 + revision walker: include a detached HEAD in --all

* cb/add-pathspec (Wed Jan 14 15:54:35 2009 +0100) 2 commits
 + remove pathspec_match, use match_pathspec instead
