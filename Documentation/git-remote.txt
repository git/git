DESCRIPTION
-----------

Manage the set of repositories ("remotes") whose branches you track.


OPTIONS
-------

-v::
--verbose::
	Be a little more verbose and show remote url after name.
	NOTE: This must be placed between `remote` and `subcommand`.


COMMANDS
--------

With no arguments, shows a list of existing remotes.  Several
subcommands are available to perform operations on the remotes.

'add'::

Adds a remote named <name> for the repository at
<url>.  The command `git fetch <name>` can then be used to create and
update remote-tracking branches <name>/<branch>.
+
With `-f` option, `git fetch <name>` is run immediately after
the remote information is set up.
+
With `--tags` option, `git fetch <name>` imports every tag from the
remote repository.
+
With `--no-tags` option, `git fetch <name>` does not import tags from
the remote repository.
+
With `-t <branch>` option, instead of the default glob
refspec for the remote to track all branches under
the `refs/remotes/<name>/` namespace, a refspec to track only `<branch>`
is created.  You can give more than one `-t <branch>` to track
multiple branches without grabbing all branches.
+
With `-m <master>` option, a symbolic-ref `refs/remotes/<name>/HEAD` is set
up to point at remote's `<master>` branch. See also the set-head command.
+
When a fetch mirror is created with `--mirror=fetch`, the refs will not
be stored in the 'refs/remotes/' namespace, but rather everything in
'refs/' on the remote will be directly mirrored into 'refs/' in the
local repository. This option only makes sense in bare repositories,
because a fetch would overwrite any local commits.
+
When a push mirror is created with `--mirror=push`, then `git push`
will always behave as if `--mirror` was passed.

'rename'::

Rename the remote named <old> to <new>. All remote-tracking branches and
configuration settings for the remote are updated.
+
In case <old> and <new> are the same, and <old> is a file under
`$GIT_DIR/remotes` or `$GIT_DIR/branches`, the remote is converted to
the configuration file format.

'remove'::
'rm'::

Remove the remote named <name>. All remote-tracking branches and
configuration settings for the remote are removed.

'set-head'::

Sets or deletes the default branch (i.e. the target of the
symbolic-ref `refs/remotes/<name>/HEAD`) for
the named remote. Having a default branch for a remote is not required,
but allows the name of the remote to be specified in lieu of a specific
branch. For example, if the default branch for `origin` is set to
`master`, then `origin` may be specified wherever you would normally
specify `origin/master`.
+
With `-d` or `--delete`, the symbolic ref `refs/remotes/<name>/HEAD` is deleted.
+
With `-a` or `--auto`, the remote is queried to determine its `HEAD`, then the
symbolic-ref `refs/remotes/<name>/HEAD` is set to the same branch. e.g., if the remote
`HEAD` is pointed at `next`, "`git remote set-head origin -a`" will set
the symbolic-ref `refs/remotes/origin/HEAD` to `refs/remotes/origin/next`. This will
only work if `refs/remotes/origin/next` already exists; if not it must be
fetched first.
+
Use `<branch>` to set the symbolic-ref `refs/remotes/<name>/HEAD` explicitly. e.g., "git
remote set-head origin master" will set the symbolic-ref `refs/remotes/origin/HEAD` to
`refs/remotes/origin/master`. This will only work if
`refs/remotes/origin/master` already exists; if not it must be fetched first.
+

'set-branches'::

Changes the list of branches tracked by the named remote.
This can be used to track a subset of the available remote branches
after the initial setup for a remote.
+
The named branches will be interpreted as if specified with the
`-t` option on the 'git remote add' command line.
+
With `--add`, instead of replacing the list of currently tracked
branches, adds to that list.

'set-url'::

Changes URL remote points to. Sets first URL remote points to matching
regex <oldurl> (first URL if no <oldurl> is given) to <newurl>. If
<oldurl> doesn't match any URL, error occurs and nothing is changed.
+
With '--push', push URLs are manipulated instead of fetch URLs.
+
With '--add', instead of changing some URL, new URL is added.
+
With '--delete', instead of changing some URL, all URLs matching
regex <url> are deleted. Trying to delete all non-push URLs is an
error.

'show'::

Gives some information about the remote <name>.
+
With `-n` option, the remote heads are not queried first with
`git ls-remote <name>`; cached information is used instead.

'prune'::

Deletes all stale remote-tracking branches under <name>.
These stale branches have already been removed from the remote repository
referenced by <name>, but are still locally available in
"remotes/<name>".
+
With `--dry-run` option, report what branches will be pruned, but do not
actually prune them.

'update'::

Fetch updates for a named set of remotes in the repository as defined by
remotes.<group>.  If a named group is not specified on the command line,
the configuration parameter remotes.default will be used; if
remotes.default is not defined, all remotes which do not have the
configuration parameter remote.<name>.skipDefaultUpdate set to true will
be updated.  (See linkgit:git-config[1]).
+
With `--prune` option, prune all the remotes that are updated.


DISCUSSION
----------

The remote configuration is achieved using the `remote.origin.url` and
`remote.origin.fetch` configuration variables.  (See
linkgit:git-config[1]).

Examples
--------

* Add a new remote, fetch, and check out a branch from it
+
------------
$ git remote
origin
$ git branch -r
  origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  origin/master
$ git remote add staging git://git.kernel.org/.../gregkh/staging.git
$ git remote
origin
staging
$ git fetch staging
...
From git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/staging
 * [new branch]      master     -> staging/master
 * [new branch]      staging-linus -> staging/staging-linus
 * [new branch]      staging-next -> staging/staging-next
$ git branch -r
  origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  origin/master
  staging/master
  staging/staging-linus
  staging/staging-next
$ git checkout -b staging staging/master
...
------------

* Imitate 'git clone' but track only selected branches
+
------------
$ mkdir project.git
$ cd project.git
$ git init
$ git remote add -f -t master -m master origin git://example.com/git.git/
$ git merge origin
------------
