git-replay(1)
=============

NAME
----
git-replay - EXPERIMENTAL: Replay commits on a new base, works with bare repos too


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
(EXPERIMENTAL!) 'git replay' --onto <newbase> <revision-range>...

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Takes ranges of commits and replays them onto a new location. Leaves
the working tree and the index untouched, and updates no references.
The output of this command is meant to be used as input to
`git update-ref --stdin`, which would update the relevant branches
(see the OUTPUT section below).

THIS COMMAND IS EXPERIMENTAL. THE BEHAVIOR MAY CHANGE.

OPTIONS
-------

--onto <newbase>::
	Starting point at which to create the new commits.  May be any
	valid commit, and not just an existing branch name.
+
The update-ref command(s) in the output will update the branch(es) in
the revision range to point at the new commits, similar to the way how
`git rebase --update-refs` updates multiple branches in the affected
range.

<revision-range>::
	Range of commits to replay; see "Specifying Ranges" in
	linkgit:git-rev-parse and the "Commit Limiting" options below.

OUTPUT
------

When there are no conflicts, the output of this command is usable as
input to `git update-ref --stdin`.  It is of the form:

	update refs/heads/branch1 ${NEW_branch1_HASH} ${OLD_branch1_HASH}
	update refs/heads/branch2 ${NEW_branch2_HASH} ${OLD_branch2_HASH}
	update refs/heads/branch3 ${NEW_branch3_HASH} ${OLD_branch3_HASH}

where the number of refs updated depends on the arguments passed and
the shape of the history being replayed.

EXIT STATUS
-----------

For a successful, non-conflicted replay, the exit status is 0.  When
the replay has conflicts, the exit status is 1.  If the replay is not
able to complete (or start) due to some kind of error, the exit status
is something other than 0 or 1.

EXAMPLES
--------

To simply rebase `mybranch` onto `target`:

------------
$ git replay --onto target origin/main..mybranch
update refs/heads/mybranch ${NEW_mybranch_HASH} ${OLD_mybranch_HASH}
------------

When calling `git replay`, one does not need to specify a range of
commits to replay using the syntax `A..B`; any range expression will
do:

------------
$ git replay --onto origin/main ^base branch1 branch2 branch3
update refs/heads/branch1 ${NEW_branch1_HASH} ${OLD_branch1_HASH}
update refs/heads/branch2 ${NEW_branch2_HASH} ${OLD_branch2_HASH}
update refs/heads/branch3 ${NEW_branch3_HASH} ${OLD_branch3_HASH}
------------

This will simultaneously rebase `branch1`, `branch2`, and `branch3`,
all commits they have since `base`, playing them on top of
`origin/main`. These three branches may have commits on top of `base`
that they have in common, but that does not need to be the case.
