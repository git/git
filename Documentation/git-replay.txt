git-replay(1)
=============

NAME
----
git-replay - Replay commits on a different base, without touching working tree


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git replay' --onto <newbase> <revision-range>...

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Takes a range of commits, and replays them onto a new location.  Does
not touch the working tree or index, and does not update any
references.  However, the output of this command is meant to be used
as input to `git update-ref --stdin`, which would update the relevant
branches.

THIS COMMAND IS EXPERIMENTAL. THE BEHAVIOR MAY CHANGE.

OPTIONS
-------

--onto <newbase>::
	Starting point at which to create the new commits.  May be any
	valid commit, and not just an existing branch name.
+
The update-ref commands in the output will update the branch(es)
in the revision range to point at the new commits (in other
words, this mimics a rebase operation).

<revision-range>::
	Range of commits to replay; see "Specifying Ranges" in
	linkgit:git-rev-parse.

OUTPUT
------

When there are no conflicts, the output of this command is usable as
input to `git update-ref --stdin`.  It is basically of the form:

	update refs/heads/branch1 ${NEW_branch1_HASH} ${OLD_branch1_HASH}
	update refs/heads/branch2 ${NEW_branch2_HASH} ${OLD_branch2_HASH}
	update refs/heads/branch3 ${NEW_branch3_HASH} ${OLD_branch3_HASH}

where the number of refs updated depend on the arguments passed.

EXIT STATUS
-----------

For a successful, non-conflicted replay, the exit status is 0.  When
the replay has conflicts, the exit status is 1.  If the replay is not
able to complete (or start) due to some kind of error, the exit status
is something other than 0 or 1.

EXAMPLES
--------

To simply rebase mybranch onto target:

------------
$ git replay --onto target origin/main..mybranch
update refs/heads/mybranch ${NEW_mybranch_HASH} ${OLD_mybranch_HASH}
------------

When calling `git replay`, one does not need to specify a range of
commits to replay using the syntax `A..B`; any range expression will
do:

------------
$ git replay --onto origin/main ^base branch1 branch2 branch3
update refs/heads/branch1 ${NEW_branch1_HASH} ${OLD_branch1_HASH}
update refs/heads/branch2 ${NEW_branch2_HASH} ${OLD_branch2_HASH}
update refs/heads/branch3 ${NEW_branch3_HASH} ${OLD_branch3_HASH}
------------

This will simultaneously rebase branch1, branch2, and branch3 -- all
commits they have since base, playing them on top of origin/main.
These three branches may have commits on top of base that they have in
common, but that does not need to be the case.
