git-get-tar-commit-id(1)
========================

NAME
----
git-get-tar-commit-id - Extract commit ID from an archive created using git-archive


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git get-tar-commit-id'


DESCRIPTION
-----------

Read a tar archive created by 'git archive' from the standard input
and extract the commit ID stored in it.  It reads only the first
1024 bytes of input, thus its runtime is not influenced by the size
of the tar archive very much.

If no commit ID is found, 'git get-tar-commit-id' quietly exists with a
return code of 1.  This can happen if the archive had not been created
using 'git archive' or if the first parameter of 'git archive' had been
a tree ID instead of a commit ID or tag.
