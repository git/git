git-cherry-pick(1)
==================

NAME
----
git-cherry-pick - Apply the changes introduced by some existing commits

SYNOPSIS
--------
'git cherry-pick' [--edit] [-n] [-m parent-number] [-s] [-x] [--ff] <commit>...

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Given one or more existing commits, apply the change each one
introduces, recording a new commit for each.  This requires your
working tree to be clean (no modifications from the HEAD commit).

OPTIONS
-------
<commit>...::
	Commits to cherry-pick.
	For a more complete list of ways to spell commits, see
	linkgit:gitrevisions[1].
	Sets of commits can be passed but no traversal is done by
	default, as if the '--no-walk' option was specified, see
	linkgit:git-rev-list[1].

-e::
--edit::
	With this option, 'git cherry-pick' will let you edit the commit
	message prior to committing.

-x::
	When recording the commit, append to the original commit
	message a note that indicates which commit this change
	was cherry-picked from.  Append the note only for cherry
	picks without conflicts.  Do not use this option if
	you are cherry-picking from your private branch because
	the information is useless to the recipient.  If on the
	other hand you are cherry-picking between two publicly
	visible branches (e.g. backporting a fix to a
	maintenance branch for an older release from a
	development branch), adding this information can be
	useful.

-r::
	It used to be that the command defaulted to do `-x`
	described above, and `-r` was to disable it.  Now the
	default is not to do `-x` so this option is a no-op.

-m parent-number::
--mainline parent-number::
	Usually you cannot cherry-pick a merge because you do not know which
	side of the merge should be considered the mainline.  This
	option specifies the parent number (starting from 1) of
	the mainline and allows cherry-pick to replay the change
	relative to the specified parent.

-n::
--no-commit::
	Usually the command automatically creates a sequence of commits.
	This flag applies the changes necessary to cherry-pick
	each named commit to your working tree and the index,
	without making any commit.  In addition, when this
	option is used, your index does not have to match the
	HEAD commit.  The cherry-pick is done against the
	beginning state of your index.
+
This is useful when cherry-picking more than one commits'
effect to your index in a row.

-s::
--signoff::
	Add Signed-off-by line at the end of the commit message.

--ff::
	If the current HEAD is the same as the parent of the
	cherry-pick'ed commit, then a fast forward to this commit will
	be performed.

EXAMPLES
--------
git cherry-pick master::

	Apply the change introduced by the commit at the tip of the
	master branch and create a new commit with this change.

git cherry-pick ..master::
git cherry-pick ^HEAD master::

	Apply the changes introduced by all commits that are ancestors
	of master but not of HEAD to produce new commits.

git cherry-pick master\~4 master~2::

	Apply the changes introduced by the fifth and third last
	commits pointed to by master and create 2 new commits with
	these changes.

git cherry-pick -n master~1 next::

	Apply to the working tree and the index the changes introduced
	by the second last commit pointed to by master and by the last
	commit pointed to by next, but do not create any commit with
	these changes.

git cherry-pick --ff ..next::

	If history is linear and HEAD is an ancestor of next, update
	the working tree and advance the HEAD pointer to match next.
	Otherwise, apply the changes introduced by those commits that
	are in next but not HEAD to the current branch, creating a new
	commit for each new change.

git rev-list --reverse master \-- README | git cherry-pick -n --stdin::

	Apply the changes introduced by all commits on the master
	branch that touched README to the working tree and index,
	so the result can be inspected and made into a single new
	commit if suitable.
