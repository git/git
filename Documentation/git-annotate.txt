SYNOPSIS
--------
'git annotate' [options] file [revision]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Annotates each line in the given file with information from the commit
which introduced the line. Optionally annotates from a given revision.

The only difference between this command and linkgit:git-blame[1] is that
they use slightly different output formats, and this command exists only
for backward compatibility to support existing scripts, and provide a more
familiar command name for people coming from other SCM systems.
