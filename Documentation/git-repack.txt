git-repack - Pack unpacked objects in a repository


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git repack' [-a] [-A] [-d] [-f] [-F] [-l] [-n] [-q] [-b] [-m]
	[--window=<n>] [--depth=<n>] [--threads=<n>] [--keep-pack=<pack-name>]
	[--write-midx] [--full-name-hash] [--path-walk]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

This command is used to combine all objects that do not currently
reside in a "pack", into a pack.  It can also be used to re-organize
existing packs into a single, more efficient pack.

A pack is a collection of objects, individually compressed, with
delta compression applied, stored in a single file, with an
associated index file.

Packs are used to reduce the load on mirror systems, backup
engines, disk storage, etc.

OPTIONS
-------

-a::
	Instead of incrementally packing the unpacked objects,
	pack everything referenced into a single pack.
	Especially useful when packing a repository that is used
	for private development. Use
	with `-d`.  This will clean up the objects that `git prune`
	leaves behind, but `git fsck --full --dangling` shows as
	dangling.
+
Note that users fetching over dumb protocols will have to fetch the
whole new pack in order to get any contained object, no matter how many
other objects in that pack they already have locally.
+
Promisor packfiles are repacked separately: if there are packfiles that
have an associated ".promisor" file, these packfiles will be repacked
into another separate pack, and an empty ".promisor" file corresponding
to the new separate pack will be written.

-A::
	Same as `-a`, unless `-d` is used.  Then any unreachable
	objects in a previous pack become loose, unpacked objects,
	instead of being left in the old pack.  Unreachable objects
	are never intentionally added to a pack, even when repacking.
	This option prevents unreachable objects from being immediately
	deleted by way of being left in the old pack and then
	removed.  Instead, the loose unreachable objects
	will be pruned according to normal expiry rules
	with the next 'git gc' invocation. See linkgit:git-gc[1].

-d::
	After packing, if the newly created packs make some
	existing packs redundant, remove the redundant packs.
	Also run  'git prune-packed' to remove redundant
	loose object files.

--cruft::
	Same as `-a`, unless `-d` is used. Then any unreachable objects
	are packed into a separate cruft pack. Unreachable objects can
	be pruned using the normal expiry rules with the next `git gc`
	invocation (see linkgit:git-gc[1]). Incompatible with `-k`.

--cruft-expiration=<approxidate>::
	Expire unreachable objects older than `<approxidate>`
	immediately instead of waiting for the next `git gc` invocation.
	Only useful with `--cruft -d`.

--max-cruft-size=<n>::
	Repack cruft objects into packs as large as `<n>` bytes before
	creating new packs. As long as there are enough cruft packs
	smaller than `<n>`, repacking will cause a new cruft pack to
	be created containing objects from any combined cruft packs,
	along with any new unreachable objects. Cruft packs larger than
	`<n>` will not be modified. When the new cruft pack is larger
	than `<n>` bytes, it will be split into multiple packs, all of
	which are guaranteed to be at most `<n>` bytes in size. Only
	useful with `--cruft -d`.

--expire-to=<dir>::
	Write a cruft pack containing pruned objects (if any) to the
	directory `<dir>`. This option is useful for keeping a copy of
	any pruned objects in a separate directory as a backup. Only
	useful with `--cruft -d`.

-l::
	Pass the `--local` option to 'git pack-objects'. See
	linkgit:git-pack-objects[1].

-f::
	Pass the `--no-reuse-delta` option to `git-pack-objects`, see
	linkgit:git-pack-objects[1].

-F::
	Pass the `--no-reuse-object` option to `git-pack-objects`, see
	linkgit:git-pack-objects[1].

-q::
--quiet::
	Show no progress over the standard error stream and pass the `-q`
	option to 'git pack-objects'. See linkgit:git-pack-objects[1].

-n::
	Do not update the server information with
	'git update-server-info'.  This option skips
	updating local catalog files needed to publish
	this repository (or a direct copy of it)
	over HTTP or FTP.  See linkgit:git-update-server-info[1].

--window=<n>::
--depth=<n>::
	These two options affect how the objects contained in the pack are
	stored using delta compression. The objects are first internally
	sorted by type, size and optionally names and compared against the
	other objects within `--window` to see if using delta compression saves
	space. `--depth` limits the maximum delta depth; making it too deep
	affects the performance on the unpacker side, because delta data needs
	to be applied that many times to get to the necessary object.
+
The default value for --window is 10 and --depth is 50. The maximum
depth is 4095.

--threads=<n>::
	This option is passed through to `git pack-objects`.

--window-memory=<n>::
	This option provides an additional limit on top of `--window`;
	the window size will dynamically scale down so as to not take
	up more than '<n>' bytes in memory.  This is useful in
	repositories with a mix of large and small objects to not run
	out of memory with a large window, but still be able to take
	advantage of the large window for the smaller objects.  The
	size can be suffixed with "k", "m", or "g".
	`--window-memory=0` makes memory usage unlimited.  The default
	is taken from the `pack.windowMemory` configuration variable.
	Note that the actual memory usage will be the limit multiplied
	by the number of threads used by linkgit:git-pack-objects[1].

--max-pack-size=<n>::
	Maximum size of each output pack file. The size can be suffixed with
	"k", "m", or "g". The minimum size allowed is limited to 1 MiB.
	If specified, multiple packfiles may be created, which also
	prevents the creation of a bitmap index.
	The default is unlimited, unless the config variable
	`pack.packSizeLimit` is set. Note that this option may result in
	a larger and slower repository; see the discussion in
	`pack.packSizeLimit`.

--filter=<filter-spec>::
	Remove objects matching the filter specification from the
	resulting packfile and put them into a separate packfile. Note
	that objects used in the working directory are not filtered
	out. So for the split to fully work, it's best to perform it
	in a bare repo and to use the `-a` and `-d` options along with
	this option.  Also `--no-write-bitmap-index` (or the
	`repack.writebitmaps` config option set to `false`) should be
	used otherwise writing bitmap index will fail, as it supposes
	a single packfile containing all the objects. See
	linkgit:git-rev-list[1] for valid `<filter-spec>` forms.

--filter-to=<dir>::
	Write the pack containing filtered out objects to the
	directory `<dir>`. Only useful with `--filter`. This can be
	used for putting the pack on a separate object directory that
	is accessed through the Git alternates mechanism. **WARNING:**
	If the packfile containing the filtered out objects is not
	accessible, the repo can become corrupt as it might not be
	possible to access the objects in that packfile. See the
	`objects` and `objects/info/alternates` sections of
	linkgit:gitrepository-layout[5].

-b::
--write-bitmap-index::
	Write a reachability bitmap index as part of the repack. This
	only makes sense when used with `-a`, `-A` or `-m`, as the bitmaps
	must be able to refer to all reachable objects. This option
	overrides the setting of `repack.writeBitmaps`. This option
	has no effect if multiple packfiles are created, unless writing a
	MIDX (in which case a multi-pack bitmap is created).

--pack-kept-objects::
	Include objects in `.keep` files when repacking.  Note that we
	still do not delete `.keep` packs after `pack-objects` finishes.
	This means that we may duplicate objects, but this makes the
	option safe to use when there are concurrent pushes or fetches.
	This option is generally only useful if you are writing bitmaps
	with `-b` or `repack.writeBitmaps`, as it ensures that the
	bitmapped packfile has the necessary objects.

--keep-pack=<pack-name>::
	Exclude the given pack from repacking. This is the equivalent
	of having `.keep` file on the pack. `<pack-name>` is the
	pack file name without leading directory (e.g. `pack-123.pack`).
	The option can be specified multiple times to keep multiple
	packs.

--unpack-unreachable=<when>::
	When loosening unreachable objects, do not bother loosening any
	objects older than `<when>`. This can be used to optimize out
	the write of any objects that would be immediately pruned by
	a follow-up `git prune`.

-k::
--keep-unreachable::
	When used with `-ad`, any unreachable objects from existing
	packs will be appended to the end of the packfile instead of
	being removed. In addition, any unreachable loose objects will
	be packed (and their loose counterparts removed).

-i::
--delta-islands::
	Pass the `--delta-islands` option to `git-pack-objects`, see
	linkgit:git-pack-objects[1].

-g<factor>::
--geometric=<factor>::
	Arrange resulting pack structure so that each successive pack
	contains at least `<factor>` times the number of objects as the
	next-largest pack.
+
`git repack` ensures this by determining a "cut" of packfiles that need
to be repacked into one in order to ensure a geometric progression. It
picks the smallest set of packfiles such that as many of the larger
packfiles (by count of objects contained in that pack) may be left
intact.
+
Unlike other repack modes, the set of objects to pack is determined
uniquely by the set of packs being "rolled-up"; in other words, the
packs determined to need to be combined in order to restore a geometric
progression.
+
Loose objects are implicitly included in this "roll-up", without respect to
their reachability. This is subject to change in the future.
+
When writing a multi-pack bitmap, `git repack` selects the largest resulting
pack as the preferred pack for object selection by the MIDX (see
linkgit:git-multi-pack-index[1]).

-m::
--write-midx::
	Write a multi-pack index (see linkgit:git-multi-pack-index[1])
	containing the non-redundant packs.

--path-walk::
	This option passes the `--path-walk` option to the underlying
	`git pack-options` process (see linkgit:git-pack-objects[1]).
	By default, `git pack-objects` walks objects in an order that
	presents trees and blobs in an order unrelated to the path they
	appear relative to a commit's root tree. The `--path-walk` option
	enables a different walking algorithm that organizes trees and
	blobs by path. This has the potential to improve delta compression
	especially in the presence of filenames that cause collisions in
	Git's default name-hash algorithm. Due to changing how the objects
	are walked, this option is not compatible with `--delta-islands`
	or `--filter`.

CONFIGURATION
-------------

Various configuration variables affect packing, see
linkgit:git-config[1] (search for "pack" and "delta").

By default, the command passes `--delta-base-offset` option to
'git pack-objects'; this typically results in slightly smaller packs,
but the generated packs are incompatible with versions of Git older than
version 1.4.4. If you need to share your repository with such ancient Git
versions, either directly or via the dumb http protocol, then you
need to set the configuration variable `repack.UseDeltaBaseOffset` to
"false" and repack. Access from old Git versions over the native protocol
is unaffected by this option as the conversion is performed on the fly
as needed in that case.

Delta compression is not used on objects larger than the
`core.bigFileThreshold` configuration variable and on files with the
attribute `delta` set to false.
