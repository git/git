Git Release Notes
=================

Backward Compatibility Notes
----------------------------

 * "git branch -l <foo>" used to be a way to ask a reflog to be
   created while creating a new branch, but that is no longer the
   case.  It is a short-hand for "git branch --list <foo>" now.

 * "git push" into refs/tags/* hierarchy is rejected without getting
   forced, but "git fetch" (misguidedly) used the "fast forwarding"
   rule used for the refs/heads/* hierarchy; this has been corrected,
   which means some fetches of tags that did not fail with older
   version of Git will fail without "--force" with this version.


Updates since v2.19
-------------------

UI, Workflows & Features

 * Running "git clone" against a project that contain two files with
   pathnames that differ only in cases on a case insensitive
   filesystem would result in one of the files lost because the
   underlying filesystem is incapable of holding both at the same
   time.  An attempt is made to detect such a case and warn.

 * "git checkout -b newbranch [HEAD]" should not have to do as much as
   checking out a commit different from HEAD.  An attempt is made to
   optimize this special case.

 * "git rev-list --stdin </dev/null" used to be an error; it now shows
   no output without an error.  "git rev-list --stdin --default HEAD"
   still falls back to the given default when nothing is given on the
   standard input.

 * Lift code from GitHub to restrict delta computation so that an
   object that exists in one fork is not made into a delta against
   another object that does not appear in the same forked repository.

 * "git format-patch" learned new "--interdiff" and "--range-diff"
   options to explain the difference between this version and the
   previous attempt in the cover letter (or after the tree-dashes as
   a comment).

 * "git mailinfo" used in "git am" learned to make a best-effort
   recovery of a patch corrupted by MUA that sends text/plain with
   format=flawed option.
   (merge 3aa4d81f88 rs/mailinfo-format-flowed later to maint).

 * The rules used by "git push" and "git fetch" to determine if a ref
   can or cannot be updated were inconsistent; specifically, fetching
   to update existing tags were allowed even though tags are supposed
   to be unmoving anchoring points.  "git fetch" was taught to forbid
   updates to existing tags without the "--force" option.

 * "git multi-pack-index" learned to detect corruption in the .midx
   file it uses, and this feature has been integrated into "git fsck".

 * Generation of (experimental) commit-graph files have so far been
   fairly silent, even though it takes noticeable amount of time in a
   meaningfully large repository.  The users will now see progress
   output.

 * The minimum version of Windows supported by Windows port fo Git is
   now set to Vista.

 * The completion script (in contrib/) learned to complete a handful of
   options "git stash list" command takes.


Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.

 * When there are too many packfiles in a repository (which is not
   recommended), looking up an object in these would require
   consulting many pack .idx files; a new mechanism to have a single
   file that consolidates all of these .idx files is introduced.

 * "git submodule update" is getting rewritten piece-by-piece into C.

 * The code for computing history reachability has been shuffled,
   obtained a bunch of new tests to cover them, and then being
   improved.

 * The unpack_trees() API used in checking out a branch and merging
   walks one or more trees along with the index.  When the cache-tree
   in the index tells us that we are walking a tree whose flattened
   contents is known (i.e. matches a span in the index), as linearly
   scanning a span in the index is much more efficient than having to
   open tree objects recursively and listing their entries, the walk
   can be optimized, which has been done.

 * When creating a thin pack, which allows objects to be made into a
   delta against another object that is not in the resulting pack but
   is known to be present on the receiving end, the code learned to
   take advantage of the reachability bitmap; this allows the server
   to send a delta against a base beyond the "boundary" commit.

 * spatch transformation to replace boolean uses of !hashcmp() to
   newly introduced oideq() is added, and applied, to regain
   performance lost due to support of multiple hash algorithms.

 * Fix a bug in which the same path could be registered under multiple
   worktree entries if the path was missing (for instance, was removed
   manually).  Also, as a convenience, expand the number of cases in
   which --force is applicable.

 * Split Documentation/config.txt for easier maintenance.
   (merge 6014363f0b nd/config-split later to maint).

 * Test helper binaries clean-up.
   (merge c9a1f4161f nd/test-tool later to maint).

 * Various tests have been updated to make it easier to swap the
   hash function used for object identification.
   (merge ae0c89d41b bc/hash-independent-tests later to maint).

 * Update fsck.skipList implementation and documentation.
   (merge 371a655074 ab/fsck-skiplist later to maint).

 * An alias that expands to another alias has so far been forbidden,
   but now it is allowed to create such an alias.

 * Various test scripts have been updated for style and also correct
   handling of exit status of various commands.

 * "gc --auto" ended up calling exit(-1) upon error, which has been
   corrected to use exit(1).  Also the error reporting behaviour when
   daemonized has been updated to exit with zero status when stopping
   due to a previously discovered error (which implies there is no
   point running gc to improve the situation); we used to exit with
   failure in such a case.


Fixes since v2.19
-----------------

 * "git interpret-trailers" and its underlying machinery had a buggy
   code that attempted to ignore patch text after commit log message,
   which triggered in various codepaths that will always get the log
   message alone and never get such an input.
   (merge 66e83d9b41 jk/trailer-fixes later to maint).

 * Malformed or crafted data in packstream can make our code attempt
   to read or write past the allocated buffer and abort, instead of
   reporting an error, which has been fixed.

 * "git rebase -i" did not clear the state files correctly when a run
   of "squash/fixup" is aborted and then the user manually amended the
   commit instead, which has been corrected.
   (merge 10d2f35436 js/rebase-i-autosquash-fix later to maint).

 * When fsmonitor is in use, after operation on submodules updates
   .gitmodules, we lost track of the fact that we did so and relied on
   stale fsmonitor data.
   (merge 43f1180814 bp/mv-submodules-with-fsmonitor later to maint).

 * Fix for a long-standing bug that leaves the index file corrupt when
   it shrinks during a partial commit.
   (merge 6c003d6ffb jk/reopen-tempfile-truncate later to maint).

 * Further fix for O_APPEND emulation on Windows
   (merge eeaf7ddac7 js/mingw-o-append later to maint).

 * A corner case bugfix in "git rerere" code.
   (merge ad2bf0d9b4 en/rerere-multi-stage-1-fix later to maint).

 * "git add ':(attr:foo)'" is not supported and is supposed to be
   rejected while the command line arguments are parsed, but we fail
   to reject such a command line upfront.
   (merge 84d938b732 nd/attr-pathspec-fix later to maint).

 * Recent update broke the reachability algorithm when refs (e.g.
   tags) that point at objects that are not commit were involved,
   which has been fixed.

 * "git rebase" etc. in Git 2.19 fails to abort when given an empty
   commit log message as result of editing, which has been corrected.
   (merge a3ec9eaf38 en/sequencer-empty-edit-result-aborts later to maint).

 * The code to backfill objects in lazily cloned repository did not
   work correctly, which has been corrected.
   (merge e68302011c jt/lazy-object-fetch-fix later to maint).

 * Update error messages given by "git remote" and make them consistent.
   (merge 5025425dff ms/remote-error-message-update later to maint).

 * "git update-ref" learned to make both "--no-deref" and "--stdin"
   work at the same time.
   (merge d345e9fbe7 en/update-ref-no-deref-stdin later to maint).

 * Recently added "range-diff" had a corner-case bug to cause it
   segfault, which has been corrected.
   (merge e467a90c7a tg/range-diff-corner-case-fix later to maint).

 * The recently introduced commit-graph auxiliary data is incompatible
   with mechanisms such as replace & grafts that "breaks" immutable
   nature of the object reference relationship.  Disable optimizations
   based on its use (and updating existing commit-graph) when these
   incompatible features are in use in the repository.
   (merge 829a321569 ds/commit-graph-with-grafts later to maint).

 * The mailmap file update.
   (merge 255eb03edf jn/mailmap-update later to maint).

 * The code in "git status" sometimes hit an assertion failure.  This
   was caused by a structure that was reused without cleaning the data
   used for the first run, which has been corrected.
   (merge 3e73cc62c0 en/status-multiple-renames-to-the-same-target-fix later to maint).

 * Code cleanup, docfix, build fix, etc.
   (merge 96a7501aad ts/doc-build-manpage-xsl-quietly later to maint).
