Git v1.8.0.2 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.8.0.1
--------------------

 * Various codepaths have workaround for a common misconfiguration to
   spell "UTF-8" as "utf8", but it was not used uniformly.  Most
   notably, mailinfo (which is used by "git am") lacked this support.

 * We failed to mention a file without any content change but whose
   permission bit was modified, or (worse yet) a new file without any
   content in the "git diff --stat" output.

 * When "--stat-count" hides a diffstat for binary contents, the total
   number of added and removed lines at the bottom was computed
   incorrectly.

 * When "--stat-count" hides a diffstat for unmerged paths, the total
   number of affected files at the bottom of the "diff --stat" output
   was computed incorrectly.

 * "diff --shortstat" miscounted the total number of affected files
   when there were unmerged paths.

 * "git p4" used to try expanding malformed "$keyword$" that spans
   across multiple lines.

 * "git update-ref -d --deref SYM" to delete a ref through a symbolic
   ref that points to it did not remove it correctly.

 * Syntax highlighting in "gitweb" was not quite working.

Also contains other minor fixes and documentation updates.
