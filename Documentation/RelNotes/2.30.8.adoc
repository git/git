Git v2.30.8 Release Notes
=========================

This release addresses the security issues CVE-2023-22490 and
CVE-2023-23946.


Fixes since v2.30.7
-------------------

 * CVE-2023-22490:

   Using a specially-crafted repository, Git can be tricked into using
   its local clone optimization even when using a non-local transport.
   Though Git will abort local clones whose source $GIT_DIR/objects
   directory contains symbolic links (c.f., CVE-2022-39253), the objects
   directory itself may still be a symbolic link.

   These two may be combined to include arbitrary files based on known
   paths on the victim's filesystem within the malicious repository's
   working copy, allowing for data exfiltration in a similar manner as
   CVE-2022-39253.

 * CVE-2023-23946:

   By feeding a crafted input to "git apply", a path outside the
   working tree can be overwritten as the user who is running "git
   apply".

 * A mismatched type in `attr.c::read_attr_from_index()` which could
   cause Git to errantly reject attributes on Windows and 32-bit Linux
   has been corrected.
