Git v2.4.3 Release Notes
========================

Fixes since v2.4.3
------------------

 * Error messages from "git branch" called remote-tracking branches as
   "remote branches".

 * "git rerere forget" in a repository without rerere enabled gave a
   cryptic error message; it should be a silent no-op instead.

 * "git pull --log" and "git pull --no-log" worked as expected, but
   "git pull --log=20" did not.

 * The pull.ff configuration was supposed to override the merge.ff
   configuration, but it didn't.

 * The code to read pack-bitmap wanted to allocate a few hundred
   pointers to a structure, but by mistake allocated and leaked memory
   enough to hold that many actual structures.  Correct the allocation
   size and also have it on stack, as it is small enough.

 * Various documentation mark-up fixes to make the output more
   consistent in general and also make AsciiDoctor (an alternative
   formatter) happier.

 * "git bundle verify" did not diagnose extra parameters on the
   command line.

 * Multi-ref transaction support we merged a few releases ago
   unnecessarily kept many file descriptors open, risking to fail with
   resource exhaustion.

 * The ref API did not handle cases where 'refs/heads/xyzzy/frotz' is
   removed at the same time as 'refs/heads/xyzzy' is added (or vice
   versa) very well.

 * The "log --decorate" enhancement in Git 2.4 that shows the commit
   at the tip of the current branch e.g. "HEAD -> master", did not
   work with --decorate=full.

 * There was a commented-out (instead of being marked to expect
   failure) test that documented a breakage that was fixed since the
   test was written; turn it into a proper test.

 * core.excludesfile (defaulting to $XDG_HOME/git/ignore) is supposed
   to be overridden by repository-specific .git/info/exclude file, but
   the order was swapped from the beginning. This belatedly fixes it.

 * The connection initiation code for "ssh" transport tried to absorb
   differences between the stock "ssh" and Putty-supplied "plink" and
   its derivatives, but the logic to tell that we are using "plink"
   variants were too loose and falsely triggered when "plink" appeared
   anywhere in the path (e.g. "/home/me/bin/uplink/ssh").

 * "git rebase -i" moved the "current" command from "todo" to "done" a
   bit too prematurely, losing a step when a "pick" did not even start.

 * "git add -e" did not allow the user to abort the operation by
   killing the editor.

 * Git 2.4 broke setting verbosity and progress levels on "git clone"
   with native transports.

 * Some time ago, "git blame" (incorrectly) lost the convert_to_git()
   call when synthesizing a fake "tip" commit that represents the
   state in the working tree, which broke folks who record the history
   with LF line ending to make their project portable across
   platforms while terminating lines in their working tree files with
   CRLF for their platform.

 * Code clean-up for xdg configuration path support.

Also contains typofixes, documentation updates and trivial code
clean-ups.
