Git v1.7.10 Release Notes
=========================

Updates since v1.7.9
--------------------

UI, Workflows & Features

 * Improved handling of views, labels and branches in git-p4 (in contrib).

 * "git-p4" (in contrib) suffered from unnecessary merge conflicts when
   p4 expanded the embedded $RCS$-like keywords; it can be now told to
   unexpand them.

 * Some "git-svn" updates.

 * "vcs-svn"/"svn-fe" learned to read dumps with svn-deltas and
   support incremental imports.

 * The configuration mechanism learned an "include" facility; an
   assignment to the include.path pseudo-variable causes the named
   file to be included in-place when Git looks up configuration
   variables.

 * "git am" learned to pass "-b" option to underlying "git mailinfo", so
   that bracketed string other than "PATCH" at the beginning can be kept.

 * "git clone" learned "--single-branch" option to limit cloning to a
   single branch (surprise!).

 * "git clone" learned to detach the HEAD in the resulting repository
   when the source repository's HEAD does not point to a branch.

 * When showing a patch while ignoring whitespace changes, the context
   lines are taken from the postimage, in order to make it easier to
   view the output.

 * "diff-highlight" filter (in contrib/) was updated to produce more
   aesthetically pleasing output.

 * "git tag --list" can be given "--points-at <object>" to limit its
   output to those that point at the given object.

 * "git merge" in an interactive session learned to spawn the editor
   by default to let the user edit the auto-generated merge message,
   to encourage people to explain their merges better. Legacy scripts
   can export MERGE_AUTOEDIT=no to retain the historical behaviour.
   Both "git merge" and "git pull" can be given --no-edit from the
   command line to accept the auto-generated merge message.

 * "gitweb" allows intermediate entries in the directory hierarchy
   that leads to a projects to be clicked, which in turn shows the
   list of projects inside that directory.

Performance

 * During "git upload-pack" in respose to "git fetch", unnecessary calls
   to parse_object() have been eliminated, to help performance in
   repositories with excessive number of refs.

Internal Implementation (please report possible regressions)

 * Recursive call chains in "git index-pack" to deal with long delta
   chains have been flattened, to reduce the stack footprint.

 * Use of add_extra_ref() API is now gone, to make it possible to
   cleanly restructure the overall refs API.

 * The command line parser of "git pack-objects" now uses parse-options
   API.

 * The test suite supports the new "test_pause" helper function.

 * Parallel to the test suite, there is a beginning of performance
   benchmarking framework.

 * t/Makefile is adjusted to prevent newer versions of GNU make from
   running tests in seemingly random order.

Also contains minor documentation updates and code clean-ups.


Fixes since v1.7.9
------------------

Unless otherwise noted, all the fixes since v1.7.9 in the maintenance
releases are contained in this release (see release notes to them for
details).

 * "gitweb" used to drop warnings in the log file when "heads" view is
   accessed in a repository whose HEAD does not point at a valid
   branch.
