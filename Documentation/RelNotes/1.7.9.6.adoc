Git v1.7.9.6 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.7.9.5
--------------------

 * "git merge $tag" to merge an annotated tag always opens the editor
   during an interactive edit session. v1.7.10 series introduced an
   environment variable GIT_MERGE_AUTOEDIT to help older scripts decline
   this behaviour, but the maintenance track should also support it.

Also contains minor fixes and documentation updates.
