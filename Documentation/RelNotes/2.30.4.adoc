Git v2.30.4 Release Notes
=========================

This release contains minor fix-ups for the changes that went into
Git 2.30.3, which was made to address CVE-2022-24765.

 * The code that was meant to parse the new `safe.directory`
   configuration variable was not checking what configuration
   variable was being fed to it, which has been corrected.

 * '*' can be used as the value for the `safe.directory` variable to
   signal that the user considers that any directory is safe.
