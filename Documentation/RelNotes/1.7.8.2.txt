Git v1.7.8.2 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.7.8.1
--------------------

 * Porcelain commands like "but reset" did not distinguish deletions
   and type-changes from ordinary modification, and reported them with
   the same 'M' moniker. They now use 'D' (for deletion) and 'T' (for
   type-change) to match "but status -s" and "but diff --name-status".

 * The configuration file parser used for sizes (e.g. bigFileThreshold)
   did not correctly interpret 'g' suffix.

 * The replacement implementation for snprintf used on platforms with
   native snprintf that is broken did not use va_copy correctly.

 * LF-to-CRLF streaming filter replaced all LF with CRLF, which might
   be technically correct but not friendly to people who are trying
   to recover from earlier mistakes of using CRLF in the repository
   data in the first place. It now refrains from doing so for LF that
   follows a CR.

 * but native connection going over TCP (not over SSH) did not set
   SO_KEEPALIVE option which failed to receive link layer errors.

 * "but branch -m <current branch> HEAD" is an obvious no-op but was not
   allowed.

 * "but checkout -m" did not recreate the conflicted state in a "both
   sides added, without any common ancestor version" conflict
   situation.

 * "but cherry-pick $cummit" (not a range) created an unnecessary
   sequencer state and interfered with valid workflow to use the
   command during a session to cherry-pick multiple cummits.

 * You could make "but cummit" segfault by giving the "--no-message"
   option.

 * "fast-import" did not correctly update an existing notes tree,
   possibly corrupting the fan-out.

 * "but fetch-pack" accepted unqualified refs that do not begin with
   refs/ by mistake and compensated it by matching the refspec with
   tail-match, which was doubly wrong. This broke fetching from a
   repository with a funny named ref "refs/foo/refs/heads/master" and a
   'master' branch with "but fetch-pack refs/heads/master", as the
   command incorrectly considered the former a "match".

 * "but log --follow" did not honor the rename threshold score given
   with the -M option (e.g. "-M50%").

 * "but mv" gave suboptimal error/warning messages when it overwrites
   target files. It also did not pay attention to "-v" option.

 * Authenticated "but push" over dumb HTTP were broken with a recent
   change and failed without asking for password when username is
   given.

 * "but push" to an empty repository over HTTP were broken with a
   recent change to the ref handling.

 * "but push -v" forgot how to be verbose by mistake. It now properly
   becomes verbose when asked to.

 * When a "reword" action in "but rebase -i" failed to run "cummit --amend",
   we did not give the control back to the user to resolve the situation, and
   instead kept the original cummit log message.

Also contains minor fixes and documentation updates.
