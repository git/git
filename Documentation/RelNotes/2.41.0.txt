Git v2.41 Release Notes
=======================

UI, Workflows & Features

 * Allow information carried on the WWW-AUthenticate header to be
   passed to the credential helpers.

 * A new "fetch.hideRefs" option can be used to exclude specified refs
   from "rev-list --objects --stdin --not --all" traversal for
   checking object connectivity, most useful when there are many
   unrelated histories in a single repository.

 * "git push" has been taught to allow deletion of refs with one-level
   names to help repairing a repository who acquired such a ref by
   mistake.  In general, we don't encourage use of such a ref, and
   creation or update to such a ref is rejected as before.

 * Allow "git bisect reset" to check out the original branch when the
   branch is already checked out in a different worktree linked to the
   same repository.

 * A few subcommands have been taught to stop users from working on a
   branch that is being used in another worktree linked to the same
   repository.

 * "git format-patch" learned to write a log-message only output file
   for empty commits.

 * "git format-patch" honors the src/dst prefixes set to nonstandard
   values with configuration variables like "diff.noprefix", causing
   receiving end of the patch that expects the standard -p1 format to
   break.  "format-patch" has been taught to ignore end-user configuration
   and always use the standard prefixes.

   This is a backward compatibility breaking change.

 * Lift the limitation that colored prompts can only be used with
   PROMPT_COMMAND mode.

 * "git blame --contents=<file> <rev> -- <path>" used to be forbidden,
   but now it finds the origins of lines starting at <file> contents
   through the history that leads to <rev>.

 * "git pack-redundant" gave a warning when run, as the command has
   outlived its usefulness long ago and is nominated for future
   removal.  Now we escalate to give an error.

Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.

 * Code clean-up to clarify directory traversal API.

 * Code clean-up to clarify the rule that "git-compat-util.h" must be
   the first to be included.

 * More work towards -Wunused.

 * Instead of forcing each command to choose to honor GPG related
   configuration variables, make the subsystem lazily initialize
   itself.

 * Remove workaround for ancient versions of DocBook to make it work
   correctly with groff, which has not been necessary since docbook
   1.76 from 2010.

 * Code clean-up to include and/or uninclude parse-options.h file as
   needed.


Fixes since v2.40
-----------------

 * "git fsck" learned to check the index files in other worktrees,
   just like "git gc" honors them as anchoring points.
   (merge 8d3e7eac52 jk/fsck-indices-in-worktrees later to maint).

 * Fix a segfaulting loop.  The function and its caller may need
   further clean-up.
   (merge c5773dc078 ew/commit-reach-clean-up-flags-fix later to maint).

 * "git restore" supports options like "--ours" that are only
   meaningful during a conflicted merge, but these options are only
   meaningful when updating the working tree files.  These options are
   marked to be incompatible when both "--staged" and "--worktree" are
   in effect.
   (merge ee8a88826a ak/restore-both-incompatible-with-conflicts later to maint).

 * Simplify UI to control progress meter given by "git bundle" command.
   (merge 8b95521edb jk/bundle-progress later to maint).

 * "git bundle" learned that "-" is a common way to say that the input
   comes from the standard input and/or the output goes to the
   standard output.  It used to work only for output and only from the
   root level of the working tree.
   (merge 0bbe10313e jk/bundle-use-dash-for-stdfiles later to maint).

 * Once we start running, we assumed that the list of alternate object
   databases would never change.  Hook into the machinery used to
   update the list of packfiles during runtime to update this list as
   well.
   (merge e2d003dbed ds/reprepare-alternates-when-repreparing-packfiles later to maint).

 * The code to parse "git rebase -X<opt>" was not prepared to see an
   unparsable option string, which has been corrected.
   (merge 15a4cc912e ab/fix-strategy-opts-parsing later to maint).

 * "git add -p" while the index is unmerged sometimes failed to parse
   the diff output it internally produces and died, which has been
   corrected.
   (merge 28d1122f9c jk/add-p-unmerged-fix later to maint).

 * Fix for a "ls-files --format="%(path)" that produced nonsense
   output, which was a bug in 2.38.
   (merge cfb62dd006 aj/ls-files-format-fix later to maint).

 * "git receive-pack" that responds to "git push" requests failed to
   clean a stale lockfile when killed in the middle, which has been
   corrected.
   (merge c55c30669c ps/receive-pack-unlock-before-die later to maint).

 * "git rev-parse --quiet foo@{u}", or anything that asks @{u} to be
   parsed with GET_OID_QUIETLY option, did not quietly fail, which has
   been corrected.
   (merge dfbfdc521d fc/oid-quietly-parse-upstream later to maint).

 * Transports that do not support protocol v2 did not correctly fall
   back to protocol v0 under certain conditions, which has been
   corrected.
   (merge eaa0fd6584 jk/fix-proto-downgrade-to-v0 later to maint).

 * time(2) on glib 2.31+, especially on Linux, goes out of sync with
   higher resolution timers used for gettimeofday(2) and by the
   filesystem.  Replace all calls to it with a git_time() wrapper and
   (merge 370ddcbc89 pe/time-use-gettimeofday later to maint).

 * Code clean-up to use designated initializers in parse-options API.
   (merge 353e6d4554 sg/parse-options-h-initializers later to maint).

 * A recent-ish change to allow unicode character classes to be used
   with "grep -P" triggered a JIT bug in older pcre2 libraries.
   The problematic change in Git built with these older libraries has
   been disabled to work around the bug.
   (merge 14b9a04479 mk/workaround-pcre-jit-ucp-bug later to maint).

 * The wildmatch library code unlearns exponential behaviour it
   acquired some time ago since it was borrowed from rsync.
   (merge 3dc0b7f0dc pw/wildmatch-fixes later to maint).

 * The index files can become corrupt under certain conditions when
   the split-index feature is in use, especially together with
   fsmonitor, which have been corrected.
   (merge 061dd722dc js/split-index-fixes later to maint).

 * Document what the pathname-looking strings in "rev-list --object"
   output are for and what they mean.
   (merge 15364d2a3c jk/document-rev-list-object-name later to maint).

 * Other code cleanup, docfix, build fix, etc.
   (merge f7111175df as/doc-markup-fix later to maint).
   (merge 90ff7c9898 fc/test-aggregation-clean-up later to maint).
   (merge 9b0c7f308a jc/am-doc-refer-to-format-patch later to maint).
