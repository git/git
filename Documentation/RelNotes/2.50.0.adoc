Git v2.50 Release Notes
=======================

UI, Workflows & Features
------------------------

 * A post-processing filter for "diff --raw" output has been
   introduced.

 * "git repack" learned "--combine-cruft-below-size" option that
   controls how cruft-packs are combined.

 * TCP keepalive behaviour on http transports can now be configured by
   calling cURL library.

 * Incrementally updating multi-pack index files.

 * "git reflog" learns "drop" subcommand, that discards the entire
   reflog data for a ref.

 * A new userdiff driver for ".ini" format configuration files has
   been added.

 * The job to coalesce loose objects into packfiles in "git
   maintenance" now has configurable batch size.

 * "git clone" still gave the message about the default branch name;
   this message has been turned into an advice message that can be
   turned off.

 * "git rev-list" learns machine-parsable output format that delimits
   each field with NUL.

 * "git maintenance" learns a new task to expire reflog entries.

 * Auth-related (and unrelated) error handling in send-email has been
   made more robust.

 * Updating multiple references have only been possible in all-or-none
   fashion with transactions, but it can be more efficient to batch
   multiple updates even when some of them are allowed to fail in a
   best-effort manner.  A new "best effort batches of updates" mode
   has been introduced.

 * "git help --build-options" reports SHA-1 and SHA-256 backends used
   in the build.

 * "git cat-file --batch" and friends learned to allow "--filter=" to
   omit certain objects, just like the transport layer does.

 * "git blame --porcelain" mode now talks about unblamable lines and
   lines that are blamed to an ignored commit.

 * The build procedure installs bash (but not zsh) completion script.


Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.
--------------------------------------------------------------

 * A handful of built-in command implementations have been rewritten
   to use the repository instance supplied by git.c:run_builtin(), its
   caller.

 * "git fsck" becomes more careful when checking the refs.

 * "git fast-export | git fast-import" learns to deal with commit and
   tag objects with embedded signatures a bit better.

 * The code paths to check whether a refname X is available (by seeing
   if another ref X/Y exists, etc.) have been optimized.

 * First step of deprecating and removing merge-recursive.

 * In protocol v2 where the refs advertisement is constrained, we try
   to tell the server side not to limit the advertisement when there
   is no specific need to, which has been the source of confusion and
   recent bugs.  Revamp the logic to simplify.

 * Update meson based build procedure for breaking changes support.

 * Enable -Wunreachable-code for developer builds.

 * Ensure what we write in assert() does not have side effects,
   and introduce ASSERT() macro to mark those that cannot be
   mechanically checked for lack of side effects.

 * Give more meaningful error return values from block writer layer of
   the reftable ref-API backend.

 * Make the code in reftable library less reliant on the service
   routines it used to borrow from Git proper, to make it easier to
   use by external users of the library.

 * CI update.

 * The object layer has been updated to take an explicit repository
   instance as a parameter in more code paths.

 * Some warnings from "-Wsign-compare" for builtin/rm.c have been
   squelched.

 * A few traditional unit tests have been rewritten to use the clar
   framework.

 * Some warnings from "-Wsign-compare" for pathspec.c have been
   squelched.

 * "make test" used to have a hard dependency on (basic) Perl; tests
   have been rewritten help environment with NO_PERL test the build as
   much as possible.

 * Remove remnants of the recursive merge strategy backend, which was
   superseded by the ort merge strategy.

 * Optimize the code to dedup references recorded in a bundle file.

 * Update parse-options API to catch mistakes to pass address of an
   integral variable of a wrong type/size.

 * Since a call to repo_config() can be called with repo set to NULL
   these days, a command that is marked as RUN_SETUP in the builtin
   command table does not have to check repo with NULL before making
   the call.

 * Overhaul of the reftable API.

 * Reduce requirement for Perl in our documentation build and a few
   scripts.


Fixes since v2.49
-----------------

 * The refname exclusion logic in the packed-ref backend has been
   broken for some time, which confused upload-pack to advertise
   different set of refs.  This has been corrected.
   (merge 10e8a9352b tb/refs-exclude-fixes later to maint).

 * The merge-recursive and merge-ort machinery crashed in corner cases
   when certain renames are involved.
   (merge 3adba40858 en/merge-process-renames-crash-fix later to maint).

 * Certain "cruft" objects would have never been refreshed when there
   are multiple cruft packs in the repository, which has been
   corrected.
   (merge 08f612ba70 tb/multi-cruft-pack-refresh-fix later to maint).

 * The xdiff code on 32-bit platform misbehaved when an insanely large
   context size is given, which has been corrected.
   (merge d39e28e68c rs/xdiff-context-length-fix later to maint).

 * GitHub Actions CI switched on a CI/CD variable that does not exist
   when choosing what packages to install etc., which has been
   corrected.
   (merge ee89f7c79d kn/ci-meson-check-build-docs-fix later to maint).

 * Using "git name-rev --stdin" as an example, improve the framework to
   prepare tests to pretend to be in the future where the breaking
   changes have already happened.
   (merge de3dec1187 jc/name-rev-stdin later to maint).

 * An earlier code refactoring of the hash machinery missed a few
   required calls to init_fn.
   (merge d39f04b638 jh/hash-init-fixes later to maint).

 * A documentation page was left out from formatting and installation,
   which has been corrected.
   (merge ae85116f18 pw/build-breaking-changes-doc later to maint).

 * The bash command line completion script (in contrib/) has been
   updated to cope with remote repository nicknames with slashes in
   them.
   (merge 778d2f1760 dm/completion-remote-names-fix later to maint).

 * "Dubious ownership" checks on Windows has been tightened up.
   (merge 5bb88e89ef js/mingw-admins-are-special later to maint).

 * Fix lockfile contention in reftable code on Windows.
   (merge 0a3dceabf1 ps/mingw-creat-excl-fix later to maint).

 * "git-merge-file" documentation source, which has lines that look
   like conflict markers, lacked custom conflict marker size defined,
   which has been corrected..
   (merge d3b5832381 pw/custom-conflict-marker-size-for-merge-related-docs later to maint).

 * Squelch false-positive from sparse.
   (merge da87b58014 dd/sparse-glibc-workaround later to maint).

 * Adjust to the deprecation of use of Ubuntu 20.04 GitHub Actions CI.
   (merge 832d9f6d0b js/ci-github-update-ubuntu later to maint).

 * Work around CI breakage due to fedora base image getting updated.
   (merge 8a471a663b js/ci-fedora-gawk later to maint).

   (merge b9fadeead7 jt/ref-transaction-abort-fix later to maint).

 * Random build fixes.
   (merge 85e1d6819f ps/misc-build-fixes later to maint).

 * "git fetch [<remote>]" with only the configured fetch refspec
   should be the only thing to update refs/remotes/<remote>/HEAD,
   but the code was overly eager to do so in other cases.

 * Incorrect sorting of refs with bytes with high-bit set on platforms

   hooksPath configuration variable to /dev/nulll
   (merge 1b2eee94f1 ds/doc-disable-hooks later to maint).
