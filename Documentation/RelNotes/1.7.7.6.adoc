Git v1.7.7.6 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.7.7.5
--------------------

 * The code to look up attributes for paths reused entries from a wrong
   directory when two paths in question are in adjacent directories and
   the name of the one directory is a prefix of the other.

 * A wildcard that matches deeper hierarchy given to the "diff-index" command,
   e.g. "git diff-index HEAD -- '*.txt'", incorrectly reported additions of
   matching files even when there is no change.

 * When producing a "thin pack" (primarily used in bundles and smart
   HTTP transfers) out of a fully packed repository, we unnecessarily
   avoided sending recent objects as a delta against objects we know
   the other side has.

Also contains minor fixes and documentation updates.
