Git v2.48 Release Notes
=======================

UI, Workflows & Features
------------------------

 * A new configuration variable remote.<name>.serverOption makes the
   transport layer act as if the --serverOption=<value> option is
   given from the command line.

 * "git rebase --rebase-merges" now uses branch names as labels when
   able.

 * Describe the policy to introduce breaking changes.

 * Teach 'git notes add' and 'git notes append' a new '-e' flag,
   instructing them to open the note in $GIT_EDITOR before saving.


Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.
--------------------------------------------------------------

 * Document "amlog" notes.
   (merge ddfb5bcfc6 tb/notes-amlog-doc later to maint).

 * The way AsciiDoc is used for SYNOPSIS part of the manual pages has
   been revamped.  The sources, at least for the simple cases, got
   vastly pleasant to work with.

 * The reftable library is now prepared to expect that the memory
   allocation function given to it may fail to allocate and to deal
   with such an error.

 * An extra worktree attached to a repository points at each other to
   allow finding the repository from the worktree and vice versa
   possible.  Turn this linkage to relative paths.

 * Enable Windows-based CI in GitLab.

 * Commands that can also work outside Git have learned to take the
   repository instance "repo" when we know we are in a repository, and
   NULL when we are not, in a parameter.  The uses of the_repository
   variable in a few of them have been removed using the new calling
   convention.

 * The reftable sub-system grew a new reftable-specific strbuf
   replacement to reduce its dependency on Git-specific data
   structures.

 * The ref-filter machinery learns to recognize and avoid cases where
   sorting would be redundant.

 * Various platform compatibility fixes split out of the larger effort
   to use Meson as the primary build tool.

 * Treat ECONNABORTED the same as ECONNRESET in 'git credential-cache'
   to work around a possible Cygwin regression. This resolves a race
   condition caused by changes in Cygwin's handling of socket
   closures, allowing the client to exit cleanly when encountering
   ECONNABORTED.

 * Demonstrate an assertion failure in 'git mv'.

 * Documentation update to clarify that 'uploadpack.allowAnySHA1InWant'
   implies both 'allowTipSHA1InWant' and 'allowReachableSHA1InWant'.

 * Replace various calls to atoi() with strtol_i() and strtoul_ui(),
   and add improved error handling.

 * Documentation updates to 'git-update-ref(1)'.

 * Update the project's CodingGuidelines to discourage naming functions
   with a "_1()" suffix.

 * Updates the '.clang-format' to match project conventions.

 * Centralize documentation for repository extensions into a single place.

 * Buildfix and upgrade of Clar to a newer version.

 * Documentation mark-up updates.

 * Renaming a handful of variables and structure fields.


Fixes since v2.47
-----------------

 * Doc update to clarify how periodical maintenance are scheduled,
   spread across time to avoid thundering hurds.
   (merge 3d6ab4177d sk/doc-maintenance-schedule later to maint).

 * Use after free and double freeing at the end in "git log -L... -p"
   had been identified and fixed.

 * On macOS, fsmonitor can fall into a race condition that results in
   a client waiting forever to be notified for an event that have
   already happened.  This problem has been corrected.

 * "git maintenance start" crashed due to an uninitialized variable
   reference, which has been corrected.

 * Fail gracefully instead of crashing when attempting to write the
   contents of a corrupt in-core index as a tree object.

 * A "git fetch" from the superproject going down to a submodule used
   a wrong remote when the default remote names are set differently
   between them.

 * Fixes compile time warnings with 64-bit MSVC.

 * Teaches 'shortlog' to explicitly use SHA-1 when operating outside
   of a repository.

 * Fix 'git grep' regression on macOS by disabling lookahead when
   encountering invalid UTF-8 byte sequences.

 * The dumb-http code regressed when the result of re-indexing a pack
   yielded an *.idx file that differs in content from the *.idx file
   it downloaded from the remote. This has been corrected by no longer
   relying on: the *.idx file we got from the remote.

 * When called with '--left-right' and '--use-bitmap-index', 'rev-list'
   will produce output without any left/right markers, which has been
   corrected.

 * More leakfixes.

 * Test modernization.

 * The "--shallow-exclude=<ref>" option to various history transfer
   commands takes a ref, not an arbitrary revision.

 * A regression where commit objects missing from a commit-graph can
   cause an infinite loop when doing a fetch in a partial clone has
   been fixed.

 * The MinGW compatibility layer has been taught to support POSIX
   semantics for atomic renames when other process(es) have a file
   opened at the destination path.

 * "git gc" discards any objects that are outside promisor packs that
   are referred to by an object in a promisor pack, and we do not
   refetch them from the promisor at runtime, resulting an unusable
   repository.  Work it around by including these objects in the
   referring promisor pack at the receiving end of the fetch.

 * Avoid build/test breakage on a system without working malloc debug
   support dynamic library.
   (merge 72ad6dc368 jk/test-malloc-debug-check later to maint).

 * Double-free fix.
   (merge fe17a25905 jk/fetch-prefetch-double-free-fix later to maint).

 * Use of some uninitialized variables in "git difftool" has been
   corrected.

 * Object reuse code based on multi-pack-index sent an unwanted copy
   of object.
   (merge e199290592 tb/multi-pack-reuse-dupfix later to maint).

 * Other code cleanup, docfix, build fix, etc.
   (merge 1164e270b5 jk/output-prefix-cleanup later to maint).
   (merge f36b8cbaef jh/config-unset-doc-fix later to maint).
