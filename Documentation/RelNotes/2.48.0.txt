Git v2.48 Release Notes
=======================

UI, Workflows & Features
------------------------

 * A new configuration variable remote.<name>.serverOption makes the
   transport layer act as if the --serverOption=<value> option is
   given from the command line.

 * "git rebase --rebase-merges" now uses branch names as labels when
   able.

Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.
--------------------------------------------------------------

 * Document "amlog" notes.
   (merge ddfb5bcfc6 tb/notes-amlog-doc later to maint).

 * The way AsciiDoc is used for SYNOPSIS part of the manual pages has
   been revamped.  The sources, at least for the simple cases, got
   vastly pleasant to work with.

 * The reftable library is now prepared to expect that the memory
   allocation function given to it may fail to allocate and to deal
   with such an error.

 * An extra worktree attached to a repository points at each other to
   allow finding the repository from the worktree and vice versa
   possible.  Turn this linkage to relative paths.

   spread across time to avoid thundering hurds.
