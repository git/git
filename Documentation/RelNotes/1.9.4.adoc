Git v1.9.4 Release Notes
========================

Fixes since v1.9.3
------------------

 * Commands that take pathspecs on the command line misbehaved when
   the pathspec is given as an absolute pathname (which is a
   practice not particularly encouraged) that points at a symbolic
   link in the working tree.

 * An earlier fix to the shell prompt script (in contrib/) for using
   the PROMPT_COMMAND interface did not correctly check if the extra
   code path needs to trigger, causing the branch name not to appear
   when 'promptvars' option is disabled in bash or PROMPT_SUBST is
   unset in zsh.
