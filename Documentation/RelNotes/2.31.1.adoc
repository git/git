Git 2.31.1 Release Notes
========================

Fixes since v2.31
-----------------

 * The fsmonitor interface read from its input without making sure
   there is something to read from.  This bug is new in 2.31
   timeframe.

 * The data structure used by fsmonitor interface was not properly
   duplicated during an in-core merge, leading to use-after-free etc.

 * "git bisect" reimplemented more in C during 2.30 timeframe did not
   take an annotated tag as a good/bad endpoint well.  This regression
   has been corrected.

 * Fix macros that can silently inject unintended null-statements.

 * CALLOC_ARRAY() macro replaces many uses of xcalloc().

 * Update insn in Makefile comments to run fuzz-all target.

 * Fix a corner case bug in "git mv" on case insensitive systems,
   which was introduced in 2.29 timeframe.
