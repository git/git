Git v2.20.2 Release Notes
=========================

This release merges up the fixes that appear in v2.14.6, v2.15.4
and in v2.17.3, addressing the security issues CVE-2019-1348,
CVE-2019-1349, CVE-2019-1350, CVE-2019-1351, CVE-2019-1352,
CVE-2019-1353, CVE-2019-1354, and CVE-2019-1387; see the release notes
for those versions for details.

The change to disallow `submodule.<name>.update=!command` entries in
`.gitmodules` which was introduced v2.15.4 (and for which v2.17.3
added explicit fsck checks) fixes the vulnerability in v2.20.x where a
recursive clone followed by a submodule update could execute code
contained within the repository without the user explicitly having
asked for that (CVE-2019-19604).

Credit for finding this vulnerability goes to Joern Schneeweisz,
credit for the fixes goes to Jonathan Nieder.
