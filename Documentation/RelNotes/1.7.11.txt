Git v1.7.11 Release Notes
=========================

Updates since v1.7.10
---------------------

UI, Workflows & Features

 * A third-party tool "git subtree" is distributed in contrib/

 * Error messages given when @{u} is used for a branch without its
   upstream configured have been clatified.

 * Even with "-q"uiet option, "checkout" used to report setting up
   tracking.  Also "branch" learned the "-q"uiet option to squelch
   informational message.

 * The smart-http backend used to always override GIT_COMMITTER_*
   variables with REMOTE_USER and REMOTE_ADDR, but these variables are
   now preserved when set.

 * "git am" learned the "--include" option, which is an opposite of
   existing the "--exclude" option.

 * When "git am -3" needs to fall back to an application to a
   synthesized preimage followed by a 3-way merge, the paths that
   needed such treatment are now reported to the end user, so that the
   result in them can be eyeballed with extra care.

 * The "fmt-merge-msg" command learns to list the primary contributors
   involved in the side topic you are merging.

 * The cases "git push" fails due to non-ff can be broken into three
   categories; each case is given a separate advise message.

 * "git push --recurse-submodules" learned to optionally look into the
   histories of submodules bound to the superproject and push them
   out.

 * A 'snapshot' request to "gitweb" honors If-Modified-Since: header,
   based on the commit date.

 * "gitweb" learned to highlight the patch it outputs even more.

Foreign Interface

 * "git svn" used to die with unwanted SIGPIPE when talking with HTTP
   server that uses keep-alive.

 * "git p4" has been moved out of contrib/ area.

Performance

 * "git apply" had some memory leaks plugged.

 * Setting up a revision traversal with many starting points was
   inefficient as these were placed in a date-order priority queue
   one-by-one.  Now they are collected in the queue unordered first,
   and sorted immediately before getting used.

Internal Implementation (please report possible regressions)

 * "git rev-parse --show-prefix" used to emit nothing when run at the
   top-level of the working tree, but now it gives a blank line.

 * Minor memory leak during unpack_trees (hence "merge" and "checkout"
   to check out another branch) has been plugged.

 * More lower-level commands learned to use the streaming API to read
   from the object store without keeping everything in core.

 * Because "sh" on the user's PATH may be utterly broken on some
   systems, run-command API now uses SHELL_PATH, not /bin/sh, when
   spawning an external command (not applicable to Windows port).

 * The API to iterate over refs/ hierarchy has been tweaked to allow
   walking only a subset of it more efficiently.

Also contains minor documentation updates and code clean-ups.


Fixes since v1.7.10
-------------------

Unless otherwise noted, all the fixes since v1.7.10 in the maintenance
releases are contained in this release (see release notes to them for
details).

 * Octopus merge strategy did not reduce heads that are recorded in the
   final commit correctly.
   (merge 5802f81 jc/merge-reduce-parents-early later to maint).

 * In the older days, the header "Conflicts:" in "cherry-pick" and
   "merge" was separated by a blank line from the list of paths that
   follow for readability, but when "merge" was rewritten in C, we lost
   it by mistake. Remove the newline from "cherry-pick" to make them
   match again.
   (merge 5112068 rt/cherry-revert-conflict-summary later to maint).

 * The filesystem boundary was not correctly reported when .git
   directory discovery stopped at a mount point.
   (merge 2565b43 cb/maint-report-mount-point-correctly-in-setup later to maint).

 * The command line parser choked "git cherry-pick $name" when $name
   can be both revision name and a pathname, even though $name can
   never be a path in the context of the command.
   (merge 6d5b93f cb/cherry-pick-rev-path-confusion later to maint).

 * HTTP transport that requires authentication did not work correctly
   when multiple connections are used simultaneously.
   (merge 6f4c347 cb/http-multi-curl-auth later to maint).

 * The i18n of error message "git stash save" was not properly done.
   (merge ed3c400 rl/maint-stash-i18n-save-error later to maint).

 * The report from "git fetch" said "new branch" even for a non branch
   ref.
   (merge 0997ada mb/fetch-call-a-non-branch-a-ref later to maint).

 * The "diff --no-index" codepath used limited-length buffers, risking
   pathnames getting truncated.  Update it to use the strbuf API.
   (merge 875b91b jm/maint-strncpy-diff-no-index later to maint).

 * The parser in "fast-import" did not diagnose ":9" style references
   that is not followed by required SP/LF as an error.
   (merge 06454cb pw/fast-import-dataref-parsing later to maint).

 * When "git fetch" encounters repositories with too many references,
   the command line of "fetch-pack" that is run by a helper
   e.g. remote-curl, may fail to hold all of them. Now such an
   internal invocation can feed the references through the standard
   input of "fetch-pack".
   (merge 7103d25 it/fetch-pack-many-refs later to maint).

 * "git fetch" that recurses into submodules on demand did not check
   if it needs to go into submodules when non branches (most notably,
   tags) are fetched.
   (merge a6801ad jl/maint-submodule-recurse-fetch later to maint).

 * "git blame" started missing quite a few changes from the origin
   since we stopped using the diff minimalization by default in v1.7.2
   era.
   (merge 059a500 jc/maint-blame-minimal later to maint).

 * "log -p --graph" used with "--stat" had a few formatting error.
   (merge e2c5966 lp/maint-diff-three-dash-with-graph later to maint).

 * Giving "--continue" to a conflicted "rebase -i" session skipped a
   commit that only results in changes to submodules.
   (merge a6754cd jk/rebase-i-submodule-conflict-only later to maint).
