Git v1.9.3 Release Notes
========================

Fixes since v1.9.2
------------------

 * "git p4" dealing with changes in binary files were broken by a
   change in 1.9 release.

 * The shell prompt script (in contrib/), when using the PROMPT_COMMAND
   interface, used an unsafe construct when showing the branch name in
   $PS1.

 * "git rebase" used a POSIX shell construct FreeBSD /bin/sh does not
   work well with.

 * Some more Unicode codepoints defined in Unicode 6.3 as having
   zero width have been taught to our display column counting logic.

 * Some tests used shell constructs that did not work well on
   FreeBSD.
