Git v1.7.7.4 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.7.7.3
--------------------

 * A few header dependencies were missing from the Makefile.

 * Some newer parts of the code used C99 __VA_ARGS__ while we still
   try to cater to older compilers.

 * "git name-rev --all" tried to name all _objects_, naturally failing to
   describe many blobs and trees, instead of showing only commits as
   advertised in its documentation.
