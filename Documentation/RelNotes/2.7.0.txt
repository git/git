Git 2.7 Release Notes
=====================

Updates since v2.6
------------------

UI, Workflows & Features

 * "git remote" learned "get-url" subcommand to show the URL for a
   given remote name used for fetching and pushing.

 * There was no way to defeat a configured rebase.autostash variable
   from the command line, as "git rebase --no-autostash" was missing.

 * "git log --date=local" used to only show the normal (default)
   format in the local timezone.  The command learned to take 'local'
   as an instruction to use the local timezone with other formats,

 * The refs used during a "git bisect" session is now per-worktree so
   that independent bisect sessions can be done in different worktrees
   created with "git worktree add".

 * Users who are too busy to type three extra keystrokes to ask for
   "git stash show -p" can now set stash.showPatch configuration
   varible to true to always see the actual patch, not just the list
   of paths affected with feel for the extent of damage via diffstat.

 * "quiltimport" allows to specify the series file by honoring the
   $QUILT_SERIES environment and also --series command line option.

 * The use of 'good/bad' in "git bisect" made it confusing to use when
   hunting for a state change that is not a regression (e.g. bugfix).
   The command learned 'old/new' and then allows the end user to
   say e.g. "bisect start --term-old=fast --term=new=slow" to find a
   performance regression.

 * "git interpret-trailers" can now run outside of a Git repository.

 * "git p4" learned to reencode the pathname it uses to communicate
   with the p4 depot with a new option.

 * Give progress meter to "git filter-branch".

 * Allow a later "!/abc/def" to override an earlier "/abc" that
   appears in the same .gitignore file to make it easier to express
   "everything in /abc directory is ignored, except for ...".


Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.

 * The infrastructure to rewrite "git submodule" in C is being built
   incrementally.  Let's polish these early parts well enough and make
   them graduate to 'next' and 'master', so that the more involved
   follow-up can start cooking on a solid ground.

 * Some features from "git tag -l" and "git branch -l" have been made
   available to "git for-each-ref" so that eventually the unified
   implementation can be shared across all three.

 * Because "test_when_finished" in our test framework queues the
   clean-up tasks to be done in a shell variable, it should not be
   used inside a subshell.  Add a mechanism to allow 'bash' to catch
   such uses, and fix the ones that were found.
   (merge 0968f12 jk/test-lint-forbid-when-finished-in-subshell later to maint).

 * The debugging infrastructure for pkt-line based communication has
   been improved to mark the side-band communication specifically.
   (merge fd89433 jk/async-pkt-line later to maint).


Also contains various documentation updates and code clean-ups.


Fixes since v2.6
----------------

Unless otherwise noted, all the fixes since v2.6 in the maintenance
track are contained in this release (see the maintenance releases'
notes for details).

 * Very small number of options take a parameter that is optional
   (which is not a great UI element as they can only appear at the end
   of the command line).  Add notice to documentation of each and
   every one of them.
   (merge 2b594bf mm/keyid-docs later to maint).

 * "git blame --first-parent v1.0..v2.0" was not rejected but did not
   limit the blame to commits on the first parent chain.
   (merge 95a4fb0 jk/blame-first-parent later to maint).

 * "git subtree" (in contrib/) now can take whitespaces in the
   pathnames, not only in the in-tree pathname but the name of the
   directory that the repository is in.  (merge 5b6ab38
   as/subtree-with-spaces later to maint).

 * The ssh transport, just like any other transport over the network,
   did not clear GIT_* environment variables, but it is possible to
   use SendEnv and AcceptEnv to leak them to the remote invocation of
   Git, which is not a good idea at all.  Explicitly clear them just
   like we do for the local transport.
   (merge a48b409 jk/connect-clear-env later to maint).

 * Correct "git p4 --detect-labels" so that it does not fail to create
   a tag that points at a commit that is also being imported.
   (merge b43702a ld/p4-import-labels later to maint).

 * The Makefile always runs the library archiver with hardcoded "crs"
   options, which was inconvenient for exotic platforms on which
   people want to use programs with totally different set of command
   line options.
   (merge ac179b4 jw/make-arflags-customizable later to maint).

 * Customization to change the behaviour with "make -w" and "make -s"
   in our Makefile was broken when they were used together.
   (merge ef49e05 jk/make-findstring-makeflags-fix later to maint).

 * Allocation related functions and stdio are unsafe things to call
   inside a signal handler, and indeed killing the pager can cause
   glibc to deadlock waiting on allocation mutex as our signal handler
   tries to free() some data structures in wait_for_pager().  Reduce
   these unsafe calls.
   (merge 507d780 ti/glibc-stdio-mutex-from-signal-handler later to maint).

 * Code clean-up and minor fixes.
   (merge 15ed07d jc/rerere later to maint).
