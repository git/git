GIT v1.6.2.5 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.6.2.4
--------------------

* "git apply" mishandled if you fed a git generated patch that renames
  file A to B and file B to A at the same time.

* "git diff -c -p" (and "diff --cc") did not expect to see submodule
  differences and instead refused to work.

* "git grep -e '('" segfaulted, instead of diagnosing a mismatched
  parentheses error.

* "git fetch" generated packs with offset-delta encoding when both ends of
  the connection are capable of producing one; this cannot be read by
  ancient git and the user should be able to disable this by setting
  repack.usedeltabaseoffset configuration to false.
