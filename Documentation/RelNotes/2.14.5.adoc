Git v2.14.5 Release Notes
=========================

This release is to address the recently reported CVE-2018-17456.

Fixes since v2.14.4
-------------------

 * Submodules' "URL"s come from the untrusted .gitmodules file, but
   we blindly gave it to "git clone" to clone submodules when "git
   clone --recurse-submodules" was used to clone a project that has
   such a submodule.  The code has been hardened to reject such
   malformed URLs (e.g. one that begins with a dash).

Credit for finding and fixing this vulnerability goes to joernchen
and Jeff King, respectively.
