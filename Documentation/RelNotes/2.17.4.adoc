-------------------

 * With a crafted URL that contains a newline in it, the credential
   helper machinery can be fooled to give credential information for
   a wrong host.  The attack has been made impossible by forbidding
   a newline character in any value passed via the credential
   protocol.

Credit for finding the vulnerability goes to Felix Wilhelm of Google
