Git v2.53 Release Notes
=======================

Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.
--------------------------------------------------------------

 * The list of packfiles used in a running Git process is moved from
   the packed_git structure into the packfile store.

 * Some ref backend storage can hold not just the object name of an
   annotated tag, but the object name of the object the tag points at.
   The code to handle this information has been streamlined.
