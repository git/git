Git v2.53 Release Notes
=======================

UI, Workflows & Features
------------------------

 * "git maintenance" command learned "is-needed" subcommand to tell if
   it is necessary to perform various maintenance tasks.


Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.
--------------------------------------------------------------

 * The list of packfiles used in a running Git process is moved from
   the packed_git structure into the packfile store.

 * Some ref backend storage can hold not just the object name of an
   annotated tag, but the object name of the object the tag points at.
   The code to handle this information has been streamlined.

 * As "git diff --quiet" only cares about the existence of any
   changes, disable rename/copy detection to skip more expensive
   processing whose result will be discarded anyway.


Fixes since v2.51
-----------------

 * Ever since we added whitespace rules for this project, we misspelt
   an entry, which has been corrected.
   (merge 358e94dc70 jc/gitattributes-whitespace-no-indent-fix later to maint).
