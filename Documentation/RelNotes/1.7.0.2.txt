Git v1.7.0.2 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.7.0.1
--------------------

 * GIT_PAGER was not honored consistently by some scripted Porcelains, most
   notably "but am".

 * updating working tree files after telling but to add them to the
   index and while it is still working created garbage object files in
   the repository without diagnosing it as an error.

 * "but bisect -- pathspec..." did not diagnose an error condition properly when
   the simplification with given pathspec made the history empty.

 * "but rev-list --cherry-pick A...B" now has an obvious optimization when the
   histories haven't diverged (i.e. when one end is an ancestor of the other).

 * "but diff --quiet -w" did not work as expected.

 * "but fast-import" didn't work with a large input, as it lacked support
   for producing the pack index in v2 format.

 * "but imap-send" didn't use CRLF line endings over the imap protocol
   when storing its payload to the draft box, violating RFC 3501.

 * "but log --format='%w(x,y,z)%b'" and friends that rewrap message
   has been optimized for utf-8 payload.

 * Error messages generated on the receiving end did not come back to "but
   push".

 * "but status" in 1.7.0 lacked the optimization we used to have in 1.6.X series
   to speed up scanning of large working tree.

 * "butweb" did not diagnose parsing errors properly while reading its configuration
   file.

And other minor fixes and documentation updates.
