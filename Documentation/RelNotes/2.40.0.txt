Git v2.40 Release Notes
=======================

UI, Workflows & Features

 * "merge-tree" learns a new `--merge-base` option.

 * "git jump" (in contrib/) learned to present the "quickfix list" to
   its standard output (instead of letting it consumed by the editor
   it invokes), and learned to also drive emacs/emacsclient.

 * "git var UNKNOWN_VARIABLE" and "git var VARIABLE" with the variable
   given an empty value used to behave identically.  Now the latter
   just gives an empty output, while the former still gives an error
   message.

 * Introduce a case insensitive mode to the Bash completion helpers.

 * The advice message given by "git status" when it takes long time to
   enumerate untracked paths has been updated.

 * Just like "git var GIT_EDITOR" abstracts the complex logic to
   choose which editor gets used behind it, "git var" now give support
   to GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR.

 * "git format-patch" learned to honor format.mboxrd even when sending
   patches to the standard output stream,

 * 'cat-file' gains mailmap support for its '--batch-check' and '-s'
   options.


Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.

 * `git bisect` becomes a builtin.

 * The pack-bitmap machinery is taught to log the paths of redundant
   bitmap(s) to trace2 instead of stderr.

 * Use the SHA1DC implementation on macOS, just like other platforms,
   by default.

 * Even in a repository with promisor remote, it is useless to
   attempt to lazily attempt fetching an object that is expected to be
   commit, because no "filter" mode omits commit objects.  Take
   advantage of this assumption to fail fast on errors.

 * Stop using "git --super-prefix" and narrow the scope of its use to
   the submodule--helper.

 * Stop running win+VS build by default.
   (merge a0da6deeec js/ci-disable-cmake-by-default later to maint).

 * CI updates.  We probably want a clean-up to move the long shell
   script embedded in yaml file into a separate file, but that can
   come later.
   (merge 4542582e59 cw/ci-whitespace later to maint).

 * Use `git diff --no-index` as a test_cmp on Windows.

   We'd probably need to revisit "do we really want to, and have to,
   lose CRLF vs LF?" later, at which time we may be able to further
   clean this up by replacing "git diff --no-index" with "diff -u".


Fixes since v2.39
-----------------

 * Various leak fixes.
   (merge ac95f5d36a ab/various-leak-fixes later to maint).

 * Fix a bug where `pack-objects` would not respect multiple `--filter`
   arguments when invoked directly.
   (merge d4f7036887 rs/multi-filter-args later to maint).

 * Make fsmonitor more robust to avoid the flakiness seen in t7527.
   (merge 6692d45477 jh/t7527-unflake-by-forcing-cookie later to maint).

 * Stop using deprecated macOS API in fsmonitor.
   (merge b0226007f0 jh/fsmonitor-darwin-modernize later to maint).

 * Redefining system functions for a few functions did not follow our
   usual "implement git_foo() and #define foo(args) git_foo(args)"
   pattern, which has broken build for some folks.
   (merge e1a95b78d8 jk/avoid-redef-system-functions-2.30 later to maint).
   (merge 395bec6b39 jk/avoid-redef-system-functions later to maint).

 * The way the diff machinery prepares the options array for the
   parse_options API has been refactored to avoid resource leaks.
   (merge 189e97bc4b rs/diff-parseopts later to maint).

 * Correct pthread API usage.
   (merge 786e67611d sx/pthread-error-check-fix later to maint).

 * The code to auto-correct a misspelt subcommand unnecessarily called
   into git_default_config() from the early config codepath, which was
   a no-no.  This has bee corrected.
   (merge 0918d08887 sg/help-autocorrect-config-fix later to maint).

 * "git http-fetch" (which is rarely used) forgot to identify itself
   in the trace2 output.
   (merge 7abb43cbc8 jt/http-fetch-trace2-report-name later to maint).

 * The output from "git diff --stat" on an unmerged path lost the
   terminating LF in Git 2.39, which has been corrected.
   (merge 209d9cb011 pg/diff-stat-unmerged-regression-fix later to maint).

 * "git pull -v --recurse-submodules" attempted to pass "-v" down to
   underlying "git submodule update", which did not understand the
   request and barfed, which has been corrected.
   (merge 6f65f84766 ss/pull-v-recurse-fix later to maint).

 * When given a pattern that matches an empty string at the end of a
   line, the code to parse the "git diff" line-ranges fell into an
   infinite loop, which has been corrected.
   (merge 4e57c88e02 lk/line-range-parsing-fix later to maint).

 * Fix the sequence to fsync $GIT_DIR/packed-refs file that forgot to
   flush its output to the disk..
   (merge ce54672f9b ps/fsync-refs-fix later to maint).

 * Fix to a small regression in 2.38 days.
   (merge 6d5e9e53aa ab/bundle-wo-args later to maint).

 * Other code cleanup, docfix, build fix, etc.
