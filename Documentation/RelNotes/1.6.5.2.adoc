GIT v1.6.5.2 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.6.5.1
--------------------

 * Installation of templates triggered a bug in busybox when using tar
   implementation from it.

 * "git add -i" incorrectly ignored paths that are already in the index
   if they matched .gitignore patterns.

 * "git describe --always" should have produced some output even there
   were no tags in the repository, but it didn't.

 * "git ls-files" when showing tracked files incorrectly paid attention
   to the exclude patterns.

Other minor documentation updates are included.
