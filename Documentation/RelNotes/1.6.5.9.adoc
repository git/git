Git v1.6.5.9 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.6.5.8
--------------------

 * An overlong line after ".gitdir: " in a git file caused out of bounds
   access to an array on the stack.

 * "git blame -L $start,$end" segfaulted when too large $start was given.

 * "git rev-parse --parseopt --stop-at-non-option" did not stop at non option
   when --keep-dashdash was in effect.

 * "gitweb" can sometimes be tricked into parrotting a filename argument
   given in a request without properly quoting.

Other minor fixes and documentation updates are included.
