Git 2.47.1 Release Notes
========================

This is to flush accumulated fixes since 2.47.0 on the 'master'
front down to the maintenance track.


Fixes since Git 2.47
--------------------

 * Use after free and double freeing at the end in "git log -L... -p"
   had been identified and fixed.

 * On macOS, fsmonitor can fall into a race condition that results in
   a client waiting forever to be notified for an event that have
   already happened.  This problem has been corrected.

 * "git maintenance start" crashed due to an uninitialized variable
   reference, which has been corrected.

 * Fail gracefully instead of crashing when attempting to write the
   contents of a corrupt in-core index as a tree object.

 * A "git fetch" from the superproject going down to a submodule used
   a wrong remote when the default remote names are set differently
   between them.

 * The "gitk" project tree has been synchronized again with its new
   maintainer, Johannes Sixt.

Also contains minor documentation updates and code clean-ups.
