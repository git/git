Git v1.8.4.5 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.8.4.4
--------------------

 * Recent update to remote-hg that attempted to make it work better
   with non ASCII pathnames fed Unicode strings to the underlying Hg
   API, which was wrong.

 * "git submodule init" copied "submodule.$name.update" settings from
   .gitmodules to .git/config without making sure if the suggested
   value was sensible.
