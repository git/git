Git v2.4.6 Release Notes
========================

Fixes since v2.4.5
------------------

 * "git fetch --depth=<depth>" and "git clone --depth=<depth>" issued
   a shallow transfer request even to an upload-pack that does not
   support the capability.

 * "git fsck" used to ignore missing or invalid objects recorded in reflog.

 * The tcsh completion writes a bash scriptlet but that would have
   failed for users with noclobber set.

 * Recent Mac OS X updates breaks the logic to detect that the machine
   is on the AC power in the sample pre-auto-gc script.

 * "git format-patch --ignore-if-upstream A..B" did not like to be fed
   tags as boundary commits.

Also contains typofixes, documentation updates and trivial code
clean-ups.
