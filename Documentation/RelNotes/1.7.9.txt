Git v1.7.9 Release Notes (draft)
========================

Updates since v1.7.8
--------------------

 * gitk updates accumulated since early 2011.

 * git-gui updated to 0.16.0.

 * git-p4 (in contrib/) updates.

 * Git uses gettext to translate its most common interface messages
   into the user's language if translations are available and the
   locale is appropriately set. Distributors can drop in new PO files
   in po/ to add new translations.

 * Porcelain commands like "git reset" did not distinguish deletions
   and type-changes from ordinary modification, and reported them with
   the same 'M' moniker. They now use 'D' (for deletion) and 'T' (for
   type-change) to match "git status -s" and "git diff --name-status".

 * The code to handle username/password for HTTP transaction used in
   "git push" & "git fetch" learned to talk "credential API" to
   external programs to cache or store them, to allow integration with
   platform native keychain mechanisms.

 * The prompted input in the terminal use our own getpass() replacement
   when possible. HTTP transactions used to ask username without echoing
   back what was typed, but with this change you will see it as you type.

 * The internal of "revert/cherry-pick" has been tweaked to prepare
   building more generic "sequencer" on top of the implementation that
   drives them.

 * "git add" learned to stream large files directly into a packfile
   instead of writing them into individual loose object files.

 * "git branch -m <current branch> HEAD" is an obvious no-op and is
   now allowed.

 * "git checkout -B <current branch> <elsewhere>" is a more intuitive
   way to spell "git reset --keep <elsewhere>".

 * "git checkout" and "git merge" learned "--no-overwrite-ignore" option
   to tell Git that untracked and ignored files are not expendable.

 * "git commit --amend" learned "--no-edit" option to say that the
   user is amending the tree being recorded, without updating the
   commit log message.

 * "git commit" and "git reset" re-learned the optimization to prime
   the cache-tree information in the index, which makes it faster to
   write a tree object out after the index entries are updated.

 * "git commit" detects and rejects an attempt to stuff NUL byte in
   the commit log message.

 * fsck and prune are relatively lengthy operations that still go
   silent while making the end-user wait. They learned to give progress
   output like other slow operations.

 * The set of built-in function-header patterns for various languages
   knows MATLAB.

 * "git log --follow" honors the rename threshold score given with the
   -M option (e.g. "-M50%").

 * "git log --format='<format>'" learned new %g[nNeE] specifiers to
   show information from the reflog entries when warlking the reflog
   (i.e. with "-g").

 * "git pull" can be used to fetch and merge an annotated/signed tag,
   instead of the tip of a topic branch. The GPG signature from the
   signed tag is recorded in the resulting merge commit for later
   auditing.

 * "git branch --edit-description" can be used to add descriptive text
   to explain what a topic branch is about.

 * "git fmt-merge-msg" learned to take the branch description into
   account when preparing a merge summary that "git merge" records
   when merging a local branch.

 * "git request-pull" has been updated to convey more information
   useful for integrators to decide if a topic is worth merging and
   what is pulled is indeed what the requestor asked to pull,
   including:

   - the tip of the branch being requested to be merged;
   - the branch description describing what the topic is about;
   - the contents of the annotated tag, when requesting to pull a tag.

 * "git pull" learned to notice 'pull.rebase' configuration variable,
   which serves as a global fallback for setting 'branch.<name>.rebase'
   configuration variable per branch.

 * "git tag" learned "--cleanup" option to control how the whitespaces
   and empty lines in tag message are cleaned up.

 * "gitweb" learned to show side-by-side diff.

Also contains minor documentation updates and code clean-ups.


Fixes since v1.7.8
------------------

 * The replacement implemention for snprintf used on platforms with
   native snprintf that is broken did not use va_copy correctly.
   (merge a9bfbc5 jk/maint-snprintf-va-copy later to maint).

 * git native connection going over TCP (not over SSH) did not set
   SO_KEEPALIVE option which failed to receive link layer errors.
   (merge e47a858 ew/keepalive later to maint).

 * LF-to-CRLF streaming filter replaced all LF with CRLF, which might
   be techinically correct but not friendly to people who are trying
   to recover from earlier mistakes of using CRLF in the repository
   data in the first place. It now refrains from doing so for LF that
   follows a CR.
   (merge 8496f56 jc/maint-lf-to-crlf-keep-crlf later to maint).

 * "git checkout -m" did not recreate the conflicted state in a "both
   sides added, without any common ancestor version" conflict
   situation.
   (merge 5cd7fadc jc/checkout-m-twoway later to maint).

 * "git cherry-pick $commit" (not a range) created an unnecessary
   sequencer state and interfered with valid workflow to use the
   command during a session to cherry-pick multiple commits.
   (merge d596118 jn/maint-sequencer-fixes later to maint).

 * You could make "git commit" segfault by giving the "--no-message"
   option.
   (merge 03f94ae jk/maint-strbuf-missing-init later to maint).

 * "fast-import" did not correctly update an existing notes tree,
   possibly corrupting the fan-out.

 * "git fetch-pack" accepted unqualified refs that do not begin with
   refs/ by mistake and compensated it by matching the refspec with
   tail-match, which was doubly wrong. This broke fetching from a
   repository with a funny named ref "refs/foo/refs/heads/master" and a
   'master' branch with "git fetch-pack refs/heads/master", as the
   command incorrectly considered the former a "match".
   (merge bab8d28 jk/fetch-no-tail-match-refs later to maint).

 * "git mv" gave suboptimal error/warning messages when it overwrites
   target files. It also did not pay attention to "-v" option.
   (merge 534376c jk/maint-mv later to maint).

 * When a "reword" action in "git rebase -i" failed to run "commit --amend",
   we did not give the control back to the user to resolve the situation, and
   instead kept the original commit log message.
   (merge 0becb3e aw/rebase-i-stop-on-failure-to-amend later to maint).

 * Authenticated "git push" over dumb HTTP were broken with a recent
   change and failed without asking for password when username is
   given.
   (merge a4ddbc3 jk/maint-push-over-dav later to maint).

 * "git push" to an empty repository over HTTP were broken with a
   recent change to the ref handling.
   (merge 02f7914 jk/http-push-to-empty later to maint).

 * "git push -v" forgot how to be verbose by mistake. It now properly is.
   (merge bd2c86e jk/maint-push-v-is-verbose later to maint).

 * gitweb did not correctly fall back to configured $fallback_encoding
   that is not 'latin1'.
   (merge b13e3ea jn/maint-gitweb-utf8-fix later to maint).
