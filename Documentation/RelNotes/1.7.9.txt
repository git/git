Git v1.7.9 Release Notes (draft)
========================

Updates since v1.7.8
--------------------

 * git-gui updated to 0.16.0.

 * git-p4 (in contrib/) updates.

 * Porcelain commands like "git reset" did not distinguish deletions
   and type-changes from ordinary modification, and reported them with
   the same 'M' moniker. They now use 'D' (for deletion) and 'T' (for
   type-change) to match "git status -s" and "git diff --name-status".

 * "git branch -m <current branch> HEAD" is an obvious no-op and is
   now allowed.

 * "git checkout -B <current branch> <elsewhere>" is a more intuitive
   way to spell "git reset --keep <elsewhere>".

 * "git checkout" and "git merge" learned "--no-overwrite-ignore" option
   to tell Git that untracked and ignored files are not expendable.

 * fsck and prune are relatively lengthy operations that still go
   silent while making the end-user wait. They learned to give progress
   output like other slow operations.

 * The set of built-in function-header patterns for various languages
   knows MATLAB.

 * "git pull" can be used to fetch and merge an annotated/signed tag,
   instead of the tip of a topic branch. The GPG signature from the
   signed tag is recorded in the resulting merge commit for later
   auditing.

 * "git branch --edit-description" can be used to add descriptive text
   to explain what a topic branch is about.

 * "git fmt-merge-msg" learned to take the branch description into
   account when preparing a merge summary that "git merge" records
   when merging a local branch.

 * "git request-pull" has been updated to convey more information
   useful for integrators to decide if a topic is worth merging and
   what is pulled is indeed what the requestor asked to pull,
   including:

   - the tip of the branch being requested to be merged;
   - the branch description describing what the topic is about;
   - the contents of the annotated tag, when requesting to pull a tag.

 * "git pull" learned to notice 'pull.rebase' configuration variable,
   which serves as a global fallback for setting 'branch.<name>.rebase'
   configuration variable per branch.

 * "git tag" learned "--cleanup" option to control how the whitespaces
   and empty lines in tag message are cleaned up.

 * "gitweb" learned to show side-by-side diff.

Also contains minor documentation updates and code clean-ups.


Fixes since v1.7.8
------------------

 * The function header pattern for files with "diff=cpp" attribute did
   not consider "type *funcname(type param1,..." as the beginning of a
   function.
   (merge 37e7793 tr/userdiff-c-returns-pointer later to maint).

 * LF-to-CRLF streaming filter used when checking out a large-ish blob
   fell into an infinite loop with a rare input.
   (merge 284e3d2 cn/maint-lf-to-crlf-filter later to maint).

 * "git archive" mistakenly allowed remote clients to ask for commits
   that are not at the tip of any ref.
   (merge 7b51c33 jk/maint-upload-archive later to maint).

 * "git apply --check" did not error out when given an empty input
   without any patch.
   (merge cc64b31 bc/maint-apply-check-no-patch later to maint).

 * The error message from "git diff" and "git status" when they fail
   to inspect changes in submodules did not report which submodule they
   had trouble with.
   (merge 6a5ceda jl/submodule-status-failure-report later to maint).
