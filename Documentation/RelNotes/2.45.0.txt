Git v2.45 Release Notes
=======================

Backward Compatibility Notes

UI, Workflows & Features

 * Integrate the reftable code into the refs framework as a backend.
   With "git init --ref-format=reftable", hopefully it would be a lot
   more efficient to manage a repository with many references.

 * "git checkout -p" and friends learned that that "@" is a synonym
   for "HEAD".

 * Variants of vimdiff learned to honor mergetool.<variant>.layout
   settings.

 * "git reflog" learned a "list" subcommand that enumerates known reflogs.

 * When a merge conflicted at a submodule, merge-ort backend used to
   unconditionally give a lengthy message to suggest how to resolve
   it.  Now the message can be squelched as an advice message.

 * "git for-each-ref" learned "--include-root-refs" option to show
   even the stuff outside the 'refs/' hierarchy.

 * "git rev-list --missing=print" has learned to optionally take
   "--allow-missing-tips", which allows the objects at the starting
   points to be missing.

 * "git merge-tree" has learned that the three trees involved in the
   3-way merge only need to be trees, not necessarily commits.

 * "git log --merge" learned to pay attention to CHERRY_PICK_HEAD and
   other kinds of *_HEAD pseudorefs.


Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.

 * The code to iterate over refs with the reftable backend has seen
   some optimization.

 * More tests that are marked as "ref-files only" have been updated to
   improve test coverage of reftable backend.

 * Some parts of command line completion script (in contrib/) have
   been micro-optimized.

 * The way placeholders are to be marked-up in documentation have been
   specified; use "_<placeholder>_" to typeset the word inside a pair
   of <angle-brakets> emphasized.

 * "git --no-lazy-fetch cmd" allows to run "cmd" while disabling lazy
   fetching of objects from the promisor remote, which may be handy
   for debugging.

 * The implementation in "git clean" that makes "-n" and "-i" ignore
   clean.requireForce has been simplified, together with the
   documentation.

 * The code to iterate over refs with the reftable backend has seen
   some optimization.


Fixes since v2.44
-----------------

 * "git apply" on a filesystem without filemode support have learned
   to take a hint from what is in the index for the path, even when
   not working with the "--index" or "--cached" option, when checking
   the executable bit match what is required by the preimage in the
   patch.
   (merge 45b625142d cp/apply-core-filemode later to maint).

 * "git column" has been taught to reject negative padding value, as
   it would lead to nonsense behaviour including division by zero.
   (merge 76fb807faa kh/column-reject-negative-padding later to maint).

 * "git am --help" now tells readers what actions are available in
   "git am --whitespace=<action>", in addition to saying that the
   option is passed through to the underlying "git apply".
   (merge a171dac734 jc/am-whitespace-doc later to maint).

 * "git tag --column" failed to check the exit status of its "git
   column" invocation, which has been corrected.
   (merge 92e66478fc rj/tag-column-fix later to maint).

 * Credential helper based on libsecret (in contrib/) has been updated
   to handle an empty password correctly.
   (merge 8f1f2023b7 mh/libsecret-empty-password-fix later to maint).

 * "git difftool --dir-diff" learned to honor the "--trust-exit-code"
   option; it used to always exit with 0 and signalled success.
   (merge eb84c8b6ce ps/difftool-dir-diff-exit-code later to maint).

 * The code incorrectly attempted to use textconv cache when asked,
   even when we are not running in a repository, which has been
   corrected.
   (merge affe355fe7 jk/textconv-cache-outside-repo-fix later to maint).

 * Remove an empty file that shouldn't have been added in the first
   place.
   (merge 4f66942215 js/remove-cruft-files later to maint).

 * The logic to access reflog entries by date and number had ugly
   corner cases at the boundaries, which have been cleaned up.
   (merge 5edd126720 jk/reflog-special-cases-fix later to maint).

 * An error message from "git upload-pack", which responds to "git
   fetch" requests, had a trialing NUL in it, which has been
   corrected.
   (merge 3f4c7a0805 sg/upload-pack-error-message-fix later to maint).

 * Clarify wording in the CodingGuidelines that requires <git-compat-util.h>
   to be the first header file.
   (merge 4e89f0e07c jc/doc-compat-util later to maint).

 * "git commit -v --cleanup=scissors" used to add the scissors line
   twice in the log message buffer, which has been corrected.
   (merge e90cc075cc jt/commit-redundant-scissors-fix later to maint).

 * A custom remote helper no longer cannot access the newly created
   repository during "git clone", which is a regression in Git 2.44.
   This has been corrected.
   (merge 199f44cb2e ps/remote-helper-repo-initialization-fix later to maint).

 * Various parts of upload-pack has been updated to bound the resource
   consumption relative to the size of the repository to protect from
   abusive clients.
   (merge 6cd05e768b jk/upload-pack-bounded-resources later to maint).

 * The upload-pack program, when talking over v2, accepted the
   packfile-uris protocol extension from the client, even if it did
   not advertise the capability, which has been corrected.
   (merge a922bfa3b5 jk/upload-pack-v2-capability-cleanup later to maint).

 * Make sure failure return from merge_bases_many() is properly caught.
   (merge 25fd20eb44 js/merge-base-with-missing-commit later to maint).

 * FSMonitor client code was confused when FSEvents were given in a
   different case on a case-insensitive filesystem, which has been
   corrected.
   (merge 29c139ce78 jh/fsmonitor-icase-corner-case-fix later to maint).

 * The "core.commentChar" configuration variable only allows an ASCII
   character, which was not clearly documented, which has been
   corrected.
   (merge fb7c556f58 kh/doc-commentchar-is-a-byte later to maint).

 * With release 2.44 we got rid of all uses of test_i18ngrep and there
   is no in-flight topic that adds a new use of it.  Make a call to
   test_i18ngrep a hard failure, so that we can remove it at the end
   of this release cycle.
   (merge 381a83dfa3 jc/test-i18ngrep later to maint).

 * The command line completion script (in contrib/) learned to
   complete "git reflog" better.
   (merge 1284f9cc11 rj/complete-reflog later to maint).

 * The logic to complete the command line arguments to "git worktree"
   subcommand (in contrib/) has been updated to correctly honor things
   like "git -C dir" etc.
   (merge 3574816d98 rj/complete-worktree-paths-fix later to maint).

 * Other code cleanup, docfix, build fix, etc.
   (merge f0e578c69c rs/use-xstrncmpz later to maint).
   (merge 83e6eb7d7a ba/credential-test-clean-fix later to maint).
