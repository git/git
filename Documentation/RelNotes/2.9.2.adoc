Git v2.9.2 Release Notes
========================

Fixes since v2.9.1
------------------

 * A fix merged to v2.9.1 had a few tests that are not meant to be
   run on platforms without 64-bit long, which caused unnecessary
   test failures on them because we didn't detect the platform and
   skip them.  These tests are now skipped on platforms that they
   are not applicable to.

No other change is included in this update.
