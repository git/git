Git v2.12.2 Release Notes
=========================

Fixes since v2.12.1
-------------------

 * "but status --porcelain" is supposed to give a stable output, but a
   few strings were left as translatable by mistake.

 * "Dumb http" transport used to misparse a nonsense http-alternates
   response, which has been fixed.

 * "but diff --quiet" relies on the size field in diff_filespec to be
   correctly populated, but diff_populate_filespec() helper function
   made an incorrect short-cut when asked only to populate the size
   field for paths that need to go through convert_to_but() (e.g. CRLF
   conversion).

 * There is no need for Python only to give a few messages to the
   standard error stream, but we somehow did.

 * A leak in a codepath to read from a packed object in (rare) cases
   has been plugged.

 * "but upload-pack", which is a counter-part of "but fetch", did not
   report a request for a ref that was not advertised as invalid.
   This is generally not a problem (because "but fetch" will stop
   before making such a request), but is the right thing to do.

 * A "gc.log" file left by a backgrounded "gc --auto" disables further
   automatic gc; it has been taught to run at least once a day (by
   default) by ignoring a stale "gc.log" file that is too old.

 * "but remote rm X", when a branch has remote X configured as the
   value of its branch.*.remote, tried to remove branch.*.remote and
   branch.*.merge and failed if either is unset.

 * A caller of tempfile API that uses stdio interface to write to
   files may ignore errors while writing, which is detected when
   tempfile is closed (with a call to ferror()).  By that time, the
   original errno that may have told us what went wrong is likely to
   be long gone and was overwritten by an irrelevant value.
   close_tempfile() now resets errno to EIO to make errno at least
   predictable.

 * "but show-branch" expected there were only very short branch names
   in the repository and used a fixed-length buffer to hold them
   without checking for overflow.

 * The code that parses header fields in the cummit object has been
   updated for (micro)performance and code hygiene.

 * A test that creates a confusing branch whose name is HEAD has been
   corrected not to do so.

 * "Cc:" on the trailer part does not have to conform to RFC strictly,
   unlike in the e-mail header.  "but send-email" has been updated to
   ignore anything after '>' when picking addresses, to allow non-address
   cruft like " # stable 4.4" after the address.

 * "but push" had a handful of codepaths that could lead to a deadlock
   when unexpected error happened, which has been fixed.

 * Code to read submodule.<name>.ignore config did not state the
   variable name correctly when giving an error message diagnosing
   misconfiguration.

 * "but ls-remote" and "but archive --remote" are designed to work
   without being in a directory under Git's control.  However, recent
   updates revealed that we randomly look into a directory called
   .but/ without actually doing necessary set-up when working in a
   repository.  Stop doing so.

 * The code to parse the command line "but grep <patterns>... <rev>
   [[--] <pathspec>...]" has been cleaned up, and a handful of bugs
   have been fixed (e.g. we used to check "--" if it is a rev).

 * The code to parse "but -c VAR=VAL cmd" and set configuration
   variable for the duration of cmd had two small bugs, which have
   been fixed.
   This supersedes jc/config-case-cmdline topic that has been discarded.

Also contains various documentation updates and code clean-ups.
