Git v2.41.2 Release Notes
=========================

In preparing security fixes for four CVEs, we made overly aggressive
"defense in depth" changes that broke legitimate use cases like 'git
lfs' and 'git annex.'  This release is to revert these misguided, if
well-intentioned, changes that were shipped in 2.41.1 and were not
direct security fixes.

Jeff King (5):
      send-email: drop FakeTerm hack
      send-email: avoid creating more than one Term::ReadLine object
      ci: drop mention of BREW_INSTALL_PACKAGES variable
      ci: avoid bare "gcc" for osx-gcc job
      ci: stop installing "gcc-13" for osx-gcc

Johannes Schindelin (6):
      hook: plug a new memory leak
      init: use the correct path of the templates directory again
      Revert "core.hooksPath: add some protection while cloning"
      tests: verify that `clone -c core.hooksPath=/dev/null` works again
      clone: drop the protections where hooks aren't run
      Revert "Add a helper function to compare file contents"

Junio C Hamano (1):
      Revert "fsck: warn about symlink pointing inside a gitdir"
