Git v2.3.7 Release Notes
========================

Fixes since v2.3.6
------------------

 * An earlier update to the parser that disects a URL broke an
   address, followed by a colon, followed by an empty string (instead
   of the port number), e.g. ssh://example.com:/path/to/repo.

 * The completion script (in contrib/) contaminated global namespace
   and clobbered on a shell variable $x.

 * The "git push --signed" protocol extension did not limit what the
   "nonce" that is a server-chosen string can contain or how long it
   can be, which was unnecessarily lax.  Limit both the length and the
   alphabet to a reasonably small space that can still have enough
   entropy.

Also contains typofixes, documentation updates and trivial code
clean-ups.
