Git 2.32 Release Notes
======================

Backward compatibility notes
----------------------------

 * ".gitattributes", ".gitignore", and ".mailmap" files that are
   symbolic links are ignored.


Updates since v2.31
-------------------

UI, Workflows & Features

 * It does not make sense to make ".gitattributes", ".gitignore" and
   ".mailmap" symlinks, as they are supposed to be usable from the
   object store (think: bare repositories where HEAD:.mailmap etc. are
   used).  When these files are symbolic links, we used to read the
   contents of the files pointed by them by mistake, which has been
   corrected.

 * "git stash show" learned to optionally show untracked part of the
   stash.

 * "git log --format='...'" learned "%(describe)" placeholder.

 * "git repack" so far has been only capable of repacking everything
   under the sun into a single pack (or split by size).  A cleverer
   strategy to reduce the cost of repacking a repository has been
   introduced.

 * The http codepath learned to let the credential layer to cache the
   password used to unlock a certificate that has successfully been
   used.

 * "git commit --fixup=<commit>", which was to tweak the changes made
   to the contents while keeping the original log message intact,
   learned "--fixup=(amend|reword):<commit>", that can be used to
   tweak both the message and the contents, and only the message,
   respectively.

 * When accessing a server with a URL like https://user:pass@site/, we
   did not to fall back to the basic authentication with the
   credential material embedded in the URL after the "Negotiate"
   authentication failed.  Now we do.

 * "git send-email" learned to honor the core.hooksPath configuration.

 * "git format-patch -v<n>" learned to allow a reroll count that is
   not an integer.

 * "git commit" learned "--trailer <key>[=<value>]" option; together
   with the interpret-trailers command, this will make it easier to
   support custom trailers.

 * "git clone --reject-shallow" option fails the clone as soon as we
   notice that we are cloning from a shallow repository.

 * A configuration variable has been added to force tips of certain
   refs to be given a reachability bitmap.

 * "gitweb" learned "e-mail privacy" feature to redact strings that
   look like e-mail addresses on various pages.

 * "git apply --3way" has always been "to fall back to 3-way merge
   only when straight application fails". Swap the order of falling
   back so that 3-way is always attempted first (only when the option
   is given, of course) and then straight patch application is used as
   a fallback when it fails.

 * "git apply" now takes "--3way" and "--cached" at the same time, and
   work and record results only in the index.

 * The command line completion (in contrib/) has learned that
   CHERRY_PICK_HEAD is a possible pseudo-ref.


Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.

 * Rename detection rework continues.

 * GIT_TEST_FAIL_PREREQS is a mechanism to skip test pieces with
   prerequisites to catch broken tests that depend on the side effects
   of optional pieces, but did not work at all when negative
   prerequisites were involved.
   (merge 27d578d904 jk/fail-prereq-testfix later to maint).

 * "git diff-index" codepath has been taught to trust fsmonitor status
   to reduce number of lstat() calls.
   (merge 7e5aa13d2c nk/diff-index-fsmonitor later to maint).

 * Reorganize Makefile to allow building git.o and other essential
   objects without extra stuff needed only for testing.

 * Preparatory API changes for parallel checkout.

 * A simple IPC interface gets introduced to build services like
   fsmonitor on top.

 * Fsck API clean-up.

 * SECURITY.md that is facing individual contributors and end users
   has been introduced.  Also a procedure to follow when preparing
   embargoed releases has been spelled out.
   (merge 09420b7648 js/security-md later to maint).

 * Optimize "rev-list --use-bitmap-index --objects" corner case that
   uses negative tags as the stopping points.

 * CMake update for vsbuild.

 * An on-disk reverse-index to map the in-pack location of an object
   back to its object name across multiple packfiles is introduced.

 * Generate [ec]tags under $(QUIET_GEN).

 * Clean-up codepaths that implements "git send-email --validate"
   option and improves the message from it.

 * The last remnant of gettext-poison has been removed.

 * The test framework has been taught to optionally turn the default
   merge strategy to "ort" throughout the system where we use
   three-way merges internally, like cherry-pick, rebase etc.,
   primarily to enhance its test coverage (the strategy has been
   available as an explicit "-s ort" choice).


Fixes since v2.31
-----------------

 * The fsmonitor interface read from its input without making sure
   there is something to read from.  This bug is new in 2.31
   timeframe.

 * The data structure used by fsmonitor interface was not properly
   duplicated during an in-core merge, leading to use-after-free etc.

 * "git bisect" reimplemented more in C during 2.30 timeframe did not
   take an annotated tag as a good/bad endpoint well.  This regression
   has been corrected.

 * Fix macros that can silently inject unintended null-statements.

 * CALLOC_ARRAY() macro replaces many uses of xcalloc().

 * Update insn in Makefile comments to run fuzz-all target.

 * Fix a corner case bug in "git mv" on case insensitive systems,
   which was introduced in 2.29 timeframe.

 * We had a code to diagnose and die cleanly when a required
   clean/smudge filter is missing, but an assert before that
   unnecessarily fired, hiding the end-user facing die() message.
   (merge 6fab35f748 mt/cleanly-die-upon-missing-required-filter later to maint).

 * Update C code that sets a few configuration variables when a remote
   is configured so that it spells configuration variable names in the
   canonical camelCase.
   (merge 0f1da600e6 ab/remote-write-config-in-camel-case later to maint).

 * A new configuration variable has been introduced to allow choosing
   which version of the generation number gets used in the
   commit-graph file.
   (merge 702110aac6 ds/commit-graph-generation-config later to maint).

 * Perf test update to work better in secondary worktrees.
   (merge 36e834abc1 jk/perf-in-worktrees later to maint).

 * Updates to memory allocation code around the use of pcre2 library.
   (merge c1760352e0 ab/grep-pcre2-allocfix later to maint).

 * "git -c core.bare=false clone --bare ..." would have segfaulted,
   which has been corrected.
   (merge 75555676ad bc/clone-bare-with-conflicting-config later to maint).

 * When "git checkout" removes a path that does not exist in the
   commit it is checking out, it wasn't careful enough not to follow
   symbolic links, which has been corrected.
   (merge fab78a0c3d mt/checkout-remove-nofollow later to maint).

 * A few option description strings started with capital letters,
   which were corrected.
   (merge 5ee90326dc cc/downcase-opt-help later to maint).

 * Plug or annotate remaining leaks that trigger while running the
   very basic set of tests.
   (merge 68ffe095a2 ah/plugleaks later to maint).

 * The hashwrite() API uses a buffering mechanism to avoid calling
   write(2) too frequently. This logic has been refactored to be
   easier to understand.
   (merge ddaf1f62e3 ds/clarify-hashwrite later to maint).

 * "git cherry-pick/revert" with or without "--[no-]edit" did not spawn
   the editor as expected (e.g. "revert --no-edit" after a conflict
   still asked to edit the message), which has been corrected.
   (merge 39edfd5cbc en/sequencer-edit-upon-conflict-fix later to maint).

 * "git daemon" has been tightened against systems that take backslash
   as directory separator.
   (merge 9a7f1ce8b7 rs/daemon-sanitize-dir-sep later to maint).

 * A NULL-dereference bug has been corrected in an error codepath in
   "git for-each-ref", "git branch --list" etc.
   (merge c685450880 jk/ref-filter-segfault-fix later to maint).

 * Streamline the codepath to fix the UTF-8 encoding issues in the
   argv[] and the prefix on macOS.
   (merge c7d0e61016 tb/precompose-prefix-simplify later to maint).

 * The command-line completion script (in contrib/) had a couple of
   references that would have given a warning under the "-u" (nounset)
   option.
   (merge c5c0548d79 vs/completion-with-set-u later to maint).

 * Other code cleanup, docfix, build fix, etc.
   (merge f451960708 dl/cat-file-doc-cleanup later to maint).
   (merge 12604a8d0c sv/t9801-test-path-is-file-cleanup later to maint).
