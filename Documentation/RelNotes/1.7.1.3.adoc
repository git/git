Git v1.7.1.3 Release Notes
==========================

This is primarily to backport support for the new "add.ignoreErrors"
name given to the existing "add.ignore-errors" configuration variable.

The next version, Git 1.7.4, and future versions, will support both
old and incorrect name and the new corrected name, but without this
backport, users who want to use the new name "add.ignoreErrors" in
their repositories cannot use older versions of Git.
