Git 2.36 Release Notes
======================

Updates since Git 2.35
----------------------

Backward compatibility warts

 * "git name-rev --stdin" has been deprecated and issues a warning
   when used; use "git name-rev --annotate-stdin" instead.


Note to those who build from the source

 *


UI, Workflows & Features

 * Assorted updates to "git cat-file", especially "-h".

 * The command line completion (in contrib/) learns to complete
   arguments to give to "git sparse-checkout" command.

 * "git log --remerge-diff" shows the difference from mechanical merge
   result and the result that is actually recorded in a merge commit.


Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.

 * "git apply" (ab)used the util pointer of the string-list to keep
   track of how each symbolic link needs to be handled, which has been
   simplified by using strset.

 * Fix a hand-rolled alloca() imitation that may have violated
   alignment requirement of data being sorted in compatibility
   implementation of qsort_s() and stable qsort().

 * Use the parse-options API in "git reflog" command.

 * The conditional inclusion mechanism of configuration files using
   "[includeIf <condition>]" learns to base its decision on the
   URL of the remote repository the repository interacts with.
   (merge 399b198489 jt/conditional-config-on-remote-url later to maint).

 * "git name-rev --stdin" does not behave like usual "--stdin" at
   all.  Start the process of renaming it to "--annotate-stdin".
   (merge a2585719b3 jc/name-rev-stdin later to maint).


Fixes since v2.35
-----------------

 * "rebase" and "stash" in secondary worktrees are broken in
   Git 2.35.0, which has been corrected.

 * "git pull --rebase" ignored the rebase.autostash configuration
   variable when the remote history is a descendant of our history,
   which has been corrected.
   (merge 3013d98d7a pb/pull-rebase-autostash-fix later to maint).

 * "git update-index --refresh" has been taught to deal better with
   racy timestamps (just like "git status" already does).
   (merge 2ede073fd2 ms/update-index-racy later to maint).

 * Avoid tests that are run under GIT_TRACE2 set from failing
   unnecessarily.
   (merge 944d808e42 js/test-unset-trace2-parents later to maint).

 * The merge-ort misbehaved when merge.renameLimit configuration is
   set too low and failed to find all renames.
   (merge 9ae39fef7f en/merge-ort-restart-optim-fix later to maint).

 * We explain that revs come first before the pathspec among command
   line arguments, but did not spell out that dashed options come
   before other args, which has been corrected.
   (merge c11f95010c tl/doc-cli-options-first later to maint).

 * "git add -p" rewritten in C regressed hunk splitting in some cases,
   which has been corrected.
   (merge 7008ddc645 pw/add-p-hunk-split-fix later to maint).

 * "git fetch --negotiate-only" is an internal command used by "git
   push" to figure out which part of our history is missing from the
   other side.  It should never recurse into submodules even when
   fetch.recursesubmodules configuration variable is set, nor it
   should trigger "gc".  The code has been tightened up to ensure it
   only does common ancestry discovery and nothing else.
   (merge de4eaae63a gc/fetch-negotiate-only-early-return later to maint).

 * The code path that verifies signatures made with ssh were made to
   work better on a system with CRLF line endings.
   (merge caeef01ea7 fs/ssh-signing-crlf later to maint).

 * "git sparse-checkout init" failed to write into $GIT_DIR/info
   directory when the repository was created without one, which has
   been corrected to auto-create it.
   (merge 7f44842ac1 jt/sparse-checkout-leading-dir-fix later to maint).

 * Cloning from a repository that does not yet have any branches or
   tags but has other refs resulted in a "remote transport reported
   error", which has been corrected.
   (merge dccea605b6 jt/clone-not-quite-empty later to maint).

 * Mark in various places in the code that the sparse index and the
   split index features are mutually incompatible.
   (merge 451b66c533 js/sparse-vs-split-index later to maint).

 * Update the logic to compute alignment requirement for our mem-pool.
   (merge e38bcc66d8 jc/mem-pool-alignment later to maint).

 * Pick a better random number generator and use it when we prepare
   temporary filenames.
   (merge 47efda967c bc/csprng-mktemps later to maint).

 * Update the contributor-facing documents on proposed log messages.
   (merge cdba0295b0 jc/doc-log-messages later to maint).

 * When "git fetch --prune" failed to prune the refs it wanted to
   prune, the command issued error messages but exited with exit
   status 0, which has been corrected.
   (merge c9e04d905e tg/fetch-prune-exit-code-fix later to maint).

 * Problems identified by Coverity in the reftable code have been
   corrected.
   (merge 01033de49f hn/reftable-coverity-fixes later to maint).

 * A bug that made multi-pack bitmap and the object order out-of-sync,
   making the .midx data corrupt, has been fixed.
   (merge f8b60cf99b tb/midx-bitmap-corruption-fix later to maint).

 * The build procedure has been taught to notice older version of zlib
   and enable our replacement uncompress2() automatically.
   (merge 07564773c2 ab/auto-detect-zlib-compress2 later to maint).

 * Interaction between fetch.negotiationAlgorithm and
   feature.experimental configuration variables has been corrected.
   (merge 714edc620c en/fetch-negotiation-default-fix later to maint).

 * "git diff --diff-filter=aR" is now parsed correctly.
   (merge 75408ca949 js/diff-filter-negation-fix later to maint).

 * Other code cleanup, docfix, build fix, etc.
   (merge cfc5cf428b jc/find-header later to maint).
