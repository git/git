GIT v1.6.4.3 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.6.4.2
--------------------

* "git clone" from an empty repository gave unnecessary error message,
  even though it did everything else correctly.

* "git cvsserver" invoked git commands via "git-foo" style, which has long
  been deprecated.

* "git fetch" and "git clone" had an extra sanity check to verify the
  presence of the corresponding *.pack file before downloading *.idx
  file by issuing a HEAD request.  Github server however sometimes
  gave 500 (Internal server error) response to HEAD even if a GET
  request for *.pack file to the same URL would have succeeded, and broke
  clone over HTTP from some of their repositories.  As a workaround, this
  verification has been removed (as it is not absolutely necessary).

* "git grep" did not like relative pathname to refer outside the current
  directory when run from a subdirectory.

* an error message from "git push" was formatted in a very ugly way.

* "git svn" did not quote the subversion user name correctly when
  running its author-prog helper program.

Other minor documentation updates are included.
