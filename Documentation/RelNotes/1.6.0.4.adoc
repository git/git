GIT v1.6.0.4 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.6.0.3
--------------------

* 'git add -p' said "No changes" when only binary files were changed.

* 'git archive' did not work correctly in bare repositories.

* 'git checkout -t -b newbranch' when you are on detached HEAD was broken.

* when we refuse to detect renames because there are too many new or
  deleted files, 'git diff' did not say how many there are.

* 'git push --mirror' tried and failed to push the stash; there is no
  point in sending it to begin with.

* 'git push' did not update the remote tracking reference if the corresponding
  ref on the remote end happened to be already up to date.

* 'git pull $there $branch:$current_branch' did not work when you were on
  a branch yet to be born.

* when giving up resolving a conflicted merge, 'git reset --hard' failed
  to remove new paths from the working tree.

* 'git send-email' had a small fd leak while scanning directory.

* 'git status' incorrectly reported a submodule directory as an untracked
  directory.

* 'git svn' used deprecated 'git-foo' form of subcommand invocation.

* 'git update-ref -d' to remove a reference did not honor --no-deref option.

* Plugged small memleaks here and there.

* Also contains many documentation updates.
