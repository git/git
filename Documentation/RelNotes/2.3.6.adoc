Git v2.3.6 Release Notes
========================

Fixes since v2.3.5
------------------

 * "diff-highlight" (in contrib/) used to show byte-by-byte
   differences, which meant that multi-byte characters can be chopped
   in the middle.  It learned to pay attention to character boundaries
   (assuming the UTF-8 payload).

Also contains typofixes, documentation updates and trivial code
clean-ups.
