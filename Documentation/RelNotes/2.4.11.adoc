Git v2.4.11 Release Notes
=========================

Fixes since v2.4.10
-------------------

 * Bugfix patches were backported from the 'master' front to plug heap
   corruption holes, to catch integer overflow in the computation of
   pathname lengths, and to get rid of the name_path API.  Both of
   these would have resulted in writing over an under-allocated buffer
   when formulating pathnames while tree traversal.
