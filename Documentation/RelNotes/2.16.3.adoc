Git v2.16.3 Release Notes
=========================

Fixes since v2.16.2
-------------------

 * "git status" after moving a path in the working tree (hence making
   it appear "removed") and then adding with the -N option (hence
   making that appear "added") detected it as a rename, but did not
   report the  old and new pathnames correctly.

 * "git commit --fixup" did not allow "-m<message>" option to be used
   at the same time; allow it to annotate resulting commit with more
   text.

 * When resetting the working tree files recursively, the working tree
   of submodules are now also reset to match.

 * Fix for a commented-out code to adjust it to a rather old API change
   around object ID.

 * When there are too many changed paths, "git diff" showed a warning
   message but in the middle of a line.

 * The http tracing code, often used to debug connection issues,
   learned to redact potentially sensitive information from its output
   so that it can be more safely shareable.

 * Crash fix for a corner case where an error codepath tried to unlock
   what it did not acquire lock on.

 * The split-index mode had a few corner case bugs fixed.

 * Assorted fixes to "git daemon".

 * Completion of "git merge -s<strategy>" (in contrib/) did not work
   well in non-C locale.

 * Workaround for segfault with more recent versions of SVN.

 * Recently introduced leaks in fsck have been plugged.

 * Travis CI integration now builds the executable in 'script' phase
   to follow the established practice, rather than during
   'before_script' phase.  This allows the CI categorize the failures
   better ('failed' is project's fault, 'errored' is build
   environment's).

Also contains various documentation updates and code clean-ups.
