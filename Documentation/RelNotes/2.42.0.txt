Git v2.42 Release Notes
=======================

UI, Workflows & Features

 * "git pack-refs" learns "--include" and "--exclude" to tweak the ref
   hierarchy to be packed using pattern matching.

 * 'git worktree add' learned how to create a worktree based on an
   orphaned branch with `--orphan`.

 * "git pack-objects" learned to invoke a new hook program that
   enumerates extra objects to be used as anchoring points to keep
   otherwise unreachable objects in cruft packs.

 * Add more "git var" for toolsmiths to learn various locations Git is
   configured with either via the configuration or hardcoded defaults.

 * 'git notes append' was taught '--separator' to specify string to insert
   between paragraphs.


Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.

 * "git diff-tree" has been taught to take advantage of the
   sparse-index feature.

 * Clang's sanitizer implementation seems to work better than GCC's.
   (merge d88d727143 jk/ci-use-clang-for-sanitizer-jobs later to maint).

 * The object traversal using reachability bitmap done by
   "pack-object" has been tweaked to take advantage of the fact that
   using "boundary" commits as representative of all the uninteresting
   ones can save quite a lot of object enumeration.

 * discover_git_directory() no longer touches the_repository.

 * "git worktree" learned to work better with sparse index feature.

 * When the external merge driver is killed by a signal, its output
   should not be trusted as a resolution with conflicts that is
   proposed by the driver, but the code did.

 * The set-up code for the get_revision() API now allows feeding
   options like --all and --not in the --stdin mode.

 * Move functions that are not about pure string manipulation out of
   strbuf.[ch]


Fixes since v2.41
-----------------

 * "git tag" learned to leave the "$GIT_DIR/TAG_EDITMSG" file when the
   command failed, so that the user can salvage what they typed.
   (merge 08c12ec1d0 kh/keep-tag-editmsg-upon-failure later to maint).

 * The "-s" (silent, squelch) option of the "diff" family of commands
   did not interact with other options that specify the output format
   well.  This has been cleaned up so that it will clear all the
   formatting options given before.
   (merge 9d484b92ed jc/diff-s-with-other-options later to maint).

 * Update documentation regarding Coccinelle patches.
   (merge 3bd0097cfc gc/doc-cocci-updates later to maint).

 * Some atoms that can be used in "--format=<format>" for "git ls-tree"
   were not supported by "git ls-files", even though they were relevant
   in the context of the latter.
   (merge 4d28c4f75f zh/ls-files-format-atoms later to maint).

 * Document more pseudo-refs and teach the command line completion
   machinery to complete AUTO_MERGE.
   (merge 982ff3a649 pb/complete-and-document-auto-merge-and-friends later to maint).

 * "git submodule" code trusted the data coming from the config (and
   the in-tree .gitmodules file) too much without validating, leading
   to NULL dereference if the user mucks with a repository (e.g.
   submodule.<name>.url is removed).  This has been corrected.
   (merge fbc806acd1 tb/submodule-null-deref-fix later to maint).

 * The value of config.worktree is per-repository, but has been kept
   in a singleton global variable per process. This has been OK as
   most Git operations interacted with a single repository at a time,
   but not right for operations like recursive "grep" that want to
   access multiple repositories from a single process without forking.

   The global variable has been eliminated and made into a member in
   the per-repository data structure.
   (merge 3867f6d650 vd/worktree-config-is-per-repository later to maint).

 * "git [-c log.follow=true] log [--follow] ':(glob)f**'" used to barf.
   (merge 8260bc5902 jk/log-follow-with-non-literal-pathspec later to maint).

 * Introduce a mechanism to disable replace refs globally and per
   repository.
   (merge 9c7d1b057f ds/disable-replace-refs later to maint).

 * "git cat-file --batch" and friends learned "-Z" that uses NUL
   delimiter for both input and output.
   (merge f79e18849b ps/cat-file-null-output later to maint).

 * The reimplemented "git add -i" did not honor color.ui configuration.
   (merge 6f74648cea ds/add-i-color-configuration-fix later to maint).

 * Compilation fix for platforms without D_TYPE in struct dirent.
   (merge 03bf92b9bf as/dtype-compilation-fix later to maint).

 * Suggest to refrain from using hex literals that are non-portable
   when writing printf(1) format strings.
   (merge f0b68f0546 jt/doc-use-octal-with-printf later to maint).

 * Simplify error message when run-command fails to start a command.
   (merge 6d224ac286 rs/run-command-exec-error-on-noent later to maint).

 * Gracefully deal with a stale MIDX file that lists a packfile that
   no longer exists.
   (merge 06f3867865 tb/open-midx-bitmap-fallback later to maint).

 * Even when diff.ignoreSubmodules tells us to ignore submodule
   changes, "git commit" with an index that already records changes to
   submodules should include the submodule changes in the resulting
   commit, but it did not.
   (merge 5768478edc js/defeat-ignore-submodules-config-with-explicit-addition later to maint).

 * When "git commit --trailer=..." invokes the interpret-trailers
   machinery, it knows what it feeds to interpret-trailers is a full
   log message without any patch, but failed to express that by
   passing the "--no-divider" option, which has been corrected.
   (merge be3d654343 jk/commit-use-no-divider-with-interpret-trailers later to maint).

 * Avoid breakage of "git pack-objects --cruft" due to inconsistency
   between the way the code enumerates packfiles in the repository.
   (merge 73320e49ad tb/collect-pack-filenames-fix later to maint).

 * We create .pack and then .idx, we consider only packfiles that have
   .idx usable (those with only .pack are not ready yet), so we should
   remove .idx before removing .pack for consistency.
   (merge 0dd1324a73 ds/remove-idx-before-pack later to maint).

 * Partially revert a sanity check that the rest of the config code
   was not ready, to avoid triggering it in a corner case.
   (merge a53f43f900 gc/config-partial-submodule-kvi-fix later to maint).

 * "git apply" punts when it is fed too large a patch input; the error
   message it gives when it happens has been clarified.
   (merge 42612e18d2 pw/apply-too-large later to maint).

 * During a cherry-pick or revert session that works on multiple
   commits, "git status" did not give correct information, which has
   been corrected.
   (merge a096a889f4 jk/cherry-pick-revert-status later to maint).

 * Other code cleanup, docfix, build fix, etc.
   (merge 51f9d2e563 sa/doc-ls-remote later to maint).
   (merge c6d26a9dda jk/format-patch-message-id-unleak later to maint).
