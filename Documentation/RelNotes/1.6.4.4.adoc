GIT v1.6.4.4 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.6.4.4
--------------------

* The workaround for Github server that sometimes gave 500 (Internal server
  error) response to HEAD requests in 1.6.4.3 introduced a regression that
  caused re-fetching projects over http to segfault in certain cases due
  to uninitialized pointer being freed.

* "git pull" on an unborn branch used to consider anything in the work
  tree and the index discardable.

* "git diff -b/w" did not work well on the incomplete line at the end of
  the file, due to an incorrect hashing of lines in the low-level xdiff
  routines.

* "git checkout-index --prefix=$somewhere" used to work when $somewhere is
  a symbolic link to a directory elsewhere, but v1.6.4.2 broke it.

* "git unpack-objects --strict", invoked when receive.fsckobjects
  configuration is set in the receiving repository of "git push", did not
  properly check the objects, especially the submodule links, it received.

Other minor documentation updates are included.
