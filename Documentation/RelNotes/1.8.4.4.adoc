Git v1.8.4.4 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.8.4.3
--------------------

 * The fix in v1.8.4.3 to the pack transfer protocol to propagate
   the target of symbolic refs broke "git clone/git fetch" from a
   repository with too many symbolic refs. As a hotfix/workaround,
   we transfer only the information on HEAD.
