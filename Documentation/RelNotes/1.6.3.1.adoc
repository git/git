GIT v1.6.3.1 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.6.3
------------------

* "git checkout -b new-branch" with a staged change in the index
  incorrectly primed the in-index cache-tree, resulting a wrong tree
  object to be written out of the index.  This is a grave regression
  since the last 1.6.2.X maintenance release.
