Git v2.7.1 Release Notes
========================

Fixes since v2.7
----------------

 * An earlier change in 2.5.x-era broke users' hooks and aliases by
   exporting GIT_WORK_TREE to point at the root of the working tree,
   interfering when they tried to use a different working tree without
   setting GIT_WORK_TREE environment themselves.

 * The "exclude_list" structure has the usual "alloc, nr" pair of
   fields to be used by ALLOC_GROW(), but clear_pattern_list() forgot
   to reset 'alloc' to 0 when it cleared 'nr' to discard the managed
   array.

 * "git send-email" was confused by escaped quotes stored in the alias
   files saved by "mutt", which has been corrected.

 * A few unportable C construct have been spotted by clang compiler
   and have been fixed.

 * The documentation has been updated to hint the connection between
   the '--signoff' option and DCO.

 * "git reflog" incorrectly assumed that all objects that used to be
   at the tip of a ref must be commits, which caused it to segfault.

 * The ignore mechanism saw a few regressions around untracked file
   listing and sparse checkout selection areas in 2.7.0; the change
   that is responsible for the regression has been reverted.

 * Some codepaths used fopen(3) when opening a fixed path in $GIT_DIR
   (e.g. COMMIT_EDITMSG) that is meant to be left after the command is
   done.  This however did not work well if the repository is set to
   be shared with core.sharedRepository and the umask of the previous
   user is tighter.  They have been made to work better by calling
   unlink(2) and retrying after fopen(3) fails with EPERM.

 * Asking gitweb for a nonexistent commit left a warning in the server
   log.

 * "git rebase", unlike all other callers of "gc --auto", did not
   ignore the exit code from "gc --auto".

 * Many codepaths that run "gc --auto" before exiting kept packfiles
   mapped and left the file descriptors to them open, which was not
   friendly to systems that cannot remove files that are open.  They
   now close the packs before doing so.

 * A recent optimization to filter-branch in v2.7.0 introduced a
   regression when --prune-empty filter is used, which has been
   corrected.

 * The description for SANITY prerequisite the test suite uses has
   been clarified both in the comment and in the implementation.

 * "git tag" started listing a tag "foo" as "tags/foo" when a branch
   named "foo" exists in the same repository; remove this unnecessary
   disambiguation, which is a regression introduced in v2.7.0.

 * The way "git svn" uses auth parameter was broken by Subversion
   1.9.0 and later.

 * The "split" subcommand of "git subtree" (in contrib/) incorrectly
   skipped merges when it shouldn't, which was corrected.

 * A few options of "git diff" did not work well when the command was
   run from a subdirectory.

 * dirname() emulation has been added, as Msys2 lacks it.

 * The underlying machinery used by "ls-files -o" and other commands
   have been taught not to create empty submodule ref cache for a
   directory that is not a submodule.  This removes a ton of wasted
   CPU cycles.

 * Drop a few old "todo" items by deciding that the change one of them
   suggests is not such a good idea, and doing the change the other
   one suggested to do.

 * Documentation for "git fetch --depth" has been updated for clarity.

 * The command line completion learned a handful of additional options
   and command specific syntax.

Also includes a handful of documentation and test updates.
