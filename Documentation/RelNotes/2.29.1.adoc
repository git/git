Git v2.29.1 Release Notes
=========================

This is to fix the build procedure change in 2.28 where we failed to
install a few programs that should be installed in /usr/bin (namely,
receive-pack, upload-archive and upload-pack) when the non-default
SKIP_DASHED_BUILT_INS installation option is in effect.

A minor glitch in a non-default installation may usually not deserve
a hotfix, but I know Git for Windows ship binaries built with this
option, so let's make an exception.
