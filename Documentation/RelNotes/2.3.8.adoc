Git v2.3.8 Release Notes
========================

Fixes since v2.3.7
------------------

 * The usual "git diff" when seeing a file turning into a directory
   showed a patchset to remove the file and create all files in the
   directory, but "git diff --no-index" simply refused to work.  Also,
   when asked to compare a file and a directory, imitate POSIX "diff"
   and compare the file with the file with the same name in the
   directory, instead of refusing to run.

 * The default $HOME/.gitconfig file created upon "git config --global"
   that edits it had incorrectly spelled user.name and user.email
   entries in it.

 * "git commit --date=now" or anything that relies on approxidate lost
   the daylight-saving-time offset.

Also contains typofixes, documentation updates and trivial code
clean-ups.
