Git v1.8.3.4 Release Notes
==========================

This update is mostly to propagate documentation fixes and test
updates from the master front back to the maintenance track.

Fixes since v1.8.3.3
--------------------

 * The bisect log listed incorrect commits when bisection ends with
   only skipped ones.

 * The test coverage framework was left broken for some time.

 * The test suite for HTTP transport did not run with Apache 2.4.

 * "git diff" used to fail when core.safecrlf is set and the working
   tree contents had mixed CRLF/LF line endings. Committing such a
   content must be prohibited, but "git diff" should help the user to
   locate and fix such problems without failing.
