GIT v1.5.0.5 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.5.0.3
--------------------

* Bugfixes

  - git-merge (hence git-pull) did not refuse fast-forwarding
    when the working tree had local changes that would have
    conflicted with it.

  - git.el does not add duplicate sign-off lines.

  - git-commit shows the full stat of the resulting commit, not
    just about the files in the current directory, when run from
    a subdirectory.

  - "git-checkout -m '@{8 hours ago}'" had a funny failure from
    eval; fixed.

  - git-gui updates.

* Documentation updates

* User manual updates
