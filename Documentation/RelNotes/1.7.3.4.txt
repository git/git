Git v1.7.3.4 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.7.3.3
--------------------

 * Smart HTTP transport used to incorrectly retry redirected POST
   request with GET request.

 * "but apply" did not correctly handle patches that only change modes
   if told to apply while stripping leading paths with -p option.

 * "but apply" can deal with patches with timezone formatted with a
   colon between the hours and minutes part (e.g. "-08:00" instead of
   "-0800").

 * "but checkout" removed an untracked file "foo" from the working
   tree when switching to a branch that contains a tracked path
   "foo/bar".  Prevent this, just like the case where the conflicting
   path were "foo" (c752e7f..7980872d).

 * "but cherry-pick" or "but revert" refused to work when a path that
   would be modified by the operation was stat-dirty without a real
   difference in the contents of the file.

 * "but diff --check" reported an incorrect line number for added
   blank lines at the end of file.

 * "but imap-send" failed to build under NO_OPENSSL.

 * Setting log.decorate configuration variable to "0" or "1" to mean
   "false" or "true" did not work.

 * "but push" over dumb HTTP protocol did not work against WebDAV
   servers that did not terminate a collection name with a slash.

 * "but tag -v" did not work with GPG signatures in rfc1991 mode.

 * The post-receive-email sample hook was accidentally broken in 1.7.3.3
   update.

 * "butweb" can sometimes be tricked into parrotting a filename argument
   given in a request without properly quoting.

Other minor fixes and documentation updates are also included.
