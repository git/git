Git v1.7.7.3 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.7.7.2
--------------------

 * Adjust the "quick-install-doc" procedures as preformatted
   html/manpage are no longer in the source repository.

 * The logic to optimize the locality of the data in a pack introduced in
   1.7.7 was grossly inefficient.

 * The logic to filter out forked projects in the project list in
   "gitweb" was broken for some time.

 * "git branch -m/-M" advertised to update RENAME_REF ref in the
   commit log message that introduced the feature but not anywhere in
   the documentation, and never did update such a ref anyway. This
   undocumented misfeature that did not exist has been excised.
