Git v1.8.0 Release Notes
========================

Backward compatibility notes
----------------------------

In the next major release, we will change the behaviour of the "git
push" command.  When "git push [$there]" does not say what to push, we
have used the traditional "matching" semantics (all your branches were
sent to the remote as long as there already are branches of the same
name over there).  We will use the "simple" semantics, that pushes the
current branch to the branch with the same name only when the current
branch is set to integrate with that remote branch.  There is a user
preference configuration variable "push.default" to change this, and
"git push" will warn about the upcoming change until you set this
variable.


Updates since v1.7.12
---------------------

UI, Workflows & Features

 * A credential helper for Win32 to allow access to the keychain of
   the logged-in user has been added.

 * "git difftool --dir-diff" learned to use symbolic links to prepare
   temporary copy of the working tree when available.

 * "git grep" learned to use a non-standard pattern type by default if
   a configuration variable tells it to.

Foreign Interface

 * "git svn" has been updated to work with SVN 1.7.

Performance, Internal Implementation, etc. (please report possible regressions)

 * The "check-docs" build target has been updated and greatly
   simplified.

 * The documentation in the TeXinfo format was using indented output
   for materials meant to be examples that are better typeset in
   monospace.

Also contains minor documentation updates and code clean-ups.


Fixes since v1.7.12
-------------------

Unless otherwise noted, all the fixes since v1.7.12 in the
maintenance track are contained in this release (see release notes
to them for details).

 * Code to work around MacOS X UTF-8 gotcha has been cleaned up.
   (merge 9a27f96 rr/precompose-utf8-cleanup later to maint).

 * Documentation for the configuration file format had a confusing
   example.
   (merge d1e1fe7 mh/maint-config-doc-proxy-command later to maint).

 * "git submodule <cmd> path" did not error out when the path to the
   submodule was misspelt.
   (merge be9d0a3 hv/submodule-path-unmatch later to maint).

 * Some capabilities were asked by fetch-pack even when upload-pack
   did not advertise that they are available.  fetch-pack has been
   fixed not to do so.

 * The reflog entries left by "git rebase" and "git rebase -i" were
   inconsistent (the interactive one gave an abbreviated object name).
   (merge 1af221e mg/rebase-i-onto-reflog-in-full later to maint).

 * When the user exports a non-default IFS without HT, scripts that
   rely on being able to parse "ls-files -s | while read a b c..."
   start to fail.  Protect them from such a misconfiguration.
   (merge 785063e jc/maint-protect-sh-from-ifs later to maint).

 * "git prune" without "-v" used to warn about leftover temporary
   files (which is an indication of an earlier aborted operation).
   (merge 90b29cb bc/prune-info later to maint).

 * When "git push" triggered the automatic gc on the receiving end, a
   message from "git prune" that said it was removing cruft leaked to
   the standard output, breaking the communication protocol.
   (merge 4b7f2fa bc/receive-pack-stdout-protection later to maint).

 * "git diff" had a confusion between taking data from a path in the
   working tree and taking data from an object that happens to have
   name 0{40} recorded in a tree.
   (merge c479d14 jk/maint-null-in-trees later to maint).

 * The output from "git diff -B" for a file that ends with an
   incomplete line did not put "\ No newline..." on a line of its own.

 * "git send-email" did not unquote encoded words that appear on the
   header correctly, and lost "_" from strings.
   (merge b622d4d tr/maint-send-email-2047 later to maint).

 * When the user gives an argument that can be taken as both a
   revision name and a pathname without disambiguating with "--", we
   used to give a help message "Use '--' to separate".  The message
   has been clarified to show where that '--' goes on the command
   line.
   (merge 4d4b573 mm/die-with-dashdash-help later to maint).

 * "gitweb" when used with PATH_INFO failed to notice directories with
   SP (and other characters that need URL-style quoting) in them.
   (merge cacfc09 js/gitweb-path-info-unquote later to maint).
