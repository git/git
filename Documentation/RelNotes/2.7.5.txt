Git v2.7.5 Release Notes
========================

Fixes since v2.7.4
------------------

 * "git-shell" rejects a request to serve a repository whose name
   begins with a dash, which makes it no longer possible to get it
   confused into spawning service programs like "git-upload-pack" with
   an option like "--help", which in turn would spawn an interactive
   pager, instead of working with the repository user asked to access
   (i.e. the one whose name is "--help").

Also contains a few fixes backported from later development tracks.
