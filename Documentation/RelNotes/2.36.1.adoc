Git v2.36.1 Release Notes
=========================

Fixes since v2.36
-----------------

 * "git submodule update" without pathspec should silently skip an
   uninitialized submodule, but it started to become noisy by mistake.

 * "diff-tree --stdin" has been broken for about a year, but 2.36
   release broke it even worse by breaking running the command with
   <pathspec>, which in turn broke "gitk" and got noticed.  This has
   been corrected by aligning its behaviour to that of "log".

 * Regression fix for 2.36 where "git name-rev" started to sometimes
   reference strings after they are freed.

 * "git show <commit1> <commit2>... -- <pathspec>" lost the pathspec
   when showing the second and subsequent commits, which has been
   corrected.

 * "git fast-export -- <pathspec>" lost the pathspec when showing the
   second and subsequent commits, which has been corrected.

 * "git format-patch <args> -- <pathspec>" lost the pathspec when
   showing the second and subsequent commits, which has been
   corrected.

 * Get rid of a bogus and over-eager coccinelle rule.

 * Correct choices of C compilers used in various CI jobs.

Also contains minor documentation updates and code clean-ups.
