Git v2.5.4 Release Notes
========================

Fixes since v2.5.4
------------------

 * xdiff code we use to generate diffs is not prepared to handle
   extremely large files.  It uses "int" in many places, which can
   overflow if we have a very large number of lines or even bytes in
   our input files, for example.  Cap the input size to somewhere
   around 1GB for now.

 * Some protocols (like git-remote-ext) can execute arbitrary code
   found in the URL.  The URLs that submodules use may come from
   arbitrary sources (e.g., .gitmodules files in a remote
   repository), and can hurt those who blindly enable recursive
   fetch.  Restrict the allowed protocols to well known and safe
   ones.
