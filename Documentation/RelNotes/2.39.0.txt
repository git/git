Git v2.39 Release Notes
=======================

UI, Workflows & Features
------------------------

 * "git grep" learned to expand the sparse-index more lazily and on
   demand in a sparse checkout.

 * By default, use of fsmonitor on a repository on networked
   filesystem is disabled. Add knobs to make it workable on macOS.

 * After checking out a "branch" that is a symbolic-ref that points at
   another branch, "git symbolic-ref HEAD" reports the underlying
   branch, not the symbolic-ref the user gave checkout as argument.
   The command learned the "--no-recurse" option to stop after
   dereferencing a symbolic-ref only once.

 * "git branch --edit-description @{-1}" is now a way to edit branch
   description of the branch you were on before switching to the
   current branch.


Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.
--------------------------------------------------------------

 * With a bit of header twiddling, use the native regexp library on
   macOS instead of the compat/ one.

 * Prepare for GNU [ef]grep that throw warning of their uses.

 * Sources related to fuzz testing have been moved down to their own
   directory.

 * Most credential helpers ignored unknown entries in a credential
   description, but a few died upon seeing them.  The latter were
   taught to ignore them, too

 * "scalar unregister" in a repository that is already been
   unregistered reported an error.

 * Remove error detection from a function that fetches from promisor
   remotes, and make it die when such a fetch fails to bring all the
   requested objects, to give an early failure to various operations.

 * Update CodingGuidelines to clarify what features to use and avoid
   in C99.
   (merge 438c2f859b ab/coding-guidelines-c99 later to maint).

 * Avoid false-positive from LSan whose assumption may be broken with
   higher optimization levels.

 * Enable address and undefined sanitizer tasks at GitHub Actions CI.


Fixes since v2.38
-----------------

 * The codepath that reads from the index v4 had unaligned memory
   accesses, which has been corrected.
   (merge 4a6ed30f96 vd/fix-unaligned-read-index-v4 later to maint).

 * Fix messages incorrectly marked for translation.
   (merge 02cb8b9ee3 ah/fsmonitor-daemon-usage-non-l10n later to maint).

 * "git fsck" failed to release contents of tree objects already used
   from the memory, which has been fixed.
   (merge 51b27747e5 jk/fsck-on-diet later to maint).

 * "git clone" did not like to see the "--bare" and the "--origin"
   options used together without a good reason.
   (merge 3b910d6e29 jk/clone-allow-bare-and-o-together later to maint).

 * "git remote rename" failed to rename a remote without fetch
   refspec, which has been corrected.
   (merge 5a97b38109 jk/remote-rename-without-fetch-refspec later to maint).

 * Documentation on various Boolean GIT_* environment variables have
   been clarified.
   (merge 819fb68222 jc/environ-docs later to maint).

 * "git rebase -i" can mistakenly attempt to apply a fixup to a commit
   itself, which has been corrected.
   (merge 3e367a5f2f ja/rebase-i-avoid-amending-self later to maint).

 * "git multi-pack-index repack/expire" used to repack unreachable
   cruft into a new pack, which have been corrected.
   (merge b62ad5681f tb/midx-repack-ignore-cruft-packs later to maint).

 * In read-only repositories, "git merge-tree" tried to come up with a
   merge result tree object, which it failed (which is not wrong) and
   led to a segfault (which is bad), which has been corrected.
   (merge 92481d1b26 js/merge-ort-in-read-only-repo later to maint).

 * Force C locale while running tests around httpd to make sure we can
   find expected error messages in the log.
   (merge 7a2d8ea47e rs/test-httpd-in-C-locale later to maint).

 * Fix a logic in "mailinfo -b" that miscomputed the length of a
   substring, which lead to an out-of-bounds access.
   (merge 3ef1494685 pw/mailinfo-b-fix later to maint).

 * The codepath to sign learned to report errors when it fails to read
   from "ssh-keygen".
   (merge 36fb0d07d8 pw/ssh-sign-report-errors later to maint).

 * Code clean-up that results in plugging a leak.
   (merge 246526d019 rs/bisect-start-leakfix later to maint).

 * "GIT_EDITOR=: git branch --edit-description" resulted in failure,
   which has been corrected.
   (merge e288b3de35 jc/branch-description-unset later to maint).

 * The code to clean temporary object directories (used for
   quarantine) tried to remove them inside its signal handler, which
   was a no-no.
   (merge 22613b25ec jc/tmp-objdir later to maint).

 * Update comment in the Makefile about the RUNTIME_PREFIX config knob.
   (merge ebb6c16607 dd/document-runtime-prefix-better later to maint).

 * Clarify that "the sentence after <area>: prefix does not begin with
   a capital letter" rule applies only to the commit title.
   (merge 3991bb73dd jc/use-of-uc-in-log-messages later to maint).

 * "git branch --edit-description" on an unborh branch misleadingly
   said that no such branch exists, which has been corrected.
   (merge bcfc82bd48 rj/branch-edit-desc-unborn later to maint).

 * Work around older clang that warns against C99 zero initialization
   syntax for struct.
   (merge 54795d37d9 jh/struct-zero-init-with-older-clang later to maint).

 * Giving "--invert-grep" and "--all-match" without "--grep" to the
   "git log" command resulted in an attempt to access grep pattern
   expression structure that has not been allocated, which has been
   corrected.
   (merge db84376f98 ab/grep-simplify-extended-expression later to maint).

 * "git diff rev^!" did not show combined diff to go to the rev from
   its parents.
   (merge a79c6b6081 rs/diff-caret-bang-with-parents later to maint).

 * Allow configuration files in "protected" scopes to include other
   configuration files.
   (merge ecec57b3c9 gc/bare-repo-discovery later to maint).

 * Give a bit more diversity to macOS CI by using sha1dc in one of the
   jobs (the other one tests Apple Common Crypto).
   (merge 1ad5c3df35 jc/ci-osx-with-sha1dc later to maint).

 * Other code cleanup, docfix, build fix, etc.
