Git 2.22.1 Release Notes
========================

Fixes since v2.22
-----------------

 * A relative pathname given to "but init --template=<path> <repo>"
   ought to be relative to the directory "but init" gets invoked in,
   but it instead was made relative to the repository, which has been
   corrected.

 * "but worktree add" used to fail when another worktree connected to
   the same repository was corrupt, which has been corrected.

 * The ownership rule for the file descriptor to fast-import remote
   backend was mixed up, leading to unrelated file descriptor getting
   closed, which has been fixed.

 * "but update-server-info" used to leave stale packfiles in its
   output, which has been corrected.

 * The server side support for "but fetch" used to show incorrect
   value for the HEAD symbolic ref when the namespace feature is in
   use, which has been corrected.

 * "but am -i --resolved" segfaulted after trying to see a cummit as
   if it were a tree, which has been corrected.

 * "but bundle verify" needs to see if prerequisite objects exist in
   the receiving repository, but the command did not check if we are
   in a repository upfront, which has been corrected.

 * "but merge --squash" is designed to update the working tree and the
   index without creating the cummit, and this cannot be countermanded
   by adding the "--cummit" option; the command now refuses to work
   when both options are given.

 * The data collected by fsmonitor was not properly written back to
   the on-disk index file, breaking t7519 tests occasionally, which
   has been corrected.

 * Update to Unicode 12.1 width table.

 * The command line to invoke a "but cat-file" command from inside
   "but p4" was not properly quoted to protect a caret and running a
   broken command on Windows, which has been corrected.

 * "but request-pull" learned to warn when the ref we ask them to pull
   from in the local repository and in the published repository are
   different.

 * When creating a partial clone, the object filtering criteria is
   recorded for the origin of the clone, but this incorrectly used a
   hardcoded name "origin" to name that remote; it has been corrected
   to honor the "--origin <name>" option.

 * "but fetch" into a lazy clone forgot to fetch base objects that are
   necessary to complete delta in a thin packfile, which has been
   corrected.

 * The filter_data used in the list-objects-filter (which manages a
   lazily sparse clone repository) did not use the dynamic array API
   correctly---'nr' is supposed to point at one past the last element
   of the array in use.  This has been corrected.

 * The description about slashes in butignore patterns (used to
   indicate things like "anchored to this level only" and "only
   matches directories") has been revamped.

 * The URL decoding code has been updated to avoid going past the end
   of the string while parsing %-<hex>-<hex> sequence.

 * The list of for-each like macros used by clang-format has been
   updated.

 * "but push --atomic" that goes over the transport-helper (namely,
   the smart http transport) failed to prevent refs to be pushed when
   it can locally tell that one of the ref update will fail without
   having to consult the other end, which has been corrected.

 * "but clean" silently skipped a path when it cannot lstat() it; now
   it gives a warning.

 * A codepath that reads from GPG for signed object verification read
   past the end of allocated buffer, which has been fixed.

 * "but rm" to resolve a conflicted path leaked an internal message
   "needs merge" before actually removing the path, which was
   confusing.  This has been corrected.

 * The "but clone" documentation refers to command line options in its
   description in the short form; they have been replaced with long
   forms to make them more recognisable.

 * The configuration variable rebase.rescheduleFailedExec should be
   effective only while running an interactive rebase and should not
   affect anything when running a non-interactive one, which was not
   the case.  This has been corrected.

 * "but submodule foreach" did not protect command line options passed
   to the command to be run in each submodule correctly, when the
   "--recursive" option was in use.

 * Use "Erase in Line" CSI sequence that is already used in the editor
   support to clear cruft in the progress output.

 * The codepath to compute delta islands used to spew progress output
   without giving the callers any way to squelch it, which has been
   fixed.

 * The code to parse scaled numbers out of configuration files has
   been made more robust and also easier to follow.

 * An incorrect list of options was cached after command line
   completion failed (e.g. trying to complete a command that requires
   a repository outside one), which has been corrected.

 * "but rebase --abort" used to leave refs/rewritten/ when concluding
   "but rebase -r", which has been corrected.

 * "but stash show 23" used to work, but no more after getting
   rewritten in C; this regression has been corrected.

 * "but interpret-trailers" always treated '#' as the comment
   character, regardless of core.commentChar setting, which has been
   corrected.

 * Code clean-up to avoid signed integer overlaps during binary search.

 * "but checkout -p" needs to selectively apply a patch in reverse,
   which did not work well.

 * The cummit-graph file is now part of the "files that the runtime
   may keep open file descriptors on, all of which would need to be
   closed when done with the object store", and the file descriptor to
   an existing cummit-graph file now is closed before "gc" finalizes a
   new instance to replace it.

 * Code restructuring during 2.20 period broke fetching tags via
   "import" based transports.

 * We have been trying out a few language features outside c89; the
   coding guidelines document did not talk about them and instead had
   a blanket ban against them.

 * The internal diff machinery can be made to read out of bounds while
   looking for --funcion-context line in a corner case, which has been
   corrected.

Also contains various documentation updates, code clean-ups and minor fixups.
