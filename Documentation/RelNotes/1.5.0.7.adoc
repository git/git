GIT v1.5.0.7 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.5.0.6
--------------------

* Bugfixes

  - git-upload-pack failed to close unused pipe ends, resulting
    in many zombies to hang around.

  - git-rerere was recording the contents of earlier hunks
    duplicated in later hunks.  This prevented resolving the same
    conflict when performing the same merge the other way around.

* Documentation

  - a few documentation fixes from Debian package maintainer.
