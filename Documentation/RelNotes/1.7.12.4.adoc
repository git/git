Git 1.7.12.4 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.7.12.3
---------------------

 * "git fetch" over the dumb-http revision walker could segfault when
   curl's multi interface was used.

 * It was possible to give specific paths for "asciidoc" and other
   tools in the documentation toolchain, but not for "xmlto".

 * "gitweb" did not give the correct committer timezone in its feed
   output due to a typo.

 * The "-Xours" (and similarly -Xtheirs) backend option to "git
   merge -s recursive" was ignored for binary files.  Now it is
   honored.

 * The "binary" synthetic attribute made "diff" to treat the path as
   binary, but not "merge".

Also contains many documentation updates.
