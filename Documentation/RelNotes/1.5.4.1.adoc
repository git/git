GIT v1.5.4.1 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.5.4
------------------

 * "git-commit -C $tag" used to work but rewrite in C done in
   1.5.4 broke it.

 * An entry in the .gitattributes file that names a pattern in a
   subdirectory of the directory it is in did not match
   correctly (e.g. pattern "b/*.c" in "a/.gitattributes" should
   match "a/b/foo.c" but it didn't).

 * Customized color specification was parsed incorrectly when
   numeric color values are used.  This was fixed in 1.5.4.1.
