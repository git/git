Git v1.7.6.3 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.7.6.2
--------------------

 * "git -c var=value subcmd" misparsed the custom configuration when
   value contained an equal sign.

 * "git fetch" had a major performance regression, wasting many
   needless cycles in a repository where there is no submodules
   present. This was especially bad, when there were many refs.

 * "git reflog $refname" did not default to the "show" subcommand as
   the documentation advertised the command to do.

 * "git reset" did not leave meaningful log message in the reflog.

 * "git status --ignored" did not show ignored items when there is no
   untracked items.

 * "git tag --contains $commit" was unnecessarily inefficient.

Also contains minor fixes and documentation updates.
