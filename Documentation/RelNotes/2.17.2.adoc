Git v2.17.2 Release Notes
=========================

This release merges up the fixes that appear in v2.14.5 to address
the recently reported CVE-2018-17456; see the release notes for that
version for details.

In addition, this release also teaches "fsck" and the server side
logic to reject pushes to repositories that attempt to create such a
problematic ".gitmodules" file as tracked contents, to help hosting
sites protect their customers by preventing malicious contents from
spreading.
