Git v2.1.3 Release Notes
========================

 * Some MUAs mangled a line in a message that begins with "From " to
   ">From " when writing to a mailbox file and feeding such an input to
   "git am" used to lose such a line.

 * "git daemon" (with NO_IPV6 build configuration) used to incorrectly
   use the hostname even when gethostbyname() reported that the given
   hostname is not found.

 * Newer versions of 'meld' breaks the auto-detection we use to see if
   they are new enough to support the `--output` option.

 * "git pack-objects" forgot to disable the codepath to generate
   object reachability bitmap when it needs to split the resulting
   pack.

 * "gitweb" used deprecated CGI::startfrom, which was removed from
   CGI.pm as of 4.04; use CGI::start_from instead.

 * "git log" documentation had an example section marked up not
   quite correctly, which passed AsciiDoc but failed with
   AsciiDoctor.

Also contains some documentation updates.
