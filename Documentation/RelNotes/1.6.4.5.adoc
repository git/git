Git v1.6.4.5 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.6.4.4
--------------------

 * Simplified base85 implementation.

 * An overlong line after ".gitdir: " in a git file caused out of bounds
   access to an array on the stack.

 * "git count-objects" did not handle packs larger than 4G.

 * "git rev-parse --parseopt --stop-at-non-option" did not stop at non option
   when --keep-dashdash was in effect.

 * "gitweb" can sometimes be tricked into parrotting a filename argument
   given in a request without properly quoting.

Other minor fixes and documentation updates are included.
