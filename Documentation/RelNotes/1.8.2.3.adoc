Git v1.8.2.3 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.8.2.2
--------------------

 * "rev-list --stdin" and friends kept bogus pointers into the input
   buffer around as human readable object names.  This was not a
   huge problem but was exposed by a new change that uses these
   names in error output.

 * When "git difftool" drove "kdiff3", it mistakenly passed --auto
   option that was meant while resolving merge conflicts.

 * "git remote add" command did not diagnose extra command line
   arguments as an error and silently ignored them.

Also contains a handful of trivial code clean-ups, documentation
updates, updates to the test suite, etc.
