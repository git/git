Git v1.7.4.1 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.7.4
------------------

 * On Windows platform, the codepath to spawn a new child process forgot
   to first flush the output buffer.

 * "git bundle" did not use OFS_DELTA encoding, making its output a few
   per-cent larger than necessarily.

 * The option to tell "git clone" to recurse into the submodules was
   misspelled with an underscore "--recurse_submodules".

 * "git diff --cached HEAD" before the first commit does what an end user
   would expect (namely, show what would be committed without further "git
   add").

 * "git fast-import" didn't accept the command to ask for "notes" feature
   to be present in its input stream, even though it was capable of the
   feature.

 * "git fsck" gave up scanning loose object files in directories with
   garbage files.

And other minor fixes and documentation updates.
