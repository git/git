Git v2.4.8 Release Notes
========================

Fixes since v2.4.7
------------------

 * Abandoning an already applied change in "git rebase -i" with
   "--continue" left CHERRY_PICK_HEAD and confused later steps.

 * Various fixes around "git am" that applies a patch to a history
   that is not there yet.

 * "git for-each-ref" reported "missing object" for 0{40} when it
   encounters a broken ref.  The lack of object whose name is 0{40} is
   not the problem; the ref being broken is.

 * "git commit --cleanup=scissors" was not careful enough to protect
   against getting fooled by a line that looked like scissors.

Also contains typofixes, documentation updates and trivial code
clean-ups.
