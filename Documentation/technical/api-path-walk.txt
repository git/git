Path-Walk API
=============

The path-walk API is used to walk reachable objects, but to visit objects
in batches based on a common path they appear in, or by type.

For example, all reachable commits are visited in a group. All tags are
visited in a group. Then, all root trees are visited. At some point, all
blobs reachable via a path `my/dir/to/A` are visited. When there are
multiple paths possible to reach the same object, then only one of those
paths is used to visit the object.

When walking a range of commits with some `UNINTERESTING` objects, the
objects with the `UNINTERESTING` flag are included in these batches. In
order to walk `UNINTERESTING` objects, the `--boundary` option must be
used in the commit walk in order to visit `UNINTERESTING` commits.

Basics
------

To use the path-walk API, include `path-walk.h` and call
`walk_objects_by_path()` with a customized `path_walk_info` struct. The
struct is used to set all of the options for how the walk should proceed.
Let's dig into the different options and their use.

`path_fn` and `path_fn_data`::
	The most important option is the `path_fn` option, which is a
	function pointer to the callback that can execute logic on the
	object IDs for objects grouped by type and path. This function
	also receives a `data` value that corresponds to the
	`path_fn_data` member, for providing custom data structures to
	this callback function.

`revs`::
	To configure the exact details of the reachable set of objects,
	use the `revs` member and initialize it using the revision
	machinery in `revision.h`. Initialize `revs` using calls such as
	`setup_revisions()` or `parse_revision_opt()`. Do not call
	`prepare_revision_walk()`, as that will be called within
	`walk_objects_by_path()`.
+
It is also important that you do not specify the `--objects` flag for the
`revs` struct. The revision walk should only be used to walk commits, and
the objects will be walked in a separate way based on those starting
commits.
+
If you want the path-walk API to emit `UNINTERESTING` objects based on the
commit walk's boundary, be sure to set `revs.boundary` so the boundary
commits are emitted.

`commits`, `blobs`, `trees`::
	By default, these members are enabled and signal that the path-walk
	API should call the `path_fn` on objects of these types. Specialized
	applications could disable some options to make it simpler to walk
	the objects or to have fewer calls to `path_fn`.
+
While it is possible to walk only commits in this way, consumers would be
better off using the revision walk API instead.
