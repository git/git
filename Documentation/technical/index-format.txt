GIT index format
================

= The git index file has the following format

  All binary numbers are in network byte order. Version 2 is described
  here unless stated otherwise.

   - A 12-byte header consisting of

     4-byte signature:
       The signature is { 'D', 'I', 'R', 'C' }

     4-byte version number:
       The current supported versions are 2 and 3.

     32-bit number of index entries.

   - A number of sorted index entries

   - Extensions

     Extensions are identified by signature. Optional extensions can
     be ignored if GIT does not understand them.

     GIT currently supports tree cache and resolve undo extensions.

     4-byte extension signature. If the first byte is 'A'..'Z' the
     extension is optional and can be ignored.

     32-bit size of the extension

     Extension data

   - 160-bit SHA-1 over the content of the index file before this
     checksum.

== Index entry

  Index entries are sorted in ascending order on the name field,
  interpreted as a string of unsigned bytes. Entries with the same
  name are sorted by their stage field.

  32-bit ctime seconds, the last time a file's metadata changed
    this is stat(2) data

  32-bit ctime nanosecond fractions
    this is stat(2) data

  32-bit mtime seconds, the last time a file's data changed
    this is stat(2) data

  32-bit mtime nanosecond fractions
    this is stat(2) data

  32-bit dev
    this is stat(2) data

  32-bit ino
    this is stat(2) data

  32-bit mode, split into (high to low bits)

    4-bit object type
      valid values in binary are 1000 (blob), 1010 (symbolic link)
      and 1110 (gitlink)

    3-bit unused

    9-bit unix permission (only 0755 and 0644 are valid)

  32-bit uid
    this is stat(2) data

  32-bit gid
    this is stat(2) data

  32-bit file size
    This is the on-disk size from stat(2)

  160-bit SHA-1 for the represented object

  A 16-bit field split into (high to low bits)

    1-bit assume-valid flag

    1-bit extended flag (must be zero in version 2)

    2-bit stage (during merge)

    12-bit name length if the length is less than 0x0FFF

  (Version 3) A 16-bit field, only applicable if the "extended flag"
  above is 1, split into (high to low bits).

    1-bit reserved for future

    1-bit skip-worktree flag (used by sparse checkout)

    1-bit intent-to-add flag (used by "git add -N")

    13-bit unused, must be zero

  Entry path name (variable length) relative to top level directory
    (without leading slash). '/' is used as path separator. The special
    paths ".", ".." and ".git" (without quotes) are disallowed.
    Trailing slash is also disallowed.

    The exact encoding is undefined, but the '.' and '/' characters
    are encoded in 7-bit ASCII and the encoding cannot contain a nul
    byte. Generally a superset of ASCII.

  1-8 nul bytes as necessary to pad the entry to a multiple of eight bytes
  while keeping the name NUL-terminated.

== Extensions

=== Tree cache

  Tree cache extension contains pre-computed hashes for trees that can
  be derived from the index. It helps speed up tree object generation
  from index for a new commit.

  When a path is updated in index, the path must be invalidated and
  removed from tree cache.

  - Extension tag { 'T', 'R', 'E', 'E' }

  - 32-bit size

  - A number of entries

     NUL-terminated tree name

     Blank-terminated ASCII decimal number of entries in this tree

     Newline-terminated position of this tree in the parent tree. 0 for
     the root tree

     160-bit SHA-1 for this tree and it's children

=== Resolve undo

  A conflict is represented in index as a set of higher stage entries.
  When a conflict is resolved (e.g. with "git add path"), these higher
  stage entries will be removed and a stage-0 entry with proper
  resoluton is added.

  Resolve undo extension saves these higher stage entries so that
  conflicts can be recreated (e.g. with "git checkout -m"), in case
  users want to redo a conflict resolution from scratch.

  - Extension tag { 'R', 'E', 'U', 'C' }

  - 32-bit size

  - A number of conflict entries

    NUL-terminated conflict path

    Three NUL-terminated ASCII octal numbers, entry mode of entries in
    stage 1 to 3.

    At most three 160-bit SHA-1s of the entry in three stages from 1
    to 3. SHA-1 is not saved for any stage with entry mode zero.
