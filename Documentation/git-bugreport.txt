NAME
----
git-bugreport - Collect information for user to file a bug report

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git bugreport' [(-o | --output-directory) <path>] [(-s | --suffix) <format>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Captures information about the user's machine, Git client, and repository state,
as well as a form requesting information about the behavior the user observed,
into a single text file which the user can then share, for example to the Git
mailing list, in order to report an observed bug.

The following information is requested from the user:

 - Reproduction steps
 - Expected behavior
 - Actual behavior

The following information is captured automatically:

 - 'git version --build-options'
 - uname sysname, release, version, and machine strings
 - Compiler-specific info string
 - A list of enabled hooks
 - $SHELL

This tool is invoked via the typical Git setup process, which means that in some
cases, it might not be able to launch - for example, if a relevant config file
is unreadable. In this kind of scenario, it may be helpful to manually gather
the kind of information listed above when manually asking for help.

OPTIONS
-------
-o <path>::
--output-directory <path>::
	Place the resulting bug report file in `<path>` instead of the current
	directory.

-s <format>::
--suffix <format>::
	Specify an alternate suffix for the bugreport name, to create a file
	named 'git-bugreport-<formatted suffix>'. This should take the form of a
	strftime(3) format string; the current local time will be used.
