NAME

git-notes - Add/inspect object notes

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git notes' [list [<object>]]
'git notes' add [-f] [-F <file> | -m <msg> | (-c | -C) <object>] [<object>]
'git notes' copy [-f] <from-object> <to-object>
'git notes' append [-F <file> | -m <msg> | (-c | -C) <object>] [<object>]
'git notes' edit [<object>]
'git notes' show [<object>]
'git notes' remove [<object>]
'git notes' prune


DESCRIPTION
-----------
This command allows you to add/remove notes to/from objects, without
changing the objects themselves.

A typical use of notes is to extend a commit message without having
to change the commit itself. Such commit notes can be shown by `git log`
along with the original commit message. To discern these notes from the
message stored in the commit object, the notes are indented like the
message, after an unindented line saying "Notes:".

To disable notes, you have to set the config variable core.notesRef to
the empty string.  Alternatively, you can set it to a different ref,
something like "refs/notes/bugzilla".  This setting can be overridden
by the environment variable "GIT_NOTES_REF".


SUBCOMMANDS
-----------

list::
	List the notes object for a given object. If no object is
	given, show a list of all note objects and the objects they
	annotate (in the format "<note object> <annotated object>").
	This is the default subcommand if no subcommand is given.

add::
	Add notes for a given object (defaults to HEAD). Abort if the
	object already has notes (use `-f` to overwrite an
	existing note).

copy::
	Copy the notes for the first object onto the second object.
	Abort if the second object already has notes, or if the first
	object has none (use -f to overwrite existing notes to the
	second object). This subcommand is equivalent to:
	`git notes add [-f] -C $(git notes list <from-object>) <to-object>`

append::
	Append to the notes of an existing object (defaults to HEAD).
	Creates a new notes object if needed.

edit::
	Edit the notes for a given object (defaults to HEAD).

show::
	Show the notes for a given object (defaults to HEAD).

remove::
	Remove the notes for a given object (defaults to HEAD).
	This is equivalent to specifying an empty note message to
	the `edit` subcommand.

prune::
	Remove all notes for non-existing/unreachable objects.

OPTIONS
-------
-f::
--force::
	When adding notes to an object that already has notes,
	overwrite the existing notes (instead of aborting).

-m <msg>::
--message=<msg>::
	Use the given note message (instead of prompting).
	If multiple `-m` options are given, their values
	are concatenated as separate paragraphs.

-F <file>::
--file=<file>::
	Take the note message from the given file.  Use '-' to
	read the note message from the standard input.

-C <object>::
--reuse-message=<object>::
	Reuse the note message from the given note object.

-c <object>::
--reedit-message=<object>::
	Like '-C', but with '-c' the editor is invoked, so that
	the user can further edit the note message.
