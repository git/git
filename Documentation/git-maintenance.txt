NAME
----
git-maintenance - Run tasks to optimize Git repository data


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git maintenance' run [<options>]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Run tasks to optimize Git repository data, speeding up other Git commands
and reducing storage requirements for the repository.
+
Git commands that add repository data, such as `git add` or `git fetch`,
are optimized for a responsive user experience. These commands do not take
time to optimize the Git data, since such optimizations scale with the full
size of the repository while these user commands each perform a relatively
small action.
+
The `git maintenance` command provides flexibility for how to optimize the
Git repository.

SUBCOMMANDS
-----------

run::
	Run one or more maintenance tasks.

TASKS
-----

commit-graph::
	The `commit-graph` job updates the `commit-graph` files incrementally,
	then verifies that the written data is correct. If the new layer has an
	issue, then the chain file is removed and the `commit-graph` is
	rewritten from scratch.
+
The verification only checks the top layer of the `commit-graph` chain.
If the incremental write merged the new commits with at least one
existing layer, then there is potential for on-disk corruption being
carried forward into the new file. This will be noticed and the new
commit-graph file will be clean as Git reparses the commit data from
the object database.
+
The incremental write is safe to run alongside concurrent Git processes
since it will not expire `.graph` files that were in the previous
`commit-graph-chain` file. They will be deleted by a later run based on
the expiration delay.

gc::
	Cleanup unnecessary files and optimize the local repository. "GC"
	stands for "garbage collection," but this task performs many
	smaller tasks. This task can be rather expensive for large
	repositories, as it repacks all Git objects into a single pack-file.
	It can also be disruptive in some situations, as it deletes stale
	data.

OPTIONS
-------
--auto::
	When combined with the `run` subcommand, run maintenance tasks
	only if certain thresholds are met. For example, the `gc` task
	runs when the number of loose objects exceeds the number stored
	in the `gc.auto` config setting, or when the number of pack-files
	exceeds the `gc.autoPackLimit` config setting.

--quiet::
	Do not report progress or other information over `stderr`.
