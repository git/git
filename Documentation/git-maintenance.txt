NAME
----
git-maintenance - Run tasks to optimize Git repository data


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git maintenance' run [<options>]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Run tasks to optimize Git repository data, speeding up other Git commands
and reducing storage requirements for the repository.

Git commands that add repository data, such as `git add` or `git fetch`,
are optimized for a responsive user experience. These commands do not take
time to optimize the Git data, since such optimizations scale with the full
size of the repository while these user commands each perform a relatively
small action.

The `git maintenance` command provides flexibility for how to optimize the
Git repository.

SUBCOMMANDS
-----------

run::
	Run one or more maintenance tasks.

TASKS
-----

gc::
	Clean up unnecessary files and optimize the local repository. "GC"
	stands for "garbage collection," but this task performs many
	smaller tasks. This task can be expensive for large repositories,
	as it repacks all Git objects into a single pack-file. It can also
	be disruptive in some situations, as it deletes stale data. See
	linkgit:git-gc[1] for more details on garbage collection in Git.

OPTIONS
-------
--auto::
	When combined with the `run` subcommand, run maintenance tasks
	only if certain thresholds are met. For example, the `gc` task
	runs when the number of loose objects exceeds the number stored
	in the `gc.auto` config setting, or when the number of pack-files
	exceeds the `gc.autoPackLimit` config setting.
