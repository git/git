git-status-script(1)
====================
v0.99.4, Aug 2005

NAME
----
git-status-script - Show working tree status.


SYNOPSIS
--------
'git status'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Examines paths in the working tree that has changes unrecorded
to the index file, and changes between the index file and the
current HEAD commit.  The former paths are what you _could_
commit by running 'git-update-cache' before running 'git
commit', and the latter paths are what you _would_ commit by
running 'git commit'.

If there is no path that is different between the index file and
the current HEAD commit, the command exits with non-zero
status.


OUTPUT
------
The output from this command is designed to be used as a commit
template comments, and all the output lines are prefixed with '#'.
