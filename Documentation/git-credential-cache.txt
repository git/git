git-credential-cache(1)
=======================

NAME
----
git-credential-cache - helper to temporarily store passwords in memory

SYNOPSIS
--------
-----------------------------
git config credential.helper 'cache [options]'
-----------------------------

DESCRIPTION
-----------

This command requests credentials from the user and caches them in
memory for use by future git programs. The stored credentials never
touch the disk, and are forgotten after a configurable timeout.  The
cache is accessible over a Unix domain socket, restricted to the current
user by filesystem permissions.

You probably don't want to invoke this command directly; it is meant to
be used as a credential helper by other parts of git. See
linkgit:gitcredentials[7] or `EXAMPLES` below.

OPTIONS
-------

--timeout::

	Number of seconds to cache credentials (default: 900).

--socket <path>::

	Use `<path>` to contact a running cache daemon (or start a new
	cache daemon if one is not started). Defaults to
	`~/.git-credential-cache/socket`. If your home directory is on a
	network-mounted filesystem, you may need to change this to a
	local filesystem.

--chain <helper>::

	Specify an external helper to use for retrieving credentials
	from the user, instead of the default method. The resulting
	credentials are then cached as normal. This option can be
	given multiple times; each chained helper will be tried until
	credentials are received.

--exit::

	Tell a running daemon to exit, forgetting all cached
	credentials.

Git may provide other options to the program when it is called as a
credential helper; see linkgit:gitcredentials[7].

EXAMPLES
--------

The point of this helper is to reduce the number of times you must type
your username or password. For example:

------------------------------------
$ git config credential.helper cache
$ git push http://example.com/repo.git
Username: <type your username>
Password: <type your password>

[work for 5 more minutes]
$ git push http://example.com/repo.git
[your credentials are used automatically]
------------------------------------

You can provide options via the credential.helper configuration
variable (this example drops the cache time to 5 minutes):

------------------------------------
$ git config credential.helper 'cache --timeout=300'
