git-mktag(1)
============

NAME
----
git-mktag - Creates a tag object


SYNOPSIS
--------
'git-mktag' < signature_file

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Reads a tag contents on standard input and creates a tag object
that can also be used to sign other objects.

The output is the new tag's <object> identifier.

Tag Format
----------
A tag signature file has a very simple fixed format: four lines of

  object <sha1>
  type <typename>
  tag <tagname>
  tagger <tagger>

followed by some 'optional' free-form message (some tags created
by older git may not have `tagger` line).  The message, when
exists, is separated by a blank line from the header.  The
message part may contain a signature that git itself doesn't
care about, but that can be verified with gpg.
