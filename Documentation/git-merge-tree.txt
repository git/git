git-merge-tree(1)
=================

NAME
----
git-merge-tree - Show three-way merge without touching index


SYNOPSIS
--------
'git-merge-tree' <base-tree> <branch1> <branch2>

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Reads three treeish, and output trivial merge results and
conflicting stages to the standard output.  This is similar to
what three-way read-tree -m does, but instead of storing the
results in the index, the command outputs the entries to the
standard output.

This is meant to be used by higher level scripts to compute
merge results outside index, and stuff the results back into the
index.  For this reason, the output from the command omits
entries that match <branch1> tree.
