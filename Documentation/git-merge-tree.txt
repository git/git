git-merge-tree(1)
=================

NAME
----
git-merge-tree - Perform merge without touching index or working tree


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git merge-tree' [--write-tree] [<options>] <branch1> <branch2>
'git merge-tree' [--trivial-merge] <base-tree> <branch1> <branch2> (deprecated)

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Performs a merge, but does not make any new commits and does not read
from or write to either the working tree or index.

The second form is deprecated and supported only for backward
compatibility.  It will likely be removed in the future, and will not
be discussed further in this manual.

The first form will merge the two branches, doing a real merge.  A real
merge is distinguished from a trivial merge in that it includes:

  * three way content merges of individual files
  * rename detection
  * proper directory/file conflict handling
  * recursive ancestor consolidation (i.e. when there is more than one
    merge base, creating a virtual merge base by merging the merge bases)
  * etc.

After the merge completes, it will create a new toplevel tree object.
See `OUTPUT` below for details.

OPTIONS
-------

--[no-]messages::
	Write any informational messages such as "Auto-merging <path>"
	or CONFLICT notices to the end of stdout.  If unspecified, the
	default is to include these messages if there are merge
	conflicts, and to omit them otherwise.

OUTPUT
------

By default, for a successful merge, the output from git-merge-tree is
simply one line:

	<OID of toplevel tree>

Whereas for a conflicted merge, the output is by default of the form:

	<OID of toplevel tree>
	<Informational messages>

These are discussed individually below.

OID of toplevel tree
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a tree object that represents what would be checked out in the
working tree at the end of `git merge`.  If there were conflicts, then
files within this tree may have embedded conflict markers.

Informational messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This always starts with a blank line to separate it from the previous
section, and then has free-form messages about the merge, such as:

  * "Auto-merging <file>"
  * "CONFLICT (rename/delete): <oldfile> renamed...but deleted in..."
  * "Failed to merge submodule <submodule> (<reason>)"
  * "Warning: cannot merge binary files: <filename>"

EXIT STATUS
-----------

For a successful, non-conflicted merge, the exit status is 0.  When the
merge has conflicts, the exit status is 1.  If the merge is not able to
complete (or start) due to some kind of error, the exit status is
something other than 0 or 1.

USAGE NOTES
-----------

git-merge-tree was written to be low-level plumbing, similar to
hash-object, mktree, commit-tree, update-ref, and mktag.  Thus, it could
be used as a part of a series of steps such as

       NEWTREE=$(git merge-tree --write-tree $BRANCH1 $BRANCH2)
       test $? -eq 0 || die "There were conflicts..."
       NEWCOMMIT=$(git commit-tree $NEWTREE -p $BRANCH1 -p $BRANCH2)
       git update-ref $BRANCH1 $NEWCOMMIT

However, it does not quite fit into the same category of low-level
plumbing commands since the possibility of merge conflicts give it a
much higher chance of the command not succeeding (and NEWTREE containing
a bunch of stuff other than just a toplevel tree).
