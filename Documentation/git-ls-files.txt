NAME
----
git-ls-files - Information about files in the cache/working directory


SYNOPSIS
--------
'git-ls-files' [-z] [-t]
		(--[cached|deleted|others|ignored|stage|unmerged])\*
		(-[c|d|o|i|s|u])\*
		[-x <pattern>|--exclude=<pattern>]
		[-X <file>|--exclude-from=<file>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This merges the file listing in the directory cache index with the
actual working directory list, and shows different combinations of the
two.

One or more of the options below may be used to determine the files
shown:

OPTIONS
-------
-c|--cached::
	Show cached files in the output (default)

-d|--deleted::
	Show deleted files in the output

-o|--others::
	Show other files in the output

-i|--ignored::
	Show ignored files in the output
	Note the this also reverses any exclude list present.

-s|--stage::
	Show stage files in the output

-u|--unmerged::
	Show unmerged files in the output (forces --stage)

-z::
	\0 line termination on output

-x|--exclude=<pattern>::
	Skips files matching pattern.
	Note that pattern is a shell wildcard pattern.

-X|--exclude-from=<file>::
	exclude patterns are read from <file>; 1 per line.
	Allows the use of the famous dontdiff file as follows to find
	out about uncommitted files just as dontdiff is used with
	the diff command:
	     git-ls-files --others --exclude-from=dontdiff

-t::
	Identify the file status with the following tags (followed by
	a space) at the start of each line:
	H	cached
	M	unmerged
	R	removed/deleted
	?	other

Output
------
show files just outputs the filename unless '--stage' is specified in
which case it outputs:

        [<tag> ]<mode> <object> <stage> <file>

"git-ls-files --unmerged" and "git-ls-files --stage" can be used to examine
detailed information on unmerged paths.

For an unmerged path, instead of recording a single mode/SHA1 pair,
the dircache records up to three such pairs; one from tree O in stage
1, A in stage 2, and B in stage 3.  This information can be used by
the user (or Cogito) to see what should eventually be recorded at the
path. (see read-cache for more information on state)
