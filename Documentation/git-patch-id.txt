git-patch-id(1)
===============

NAME
----
git-patch-id - Generate a patch ID.

SYNOPSIS
--------
'git-patch-id' < <patch>

DESCRIPTION
-----------
A "patch ID" is nothing but a SHA1 of the diff associated with a patch, with
whitespace and line numbers ignored.  As such, it's "reasonably stable", but at
the same time also reasonably unique, ie two patches that have the same "patch
ID" are almost guaranteed to be the same thing.

IOW, you can use this thing to look for likely duplicate commits.

OPTIONS
-------
<patch>::
	The diff to create the ID of.
