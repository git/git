git-submodule(1)
================

NAME
----
git-submodule - Initialize, update or inspect submodules


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git-submodule' [--quiet] [-b branch] add <repository> [<path>]
'git-submodule' [--quiet] [--cached] [status|init|update] [--] [<path>...]


COMMANDS
--------
add::
	Add the given repository as a submodule at the given path
	to the changeset to be committed next.  In particular, the
	repository is cloned at the specified path, added to the
	changeset and registered in .gitmodules.   If no path is
	specified, the path is deduced from the repository specification.
	If the repository url begins with ./ or ../, it is stored as
	given but resolved as a relative path from the main project's
	url when cloning.

status::
	Show the status of the submodules. This will print the SHA-1 of the
	currently checked out commit for each submodule, along with the
	submodule path and the output of gitlink:git-describe[1] for the
	SHA-1. Each SHA-1 will be prefixed with `-` if the submodule is not
	initialized and `+` if the currently checked out submodule commit
	does not match the SHA-1 found in the index of the containing
	repository. This command is the default command for git-submodule.

init::
	Initialize the submodules, i.e. register in .git/config each submodule
	name and url found in .gitmodules. The key used in .git/config is
	`submodule.$name.url`. This command does not alter existing information
	in .git/config.

update::
	Update the registered submodules, i.e. clone missing submodules and
	checkout the commit specified in the index of the containing repository.
	This will make the submodules HEAD be detached.


OPTIONS
-------
-q, --quiet::
	Only print error messages.

-b, --branch::
	Branch of repository to add as submodule.

--cached::
	Display the SHA-1 stored in the index, not the SHA-1 of the currently
	checked out submodule commit. This option is only valid for the
	status command.

<path>::
	Path to submodule(s). When specified this will restrict the command
	to only operate on the submodules found at the specified paths.

FILES
-----
When initializing submodules, a .gitmodules file in the top-level directory
of the containing repository is used to find the url of each submodule.
This file should be formatted in the same way as `$GIT_DIR/config`. The key
to each submodule url is "submodule.$name.url".  See gitlink:gitmodules[5]
for details.
