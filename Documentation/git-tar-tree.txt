git-tar-tree(1)
===============

NAME
----
git-tar-tree - Creates a tar archive of the files in the named tree


SYNOPSIS
--------
'git-tar-tree' <tree-ish> [ <base> ]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Creates a tar archive containing the tree structure for the named tree.
When <base> is specified it is added as a leading path to the files in the
generated tar archive.

git-tar-tree behaves differently when given a tree ID versus when given
a commit ID or tag ID.  In the first case the current time is used as
modification time of each file in the archive.  In the latter case the
commit time as recorded in the referenced commit object is used instead.
Additionally the commit ID is stored in a global extended pax header.
It can be extracted using git-get-tar-commit-id.
