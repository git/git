= Upcoming breaking changes

The Git project aims to ensure backwards compatibility to the best extent
possible. Minor releases will not break backwards compatibility unless there is
a very strong reason to do so, like for example a security vulnerability.

Regardless of that, due to the age of the Git project, it is only natural to
accumulate a backlog of backwards-incompatible changes that will eventually be
required to keep the project aligned with a changing world. These changes fall
into several categories:

* Changes to long established defaults.
* Concepts that have been replaced with a superior design.
* Concepts, commands, configuration or options that have been lacking in major
  ways and that cannot be fixed and which will thus be removed without any
  replacement.

Explicitly not included in this list are fixes to minor bugs that may cause a
change in user-visible behavior.

The Git project irregularly releases breaking versions that deliberately break
backwards compatibility with older versions. This is done to ensure that Git
remains relevant, safe and maintainable going forward. The release cadence of
breaking versions is typically measured in multiple years. We had the following
major breaking releases in the past:

* Git 1.6.0, released in August 2008.
* Git 2.0, released in May 2014.

We use <major>.<minor> release numbers these days, starting from Git 2.0. For
future releases, our plan is to increment <major> in the release number when we
make the next breaking release. Before Git 2.0, the release numbers were
1.<major>.<minor> with the intention to increment <major> for "usual" breaking
releases, reserving the jump to Git 2.0 for really large backward-compatibility
breaking changes.

The intent of this document is to track upcoming deprecations for future
breaking releases. Furthermore, this document also tracks what will _not_ be
deprecated. This is done such that the outcome of discussions document both
when the discussion favors deprecation, but also when it rejects a deprecation.

Items should have a clear summary of the reasons why we do or do not want to
make the described change that can be easily understood without having to read
the mailing list discussions. If there are alternatives to the changed feature,
those alternatives should be pointed out to our users.

All items should be accompanied by references to relevant mailing list threads
where the deprecation was discussed. These references use message-IDs, which
can visited via

  https://lore.kernel.org/git/$message_id/

to see the message and its surrounding discussion. Such a reference is there to
make it easier for you to find how the project reached consensus on the
described item back then.

This is a living document as the environment surrounding the project changes
over time. If circumstances change, an earlier decision to deprecate or change
something may need to be revisited from time to time. So do not take items on
this list to mean "it is settled, do not waste our time bringing it up again".

== Git 3.0

The following subsections document upcoming breaking changes for Git 3.0. There
is no planned release date for this breaking version yet.

Proposed changes and removals only include items which are "ready" to be done.
In other words, this is not supposed to be a wishlist of features that should
be changed to or replaced in case the alternative was implemented already.

=== Changes

=== Removals

== Superseded features that will not be deprecated

Some features have gained newer replacements that aim to improve the design in
certain ways. The fact that there is a replacement does not automatically mean
that the old way of doing things will eventually be removed. This section tracks
those features with newer alternatives.
