`--rerere-autoupdate`::
`--no-rerere-autoupdate`::
	After the rerere mechanism reuses a recorded resolution on
	the current conflict to update the files in the working
	tree, allow it to also update the index with the result of
	resolution.  `--no-rerere-autoupdate` is a good way to
	double-check what `rerere` did and catch potential
	mismerges, before committing the result to the index with a
	separate `git add`.
