git-last-modified(1)
====================

NAME
----
git-last-modified - EXPERIMENTAL: Show when files were last modified


SYNOPSIS
--------
[synopsis]
git last-modified [--recursive] [--show-trees] [-z]
		  [<revision-range>] [[--] <pathspec>...]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Shows which commit last modified each of the relevant files and subdirectories.
A commit renaming a path, or changing it's mode is also taken into account.

THIS COMMAND IS EXPERIMENTAL. THE BEHAVIOR MAY CHANGE.

OPTIONS
-------

`-r`::
`--recursive`::
	Instead of showing tree entries, step into subtrees and show all entries
	inside them recursively.

`-t`::
`--show-trees`::
	Show tree entries even when recursing into them. It has no effect
	without `--recursive`.

`-z`::
	Terminate each line with a _NUL_ character rather than a newline.

`<revision-range>`::
	Only traverse commits in the specified revision range. When no
	`<revision-range>` is specified, it defaults to `HEAD` (i.e. the whole
	history leading to the current commit). For a complete list of ways to
	spell `<revision-range>`, see the 'Specifying Ranges' section of
	linkgit:gitrevisions[7].

`[--] <pathspec>...`::
	Show the commit that last modified each path matching _<pathspec>_.
	If no _<pathspec>_ is given, all files and subdirectories are included.
	See linkgit:gitglossary[7] for details on pathspec syntax.

OUTPUT
------

The output is in the format:

------------
 <oid> TAB <path> LF
------------

If a path contains any special characters, the path is C-style quoted. To
avoid quoting, pass option `-z` to terminate each line with a NUL.

------------
 <oid> TAB <path> NUL
------------
