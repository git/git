git-check-files - Verify a list of files are up-to-date



SYNOPSIS
--------
'git-check-files' <file>...

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Check that a list of files are up-to-date between the filesystem and
the cache. Used to verify a patch target before doing a patch.

Files that do not exist on the filesystem are considered up-to-date
(whether or not they are in the cache).

Emits an error message on failure:

preparing to update existing file <file> not in cache::
	  <file> exists but is not in the cache

preparing to update file <file> not uptodate in cache::
	  <file> on disk is not up-to-date with the cache

Exits with a status code indicating success if all files are
up-to-date.
