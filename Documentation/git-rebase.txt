git-rebase(1)
=============

NAME
----
git-rebase - Rebase local commits to a new head

SYNOPSIS
--------
'git-rebase' [--onto <newbase>] <upstream> [<branch>]

'git-rebase' --continue | --skip | --abort

DESCRIPTION
-----------
git-rebase replaces <branch> with a new branch of the same name.  When
the --onto option is provided the new branch starts out with a HEAD equal
to <newbase>, otherwise it is equal to <upstream>.  It then attempts to
create a new commit for each commit from the original <branch> that does
not exist in the <upstream> branch.

It is possible that a merge failure will prevent this process from being
completely automatic.  You will have to resolve any such merge failure
and run `git rebase --continue`.  Another option is to bypass the commit
that caused the merge failure with `git rebase --skip`.  To restore the
original <branch> and remove the .dotest working files, use the command
`git rebase --abort` instead.

Note that if <branch> is not specified on the command line, the currently
checked out branch is used.

Assume the following history exists and the current branch is "topic":

------------
          A---B---C topic
         /
    D---E---F---G master
------------

From this point, the result of either of the following commands:


    git-rebase master
    git-rebase master topic

would be:

------------
                  A'--B'--C' topic
                 /
    D---E---F---G master
------------

While, starting from the same point, the result of either of the following
commands:

    git-rebase --onto master~1 master
    git-rebase --onto master~1 master topic

would be:

------------
              A'--B'--C' topic
             /
    D---E---F---G master
------------

In case of conflict, git-rebase will stop at the first problematic commit
and leave conflict markers in the tree.  You can use git diff to locate
the markers (<<<<<<) and make edits to resolve the conflict.  For each
file you edit, you need to tell git that the conflict has been resolved,
typically this would be done with


    git update-index <filename>


After resolving the conflict manually and updating the index with the
desired resolution, you can continue the rebasing process with


    git rebase --continue


Alternatively, you can undo the git-rebase with


    git rebase --abort

OPTIONS
-------
<newbase>::
	Starting point at which to create the new commits. If the
	--onto option is not specified, the starting point is
	<upstream>.

<upstream>::
	Upstream branch to compare against.

<branch>::
	Working branch; defaults to HEAD.

--continue::
	Restart the rebasing process after having resolved a merge conflict.

--abort::
	Restore the original branch and abort the rebase operation.

NOTES
-----
When you rebase a branch, you are changing its history in a way that
will cause problems for anyone who already has a copy of the branch
in their repository and tries to pull updates from you.  You should
understand the implications of using 'git rebase' on a repository that
you share.

When the git rebase command is run, it will first execute a "pre-rebase"
hook if one exists.  You can use this hook to do sanity checks and
reject the rebase if it isn't appropriate.  Please see the template
pre-rebase hook script for an example.

You must be in the top directory of your project to start (or continue)
a rebase.  Upon completion, <branch> will be the current branch.
