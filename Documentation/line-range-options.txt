-L<start>,<end>:<file>::
-L:<funcname>:<file>::

	Trace the evolution of the line range given by '<start>,<end>',
	or by the function name regex '<funcname>', within the '<file>'. You may
	not give any pathspec limiters.  This is currently limited to
	a walk starting from a single revision, i.e., you may only
	give zero or one positive revision arguments, and
	'<start>' and '<end>' (or '<funcname>') must exist in the starting revision.
	You can specify this option more than once. Implies `--patch`.
	Patch output can be suppressed using `--no-patch`, but other diff formats
	(namely `--raw`, `--numstat`, `--shortstat`, `--dirstat`, `--summary`,
	`--name-only`, `--name-status`, `--check`) are not currently implemented.
