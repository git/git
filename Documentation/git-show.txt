NAME
----
git-show - Show various types of objects


SYNOPSIS
--------
'git-show' [options] <object>...

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Shows one or more objects (blobs, trees, tags and commits).

For commits it shows the log message and textual diff. It also
presents the merge commit in a special format as produced by
'git-diff-tree --cc'.

For tags, it shows the tag message and the referenced objects.

For trees, it shows the names (equivalent to gitlink:git-ls-tree[1]
with \--name-only).

For plain blobs, it shows the plain contents.

This manual page describes only the most frequently used options.
