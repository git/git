git-show(1)
===========

NAME
----
git-show - Show various types of objects


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git show' [<options>] [<object>...]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Shows one or more objects (blobs, trees, tags and commits).

For commits it shows the log message and textual diff. It also
presents the merge commit in a special format as produced by
'git diff-tree --cc'.

For tags, it shows the tag message and the referenced objects.

For trees, it shows the names (equivalent to 'git ls-tree'
with --name-only).

For plain blobs, it shows the plain contents.

The command takes options applicable to the 'git diff-tree' command to
control how the changes the commit introduces are shown.

This manual page describes only the most frequently used options.


OPTIONS
-------
<object>...::
	The names of objects to show (defaults to 'HEAD').
	For a more complete list of ways to spell object names, see
	"SPECIFYING REVISIONS" section in linkgit:gitrevisions[7].
