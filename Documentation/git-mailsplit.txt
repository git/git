NAME
----
git-mailsplit - Simple UNIX mbox splitter program

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git mailsplit' [-b] [-f<nn>] [-d<prec>] [--keep-cr] [--mboxrd]
		-o<directory> [--] [(<mbox>|<Maildir>)...]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Splits a mbox file or a Maildir into a list of files: "0001" "0002" ..  in the
specified directory so you can process them further from there.

IMPORTANT: Maildir splitting relies upon filenames being sorted to output
patches in the correct order.

OPTIONS
-------
<mbox>::
	Mbox file to split.  If not given, the mbox is read from
	the standard input.

<Maildir>::
	Root of the Maildir to split. This directory should contain the cur, tmp
	and new subdirectories.

-o<directory>::
	Directory in which to place the individual messages.

-b::
	If any file doesn't begin with a From line, assume it is a
	single mail message instead of signaling error.

-d<prec>::
	Instead of the default 4 digits with leading zeros,
	different precision can be specified for the generated
	filenames.

-f<nn>::
	Skip the first <nn> numbers, for example if -f3 is specified,
	start the numbering with 0004.

--keep-cr::
	Do not remove `\r` from lines ending with `\r\n`.

--mboxrd::
	Input is of the "mboxrd" format and "^>+From " line escaping is
	reversed.
