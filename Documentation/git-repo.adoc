COMMANDS
--------
`info [<key>...]`::
	Retrieve metadata-related information about the current repository. Only
	the requested data will be returned based on their keys (see "INFO KEYS"
	section below).

The values are returned in the same order in which their respective keys were
requested.

The output format consists of key-value pairs one per line using the `=`
character as the delimiter between the key and the value. Values containing
"unusual" characters are quoted as explained for the configuration variable
`core.quotePath` (see linkgit:git-config[1]).

the keys that identify them. Here's a list of the available keys and the
values that they return:

	`true` if this is a bare repository, otherwise `false`.

`layout.shallow`::
	`true` if this is a shallow repository, otherwise `false`.
