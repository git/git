NAME
----
git-svn - Bidirectional operation between a Subversion repository and git

SYNOPSIS
--------
'git svn' <command> [options] [arguments]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
'git svn' is a simple conduit for changesets between Subversion and git.
It provides a bidirectional flow of changes between a Subversion and a git
repository.

'git svn' can track a standard Subversion repository,
following the common "trunk/branches/tags" layout, with the --stdlayout option.
It can also follow branches and tags in any layout with the -T/-t/-b options
(see options to 'init' below, and also the 'clone' command).

Once tracking a Subversion repository (with any of the above methods), the git
repository can be updated from Subversion by the 'fetch' command and
Subversion updated from git by the 'dcommit' command.

COMMANDS
--------

'init'::
	Initializes an empty git repository with additional
	metadata directories for 'git svn'.  The Subversion URL
	may be specified as a command-line argument, or as full
	URL arguments to -T/-t/-b.  Optionally, the target
	directory to operate on can be specified as a second
	argument.  Normally this command initializes the current
	directory.

-T<trunk_subdir>;;
--trunk=<trunk_subdir>;;
-t<tags_subdir>;;
--tags=<tags_subdir>;;
-b<branches_subdir>;;
--branches=<branches_subdir>;;
-s;;
--stdlayout;;
	These are optional command-line options for init.  Each of
	these flags can point to a relative repository path
	(--tags=project/tags) or a full url
	(--tags=https://foo.org/project/tags).
	You can specify more than one --tags and/or --branches options, in case
	your Subversion repository places tags or branches under multiple paths.
	The option --stdlayout is
	a shorthand way of setting trunk,tags,branches as the relative paths,
	which is the Subversion default. If any of the other options are given
	as well, they take precedence.
--no-metadata;;
	Set the 'noMetadata' option in the [svn-remote] config.
--use-svm-props;;
	Set the 'useSvmProps' option in the [svn-remote] config.
--use-svnsync-props;;
	Set the 'useSvnsyncProps' option in the [svn-remote] config.
--rewrite-root=<URL>;;
	Set the 'rewriteRoot' option in the [svn-remote] config.
--rewrite-uuid=<UUID>;;
	Set the 'rewriteUUID' option in the [svn-remote] config.
--username=<USER>;;
	For transports that SVN handles authentication for (http,
	https, and plain svn), specify the username.  For other
	transports (eg svn+ssh://), you must include the username in
	the URL, eg svn+ssh://foo@svn.bar.com/project
--prefix=<prefix>;;
	This allows one to specify a prefix which is prepended
	to the names of remotes if trunk/branches/tags are
	specified.  The prefix does not automatically include a
	trailing slash, so be sure you include one in the
	argument if that is what you want.  If --branches/-b is
	specified, the prefix must include a trailing slash.
	Setting a prefix is useful if you wish to track multiple
	projects that share a common repository.
--ignore-paths=<regex>;;
	When passed to 'init' or 'clone' this regular expression will
	be preserved as a config key.  See 'fetch' for a description
	of '--ignore-paths'.
--no-minimize-url;;
	When tracking multiple directories (using --stdlayout,
	--branches, or --tags options), git svn will attempt to connect
	to the root (or highest allowed level) of the Subversion
	repository.  This default allows better tracking of history if
	entire projects are moved within a repository, but may cause
	issues on repositories where read access restrictions are in
	place.  Passing '--no-minimize-url' will allow git svn to
	accept URLs as-is without attempting to connect to a higher
	level directory.  This option is off by default when only
	one URL/branch is tracked (it would do little good).

'fetch'::
	Fetch unfetched revisions from the Subversion remote we are
	tracking.  The name of the [svn-remote "..."] section in the
	.git/config file may be specified as an optional command-line
	argument.

--localtime;;
	Store Git commit times in the local timezone instead of UTC.  This
	makes 'git log' (even without --date=local) show the same times
	that `svn log` would in the local timezone.
+
This doesn't interfere with interoperating with the Subversion
repository you cloned from, but if you wish for your local Git
repository to be able to interoperate with someone else's local Git
repository, either don't use this option or you should both use it in
the same local timezone.

--parent;;
	Fetch only from the SVN parent of the current HEAD.

--ignore-paths=<regex>;;
	This allows one to specify a Perl regular expression that will
	cause skipping of all matching paths from checkout from SVN.
	The '--ignore-paths' option should match for every 'fetch'
	(including automatic fetches due to 'clone', 'dcommit',
	'rebase', etc) on a given repository.
+
[verse]
config key: svn-remote.<name>.ignore-paths
+
If the ignore-paths config key is set and the command line option is
also given, both regular expressions will be used.
+
Examples:
+
--
Skip "doc*" directory for every fetch;;
+
------------------------------------------------------------------------
--ignore-paths="^doc"
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Skip "branches" and "tags" of first level directories;;
+
------------------------------------------------------------------------
--ignore-paths="^[^/]+/(?:branches|tags)"
------------------------------------------------------------------------
--

--use-log-author;;
	When retrieving svn commits into git (as part of fetch, rebase, or
	dcommit operations), look for the first From: or Signed-off-by: line
	in the log message and use that as the author string.
--add-author-from;;
	When committing to svn from git (as part of commit or dcommit
	operations), if the existing log message doesn't already have a
	From: or Signed-off-by: line, append a From: line based on the
	git commit's author string.  If you use this, then --use-log-author
	will retrieve a valid author string for all commits.

'clone'::
	Runs 'init' and 'fetch'.  It will automatically create a
	directory based on the basename of the URL passed to it;
	or if a second argument is passed; it will create a directory
	and work within that.  It accepts all arguments that the
	'init' and 'fetch' commands accept; with the exception of
	'--fetch-all' and '--parent'.  After a repository is cloned,
	the 'fetch' command will be able to update revisions without
	affecting the working tree; and the 'rebase' command will be
	able to update the working tree with the latest changes.

'rebase'::
	This fetches revisions from the SVN parent of the current HEAD
	and rebases the current (uncommitted to SVN) work against it.
+
This works similarly to `svn update` or 'git pull' except that
it preserves linear history with 'git rebase' instead of
'git merge' for ease of dcommitting with 'git svn'.
+
This accepts all options that 'git svn fetch' and 'git rebase'
accept.  However, '--fetch-all' only fetches from the current
[svn-remote], and not all [svn-remote] definitions.
+
Like 'git rebase'; this requires that the working tree be clean
and have no uncommitted changes.

-l;;
--local;;
	Do not fetch remotely; only run 'git rebase' against the
	last fetched commit from the upstream SVN.

'dcommit'::
	Commit each diff from a specified head directly to the SVN
	repository, and then rebase or reset (depending on whether or
	not there is a diff between SVN and head).  This will create
	a revision in SVN for each commit in git.
	It is recommended that you run 'git svn' fetch and rebase (not
	pull or merge) your commits against the latest changes in the
	SVN repository.
	An optional revision or branch argument may be specified, and
	causes 'git svn' to do all work on that revision/branch
	instead of HEAD.
	This is advantageous over 'set-tree' (below) because it produces
	cleaner, more linear history.
+
--no-rebase;;
	After committing, do not rebase or reset.
--commit-url <URL>;;
	Commit to this SVN URL (the full path).  This is intended to
	allow existing 'git svn' repositories created with one transport
	method (e.g. `svn://` or `http://` for anonymous read) to be
	reused if a user is later given access to an alternate transport
	method (e.g. `svn+ssh://` or `https://`) for commit.
+
[verse]
config key: svn-remote.<name>.commiturl
config key: svn.commiturl (overwrites all svn-remote.<name>.commiturl options)
+
Using this option for any other purpose (don't ask) is very strongly
discouraged.

'branch'::
	Create a branch in the SVN repository.

-m;;
--message;;
	Allows to specify the commit message.

-t;;
--tag;;
	Create a tag by using the tags_subdir instead of the branches_subdir
	specified during git svn init.

-d;;
--destination;;
	If more than one --branches (or --tags) option was given to the 'init'
	or 'clone' command, you must provide the location of the branch (or
	tag) you wish to create in the SVN repository.  The value of this
	option must match one of the paths specified by a --branches (or
	--tags) option.  You can see these paths with the commands
+
	git config --get-all svn-remote.<name>.branches
	git config --get-all svn-remote.<name>.tags
+
where <name> is the name of the SVN repository as specified by the -R option to
'init' (or "svn" by default).

--username;;
	Specify the SVN username to perform the commit as.  This option overrides
	the 'username' configuration property.

--commit-url;;
	Use the specified URL to connect to the destination Subversion
	repository.  This is useful in cases where the source SVN
	repository is read-only.  This option overrides configuration
	property 'commiturl'.
+
	git config --get-all svn-remote.<name>.commiturl
+

'tag'::
	Create a tag in the SVN repository. This is a shorthand for
	'branch -t'.

'log'::
	This should make it easy to look up svn log messages when svn
	users refer to -r/--revision numbers.
+
The following features from `svn log' are supported:
+
--
-r <n>[:<n>];;
--revision=<n>[:<n>];;
	is supported, non-numeric args are not:
	HEAD, NEXT, BASE, PREV, etc ...
-v;;
--verbose;;
	it's not completely compatible with the --verbose
	output in svn log, but reasonably close.
--limit=<n>;;
	is NOT the same as --max-count, doesn't count
	merged/excluded commits
--incremental;;
	supported
--
+
New features:
+
--
--show-commit;;
	shows the git commit sha1, as well
--oneline;;
	our version of --pretty=oneline
--
+
NOTE: SVN itself only stores times in UTC and nothing else. The regular svn
client converts the UTC time to the local time (or based on the TZ=
environment). This command has the same behaviour.
+
Any other arguments are passed directly to 'git log'

'blame'::
       Show what revision and author last modified each line of a file. The
       output of this mode is format-compatible with the output of
       `svn blame' by default. Like the SVN blame command,
       local uncommitted changes in the working copy are ignored;
       the version of the file in the HEAD revision is annotated. Unknown
       arguments are passed directly to 'git blame'.
+
--git-format;;
	Produce output in the same format as 'git blame', but with
	SVN revision numbers instead of git commit hashes. In this mode,
	changes that haven't been committed to SVN (including local
	working-copy edits) are shown as revision 0.

'find-rev'::
	When given an SVN revision number of the form 'rN', returns the
	corresponding git commit hash (this can optionally be followed by a
	tree-ish to specify which branch should be searched).  When given a
	tree-ish, returns the corresponding SVN revision number.

'set-tree'::
	You should consider using 'dcommit' instead of this command.
	Commit specified commit or tree objects to SVN.  This relies on
	your imported fetch data being up-to-date.  This makes
	absolutely no attempts to do patching when committing to SVN, it
	simply overwrites files with those specified in the tree or
	commit.  All merging is assumed to have taken place
	independently of 'git svn' functions.

'create-ignore'::
	Recursively finds the svn:ignore property on directories and
	creates matching .gitignore files. The resulting files are staged to
	be committed, but are not committed. Use -r/--revision to refer to a
	specific revision.

'show-ignore'::
	Recursively finds and lists the svn:ignore property on
	directories.  The output is suitable for appending to
	the $GIT_DIR/info/exclude file.

'mkdirs'::
	Attempts to recreate empty directories that core git cannot track
	based on information in $GIT_DIR/svn/<refname>/unhandled.log files.
	Empty directories are automatically recreated when using
	"git svn clone" and "git svn rebase", so "mkdirs" is intended
	for use after commands like "git checkout" or "git reset".

'commit-diff'::
	Commits the diff of two tree-ish arguments from the
	command-line.  This command does not rely on being inside an `git svn
	init`-ed repository.  This command takes three arguments, (a) the
	original tree to diff against, (b) the new tree result, (c) the
	URL of the target Subversion repository.  The final argument
	(URL) may be omitted if you are working from a 'git svn'-aware
	repository (that has been `init`-ed with 'git svn').
	The -r<revision> option is required for this.

'info'::
	Shows information about a file or directory similar to what
	`svn info' provides.  Does not currently support a -r/--revision
	argument.  Use the --url option to output only the value of the
	'URL:' field.

'proplist'::
	Lists the properties stored in the Subversion repository about a
	given file or directory.  Use -r/--revision to refer to a specific
	Subversion revision.

'propget'::
	Gets the Subversion property given as the first argument, for a
	file.  A specific revision can be specified with -r/--revision.

'show-externals'::
	Shows the Subversion externals.  Use -r/--revision to specify a
	specific revision.

'gc'::
	Compress $GIT_DIR/svn/<refname>/unhandled.log files in .git/svn
	and remove $GIT_DIR/svn/<refname>index files in .git/svn.

'reset'::
	Undoes the effects of 'fetch' back to the specified revision.
	This allows you to re-'fetch' an SVN revision.  Normally the
	contents of an SVN revision should never change and 'reset'
	should not be necessary.  However, if SVN permissions change,
	or if you alter your --ignore-paths option, a 'fetch' may fail
	with "not found in commit" (file not previously visible) or
	"checksum mismatch" (missed a modification).  If the problem
	file cannot be ignored forever (with --ignore-paths) the only
	way to repair the repo is to use 'reset'.
+
Only the rev_map and refs/remotes/git-svn are changed.  Follow 'reset'
with a 'fetch' and then 'git reset' or 'git rebase' to move local
branches onto the new tree.

-r <n>;;
--revision=<n>;;
	Specify the most recent revision to keep.  All later revisions
	are discarded.
-p;;
--parent;;
	Discard the specified revision as well, keeping the nearest
	parent instead.
Example:;;
Assume you have local changes in "master", but you need to refetch "r2".
+
------------
    r1---r2---r3 remotes/git-svn
                \
                 A---B master
------------
+
Fix the ignore-paths or SVN permissions problem that caused "r2" to
be incomplete in the first place.  Then:
+
[verse]
git svn reset -r2 -p
git svn fetch
+
------------
    r1---r2'--r3' remotes/git-svn
      \
       r2---r3---A---B master
------------
+
Then fixup "master" with 'git rebase'.
Do NOT use 'git merge' or your history will not be compatible with a
future 'dcommit'!
+
[verse]
git rebase --onto remotes/git-svn A^ master
+
------------
    r1---r2'--r3' remotes/git-svn
                \
                 A'--B' master
------------

OPTIONS
-------

--shared[={false|true|umask|group|all|world|everybody}]::
--template=<template_directory>::
	Only used with the 'init' command.
	These are passed directly to 'git init'.

-r <ARG>::
--revision <ARG>::
	   Used with the 'fetch' command.
+
This allows revision ranges for partial/cauterized history
to be supported.  $NUMBER, $NUMBER1:$NUMBER2 (numeric ranges),
$NUMBER:HEAD, and BASE:$NUMBER are all supported.
+
This can allow you to make partial mirrors when running fetch;
but is generally not recommended because history will be skipped
and lost.

-::
--stdin::
	Only used with the 'set-tree' command.
+
Read a list of commits from stdin and commit them in reverse
order.  Only the leading sha1 is read from each line, so
'git rev-list --pretty=oneline' output can be used.

--rmdir::
	Only used with the 'dcommit', 'set-tree' and 'commit-diff' commands.
+
Remove directories from the SVN tree if there are no files left
behind.  SVN can version empty directories, and they are not
removed by default if there are no files left in them.  git
cannot version empty directories.  Enabling this flag will make
the commit to SVN act like git.
+
[verse]
config key: svn.rmdir

-e::
--edit::
	Only used with the 'dcommit', 'set-tree' and 'commit-diff' commands.
+
Edit the commit message before committing to SVN.  This is off by
default for objects that are commits, and forced on when committing
tree objects.
+
[verse]
config key: svn.edit

-l<num>::
--find-copies-harder::
	Only used with the 'dcommit', 'set-tree' and 'commit-diff' commands.
+
They are both passed directly to 'git diff-tree'; see
linkgit:git-diff-tree[1] for more information.
+
[verse]
config key: svn.l
config key: svn.findcopiesharder

-A<filename>::
--authors-file=<filename>::
	Syntax is compatible with the file used by 'git cvsimport':
+
------------------------------------------------------------------------
	loginname = Joe User <user@example.com>
------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
If this option is specified and 'git svn' encounters an SVN
committer name that does not exist in the authors-file, 'git svn'
will abort operation. The user will then have to add the
appropriate entry.  Re-running the previous 'git svn' command
after the authors-file is modified should continue operation.
+
[verse]
config key: svn.authorsfile

--authors-prog=<filename>::
	If this option is specified, for each SVN committer name that
	does not exist in the authors file, the given file is executed
	with the committer name as the first argument.  The program is
	expected to return a single line of the form "Name <email>",
	which will be treated as if included in the authors file.

-q::
--quiet::
	Make 'git svn' less verbose. Specify a second time to make it
	even less verbose.

--repack[=<n>]::
--repack-flags=<flags>::
	These should help keep disk usage sane for large fetches with
	many revisions.
+
--repack takes an optional argument for the number of revisions
to fetch before repacking.  This defaults to repacking every
1000 commits fetched if no argument is specified.
+
--repack-flags are passed directly to 'git repack'.
+
[verse]
config key: svn.repack
config key: svn.repackflags

-m::
--merge::
-s<strategy>::
--strategy=<strategy>::
	These are only used with the 'dcommit' and 'rebase' commands.
+
Passed directly to 'git rebase' when using 'dcommit' if a
'git reset' cannot be used (see 'dcommit').

-n::
--dry-run::
	This can be used with the 'dcommit', 'rebase', 'branch' and
	'tag' commands.
+
For 'dcommit', print out the series of git arguments that would show
which diffs would be committed to SVN.
+
For 'rebase', display the local branch associated with the upstream svn
repository associated with the current branch and the URL of svn
repository that will be fetched from.
+
For 'branch' and 'tag', display the urls that will be used for copying when
creating the branch or tag.


ADVANCED OPTIONS
----------------

-i<GIT_SVN_ID>::
--id <GIT_SVN_ID>::
	This sets GIT_SVN_ID (instead of using the environment).  This
	allows the user to override the default refname to fetch from
	when tracking a single URL.  The 'log' and 'dcommit' commands
	no longer require this switch as an argument.

-R<remote name>::
--svn-remote <remote name>::
	Specify the [svn-remote "<remote name>"] section to use,
	this allows SVN multiple repositories to be tracked.
	Default: "svn"

--follow-parent::
	This is especially helpful when we're tracking a directory
	that has been moved around within the repository, or if we
	started tracking a branch and never tracked the trunk it was
	descended from. This feature is enabled by default, use
	--no-follow-parent to disable it.
+
[verse]
config key: svn.followparent

CONFIG FILE-ONLY OPTIONS
------------------------

svn.noMetadata::
svn-remote.<name>.noMetadata::
	This gets rid of the 'git-svn-id:' lines at the end of every commit.
+
If you lose your .git/svn/git-svn/.rev_db file, 'git svn' will not
be able to rebuild it and you won't be able to fetch again,
either.  This is fine for one-shot imports.
+
The 'git svn log' command will not work on repositories using
this, either.  Using this conflicts with the 'useSvmProps'
option for (hopefully) obvious reasons.

svn.useSvmProps::
svn-remote.<name>.useSvmProps::
	This allows 'git svn' to re-map repository URLs and UUIDs from
	mirrors created using SVN::Mirror (or svk) for metadata.
+
If an SVN revision has a property, "svm:headrev", it is likely
that the revision was created by SVN::Mirror (also used by SVK).
The property contains a repository UUID and a revision.  We want
to make it look like we are mirroring the original URL, so
introduce a helper function that returns the original identity
URL and UUID, and use it when generating metadata in commit
messages.

svn.useSvnsyncProps::
svn-remote.<name>.useSvnsyncprops::
	Similar to the useSvmProps option; this is for users
	of the svnsync(1) command distributed with SVN 1.4.x and
	later.

svn-remote.<name>.rewriteRoot::
	This allows users to create repositories from alternate
	URLs.  For example, an administrator could run 'git svn' on the
	server locally (accessing via file://) but wish to distribute
	the repository with a public http:// or svn:// URL in the
	metadata so users of it will see the public URL.

svn-remote.<name>.rewriteUUID::
	Similar to the useSvmProps option; this is for users who need
	to remap the UUID manually. This may be useful in situations
	where the original UUID is not available via either useSvmProps
	or useSvnsyncProps.

svn.brokenSymlinkWorkaround::
	This disables potentially expensive checks to workaround
	broken symlinks checked into SVN by broken clients.  Set this
	option to "false" if you track a SVN repository with many
	empty blobs that are not symlinks.  This option may be changed
	while 'git svn' is running and take effect on the next
	revision fetched.  If unset, 'git svn' assumes this option to
	be "true".

svn.pathnameencoding::
	This instructs git svn to recode pathnames to a given encoding.
	It can be used by windows users and by those who work in non-utf8
	locales to avoid corrupted file names with non-ASCII characters.
	Valid encodings are the ones supported by Perl's Encode module.

Since the noMetadata, rewriteRoot, rewriteUUID, useSvnsyncProps and useSvmProps
options all affect the metadata generated and used by 'git svn'; they
*must* be set in the configuration file before any history is imported
and these settings should never be changed once they are set.

Additionally, only one of these options can be used per svn-remote
section because they affect the 'git-svn-id:' metadata line, except
for rewriteRoot and rewriteUUID which can be used together.


BASIC EXAMPLES
--------------

Tracking and contributing to the trunk of a Subversion-managed project:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Clone a repo (like git clone):
	git svn clone http://svn.example.com/project/trunk
# Enter the newly cloned directory:
	cd trunk
# You should be on master branch, double-check with 'git branch'
	git branch
# Do some work and commit locally to git:
	git commit ...
# Something is committed to SVN, rebase your local changes against the
# latest changes in SVN:
	git svn rebase
# Now commit your changes (that were committed previously using git) to SVN,
# as well as automatically updating your working HEAD:
	git svn dcommit
# Append svn:ignore settings to the default git exclude file:
	git svn show-ignore >> .git/info/exclude
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tracking and contributing to an entire Subversion-managed project
(complete with a trunk, tags and branches):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Clone a repo (like git clone):
	git svn clone http://svn.example.com/project -T trunk -b branches -t tags
# View all branches and tags you have cloned:
	git branch -r
# Create a new branch in SVN
    git svn branch waldo
# Reset your master to trunk (or any other branch, replacing 'trunk'
# with the appropriate name):
	git reset --hard remotes/trunk
# You may only dcommit to one branch/tag/trunk at a time.  The usage
# of dcommit/rebase/show-ignore should be the same as above.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The initial 'git svn clone' can be quite time-consuming
(especially for large Subversion repositories). If multiple
people (or one person with multiple machines) want to use
'git svn' to interact with the same Subversion repository, you can
do the initial 'git svn clone' to a repository on a server and
have each person clone that repository with 'git clone':

------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Do the initial import on a server
	ssh server "cd /pub && git svn clone http://svn.example.com/project
# Clone locally - make sure the refs/remotes/ space matches the server
	mkdir project
	cd project
	git init
	git remote add origin server:/pub/project
	git config --add remote.origin.fetch '+refs/remotes/*:refs/remotes/*'
	git fetch
# Create a local branch from one of the branches just fetched
	git checkout -b master FETCH_HEAD
# Initialize 'git svn' locally (be sure to use the same URL and -T/-b/-t options as were used on server)
	git svn init http://svn.example.com/project
# Pull the latest changes from Subversion
	git svn rebase
------------------------------------------------------------------------

REBASE VS. PULL/MERGE
---------------------

Originally, 'git svn' recommended that the 'remotes/git-svn' branch be
pulled or merged from.  This is because the author favored
`git svn set-tree B` to commit a single head rather than the
`git svn set-tree A..B` notation to commit multiple commits.

If you use `git svn set-tree A..B` to commit several diffs and you do
not have the latest remotes/git-svn merged into my-branch, you should
use `git svn rebase` to update your work branch instead of `git pull` or
`git merge`.  `pull`/`merge` can cause non-linear history to be flattened
when committing into SVN, which can lead to merge commits reversing
previous commits in SVN.

DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
-----------------
Merge tracking in Subversion is lacking and doing branched development
with Subversion can be cumbersome as a result.  While 'git svn' can track
copy history (including branches and tags) for repositories adopting a
standard layout, it cannot yet represent merge history that happened
inside git back upstream to SVN users.  Therefore it is advised that
users keep history as linear as possible inside git to ease
compatibility with SVN (see the CAVEATS section below).

CAVEATS
-------

For the sake of simplicity and interoperating with a less-capable system
(SVN), it is recommended that all 'git svn' users clone, fetch and dcommit
directly from the SVN server, and avoid all 'git clone'/'pull'/'merge'/'push'
operations between git repositories and branches.  The recommended
method of exchanging code between git branches and users is
'git format-patch' and 'git am', or just 'dcommit'ing to the SVN repository.

Running 'git merge' or 'git pull' is NOT recommended on a branch you
plan to 'dcommit' from.  Subversion does not represent merges in any
reasonable or useful fashion; so users using Subversion cannot see any
merges you've made.  Furthermore, if you merge or pull from a git branch
that is a mirror of an SVN branch, 'dcommit' may commit to the wrong
branch.

If you do merge, note the following rule: 'git svn dcommit' will
attempt to commit on top of the SVN commit named in
------------------------------------------------------------------------
git log --grep=^git-svn-id: --first-parent -1
------------------------------------------------------------------------
You 'must' therefore ensure that the most recent commit of the branch
you want to dcommit to is the 'first' parent of the merge.  Chaos will
ensue otherwise, especially if the first parent is an older commit on
the same SVN branch.

'git clone' does not clone branches under the refs/remotes/ hierarchy or
any 'git svn' metadata, or config.  So repositories created and managed with
using 'git svn' should use 'rsync' for cloning, if cloning is to be done
at all.

Since 'dcommit' uses rebase internally, any git branches you 'git push' to
before 'dcommit' on will require forcing an overwrite of the existing ref
on the remote repository.  This is generally considered bad practice,
see the linkgit:git-push[1] documentation for details.

Do not use the --amend option of linkgit:git-commit[1] on a change you've
already dcommitted.  It is considered bad practice to --amend commits
you've already pushed to a remote repository for other users, and
dcommit with SVN is analogous to that.

When using multiple --branches or --tags, 'git svn' does not automatically
handle name collisions (for example, if two branches from different paths have
the same name, or if a branch and a tag have the same name).  In these cases,
use 'init' to set up your git repository then, before your first 'fetch', edit
the .git/config file so that the branches and tags are associated with
different name spaces.  For example:

	branches = stable/*:refs/remotes/svn/stable/*
	branches = debug/*:refs/remotes/svn/debug/*

BUGS
----

We ignore all SVN properties except svn:executable.  Any unhandled
properties are logged to $GIT_DIR/svn/<refname>/unhandled.log

Renamed and copied directories are not detected by git and hence not
tracked when committing to SVN.  I do not plan on adding support for
this as it's quite difficult and time-consuming to get working for all
the possible corner cases (git doesn't do it, either).  Committing
renamed and copied files are fully supported if they're similar enough
for git to detect them.

CONFIGURATION
-------------

'git svn' stores [svn-remote] configuration information in the
repository .git/config file.  It is similar the core git
[remote] sections except 'fetch' keys do not accept glob
arguments; but they are instead handled by the 'branches'
and 'tags' keys.  Since some SVN repositories are oddly
configured with multiple projects glob expansions such those
listed below are allowed:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
[svn-remote "project-a"]
	url = http://server.org/svn
	fetch = trunk/project-a:refs/remotes/project-a/trunk
	branches = branches/*/project-a:refs/remotes/project-a/branches/*
	tags = tags/*/project-a:refs/remotes/project-a/tags/*
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Keep in mind that the '\*' (asterisk) wildcard of the local ref
(right of the ':') *must* be the farthest right path component;
however the remote wildcard may be anywhere as long as it's an
independent path component (surrounded by '/' or EOL).   This
type of configuration is not automatically created by 'init' and
should be manually entered with a text-editor or using 'git config'.

It is also possible to fetch a subset of branches or tags by using a
comma-separated list of names within braces. For example:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
[svn-remote "huge-project"]
	url = http://server.org/svn
	fetch = trunk/src:refs/remotes/trunk
	branches = branches/{red,green}/src:refs/remotes/branches/*
	tags = tags/{1.0,2.0}/src:refs/remotes/tags/*
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that git-svn keeps track of the highest revision in which a branch
or tag has appeared. If the subset of branches or tags is changed after
fetching, then .git/svn/.metadata must be manually edited to remove (or
reset) branches-maxRev and/or tags-maxRev as appropriate.
