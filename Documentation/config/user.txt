user.name::
user.email::
author.name::
author.email::
committer.name::
committer.email::
	The `user.name` and `user.email` variables determine what ends
	up in the `author` and `committer` field of commit
	objects.
	If you need the `author` or `committer` to be different, the
	`author.name`, `author.email`, `committer.name` or
	`committer.email` variables can be set.
	Also, all of these can be overridden by the `GIT_AUTHOR_NAME`,
	`GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL`, `GIT_COMMITTER_NAME`,
	`GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL` and `EMAIL` environment variables.
+
Note that the `name` forms of these variables conventionally refer to
some form of a personal name.  See linkgit:git-commit[1] and the
environment variables section of linkgit:git[1] for more information on
these settings and the `credential.username` option if you're looking
for authentication credentials instead.

user.useConfigOnly::
	Instruct Git to avoid trying to guess defaults for `user.email`
	and `user.name`, and instead retrieve the values only from the
	configuration. For example, if you have multiple email addresses
	and would like to use a different one for each repository, then
	with this configuration option set to `true` in the global config
	along with a name, Git will prompt you to set up an email before
	making new commits in a newly cloned repository.
	Defaults to `false`.

user.signingKey::
	If linkgit:git-tag[1] or linkgit:git-commit[1] is not selecting the
	key you want it to automatically when creating a signed tag or
	commit, you can override the default selection with this variable.
	This option is passed unchanged to gpg's --local-user parameter,
	so you may specify a key using any method that gpg supports.
	If gpg.format is set to "ssh" this can contain the literal ssh public
	key (e.g.: "ssh-rsa XXXXXX identifier") or a file which contains it and
	corresponds to the private key used for signing. The private key
	needs to be available via ssh-agent. Alternatively it can be set to
	a file containing a private key directly. If not set git will call
	gpg.ssh.defaultKeyCommand (e.g.: "ssh-add -L") and try to use the first
	key available.
