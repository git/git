credential.helper::
	Specify an external helper to be called when a username or
	password credential is needed; the helper may consult external
	storage to avoid prompting the user for the credentials. This is
	normally the name of a credential helper with possible
	arguments, but may also be an absolute path with arguments or, if
	preceded by `!`, shell commands.
+
Note that multiple helpers may be defined. See linkgit:gitcredentials[7]
for details and examples.

credential.interactive::
	By default, Git and any configured credential helpers will ask for
	user input when new credentials are required. Many of these helpers
	will succeed based on stored credentials if those credentials are
	still valid. To avoid the possibility of user interactivity from
	Git, set `credential.interactive=false`. Some credential helpers
	respect this option as well.

credential.useHttpPath::
	When acquiring credentials, consider the "path" component of an http
	or https URL to be important. Defaults to false. See
	linkgit:gitcredentials[7] for more information.

credential.sanitizePrompt::
	By default, user names and hosts that are shown as part of the
	password prompt are not allowed to contain control characters (they
	will be URL-encoded by default). Configure this setting to `false` to
	override that behavior.

credential.protectProtocol::
	By default, Carriage Return characters are not allowed in the protocol
	that is used when Git talks to a credential helper. This setting allows
	users to override this default.

credential.username::
	If no username is set for a network authentication, use this username
	by default. See credential.<context>.* below, and
	linkgit:gitcredentials[7].

credential.<url>.*::
	Any of the credential.* options above can be applied selectively to
	some credentials. For example, "credential.https://example.com.username"
	would set the default username only for https connections to
	example.com. See linkgit:gitcredentials[7] for details on how URLs are
	matched.

credentialCache.ignoreSIGHUP::
	Tell git-credential-cache--daemon to ignore SIGHUP, instead of quitting.

credentialStore.lockTimeoutMS::
	The length of time, in milliseconds, for git-credential-store to retry
	when trying to lock the credentials file. A value of 0 means not to retry at
	all; -1 means to try indefinitely. Default is 1000 (i.e., retry for
	1s).
