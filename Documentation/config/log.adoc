log.abbrevCommit::
	If true, makes linkgit:git-log[1], linkgit:git-show[1], and
	linkgit:git-whatchanged[1] assume `--abbrev-commit`. You may
	override this option with `--no-abbrev-commit`.

log.date::
	Set the default date-time mode for the 'log' command.
	Setting a value for log.date is similar to using 'git log''s
	`--date` option.  See linkgit:git-log[1] for details.
+
If the format is set to "auto:foo" and the pager is in use, format
"foo" will be used for the date format. Otherwise, "default" will
be used.

log.decorate::
	Print out the ref names of any commits that are shown by the log
	command. If 'short' is specified, the ref name prefixes 'refs/heads/',
	'refs/tags/' and 'refs/remotes/' will not be printed. If 'full' is
	specified, the full ref name (including prefix) will be printed.
	If 'auto' is specified, then if the output is going to a terminal,
	the ref names are shown as if 'short' were given, otherwise no ref
	names are shown. This is the same as the `--decorate` option
	of the `git log`.

log.initialDecorationSet::
	By default, `git log` only shows decorations for certain known ref
	namespaces. If 'all' is specified, then show all refs as
	decorations.

log.excludeDecoration::
	Exclude the specified patterns from the log decorations. This is
	similar to the `--decorate-refs-exclude` command-line option, but
	the config option can be overridden by the `--decorate-refs`
	option.

log.diffMerges::
	Set diff format to be used when `--diff-merges=on` is
	specified, see `--diff-merges` in linkgit:git-log[1] for
	details. Defaults to `separate`.

log.follow::
	If `true`, `git log` will act as if the `--follow` option was used when
	a single <path> is given.  This has the same limitations as `--follow`,
	i.e. it cannot be used to follow multiple files and does not work well
	on non-linear history.

log.graphColors::
	A list of colors, separated by commas, that can be used to draw
	history lines in `git log --graph`.

log.showRoot::
	If true, the initial commit will be shown as a big creation event.
	This is equivalent to a diff against an empty tree.
	Tools like linkgit:git-log[1] or linkgit:git-whatchanged[1], which
	normally hide the root commit will now show it. True by default.

log.showSignature::
	If true, makes linkgit:git-log[1], linkgit:git-show[1], and
	linkgit:git-whatchanged[1] assume `--show-signature`.

log.mailmap::
	If true, makes linkgit:git-log[1], linkgit:git-show[1], and
	linkgit:git-whatchanged[1] assume `--use-mailmap`, otherwise
	assume `--no-use-mailmap`. True by default.
