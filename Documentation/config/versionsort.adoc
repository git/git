versionsort.prereleaseSuffix (deprecated)::
	Deprecated alias for `versionsort.suffix`.  Ignored if
	`versionsort.suffix` is set.

versionsort.suffix::
	Even when version sort is used in linkgit:git-tag[1], tagnames
	with the same base version but different suffixes are still sorted
	lexicographically, resulting e.g. in prerelease tags appearing
	after the main release (e.g. "1.0-rc1" after "1.0").  This
	variable can be specified to determine the sorting order of tags
	with different suffixes.
+
By specifying a single suffix in this variable, any tagname containing
that suffix will appear before the corresponding main release.  E.g. if
the variable is set to "-rc", then all "1.0-rcX" tags will appear before
"1.0".  If specified multiple times, once per suffix, then the order of
suffixes in the configuration will determine the sorting order of tagnames
with those suffixes.  E.g. if "-pre" appears before "-rc" in the
configuration, then all "1.0-preX" tags will be listed before any
"1.0-rcX" tags.  The placement of the main release tag relative to tags
with various suffixes can be determined by specifying the empty suffix
among those other suffixes.  E.g. if the suffixes "-rc", "", "-ck", and
"-bfs" appear in the configuration in this order, then all "v4.8-rcX" tags
are listed first, followed by "v4.8", then "v4.8-ckX" and finally
"v4.8-bfsX".
+
If more than one suffix matches the same tagname, then that tagname will
be sorted according to the suffix which starts at the earliest position in
the tagname.  If more than one different matching suffix starts at
that earliest position, then that tagname will be sorted according to the
longest of those suffixes.
The sorting order between different suffixes is undefined if they are
in multiple config files.
