tag.forceSignAnnotated::
	A boolean to specify whether annotated tags created should be GPG signed.
	If `--annotate` is specified on the command line, it takes
	precedence over this option.

tag.sort::
	This variable controls the sort ordering of tags when displayed by
	linkgit:git-tag[1]. Without the "--sort=<value>" option provided, the
	value of this variable will be used as the default.

tag.gpgSign::
	A boolean to specify whether all tags should be GPG signed.
	Use of this option when running in an automated script can
	result in a large number of tags being signed. It is therefore
	convenient to use an agent to avoid typing your gpg passphrase
	several times. Note that this option doesn't affect tag signing
	behavior enabled by "-u <keyid>" or "--local-user=<keyid>" options.

tar.umask::
	This variable can be used to restrict the permission bits of
	tar archive entries.  The default is 0002, which turns off the
	world write bit.  The special value "user" indicates that the
	archiving user's umask will be used instead.  See umask(2) and
	linkgit:git-archive[1].
