fetch.recurseSubmodules::
	This option controls whether `git fetch` (and the underlying fetch
	in `git pull`) will recursively fetch into populated submodules.
	This option can be set either to a boolean value or to 'on-demand'.
	Setting it to a boolean changes the behavior of fetch and pull to
	recurse unconditionally into submodules when set to true or to not
	recurse at all when set to false. When set to 'on-demand', fetch and
	pull will only recurse into a populated submodule when its
	superproject retrieves a commit that updates the submodule's
	reference.
	Defaults to 'on-demand', or to the value of 'submodule.recurse' if set.

fetch.fsckObjects::
	If it is set to true, git-fetch-pack will check all fetched
	objects. See `transfer.fsckObjects` for what's
	checked. Defaults to false. If not set, the value of
	`transfer.fsckObjects` is used instead.

fetch.fsck.<msg-id>::
	Acts like `fsck.<msg-id>`, but is used by
	linkgit:git-fetch-pack[1] instead of linkgit:git-fsck[1]. See
	the `fsck.<msg-id>` documentation for details.

fetch.fsck.skipList::
	Acts like `fsck.skipList`, but is used by
	linkgit:git-fetch-pack[1] instead of linkgit:git-fsck[1]. See
	the `fsck.skipList` documentation for details.

fetch.unpackLimit::
	If the number of objects fetched over the Git native
	transfer is below this
	limit, then the objects will be unpacked into loose object
	files. However if the number of received objects equals or
	exceeds this limit then the received pack will be stored as
	a pack, after adding any missing delta bases.  Storing the
	pack from a push can make the push operation complete faster,
	especially on slow filesystems.  If not set, the value of
	`transfer.unpackLimit` is used instead.

fetch.prune::
	If true, fetch will automatically behave as if the `--prune`
	option was given on the command line.  See also `remote.<name>.prune`
	and the PRUNING section of linkgit:git-fetch[1].

fetch.pruneTags::
	If true, fetch will automatically behave as if the
	`refs/tags/*:refs/tags/*` refspec was provided when pruning,
	if not set already. This allows for setting both this option
	and `fetch.prune` to maintain a 1=1 mapping to upstream
	refs. See also `remote.<name>.pruneTags` and the PRUNING
	section of linkgit:git-fetch[1].

fetch.output::
	Control how ref update status is printed. Valid values are
	`full` and `compact`. Default value is `full`. See section
	OUTPUT in linkgit:git-fetch[1] for detail.

fetch.negotiationAlgorithm::
	Control how information about the commits in the local repository is
	sent when negotiating the contents of the packfile to be sent by the
	server. Set to "skipping" to use an algorithm that skips commits in an
	effort to converge faster, but may result in a larger-than-necessary
	packfile; or set to "noop" to not send any information at all, which
	will almost certainly result in a larger-than-necessary packfile, but
	will skip the negotiation step.
	The default is "default" which instructs Git to use the default algorithm
	that never skips commits (unless the server has acknowledged it or one
	of its descendants). If `feature.experimental` is enabled, then this
	setting defaults to "skipping".
	Unknown values will cause 'git fetch' to error out.
+
See also the `--negotiate-only` and `--negotiation-tip` options to
linkgit:git-fetch[1].

fetch.showForcedUpdates::
	Set to false to enable `--no-show-forced-updates` in
	linkgit:git-fetch[1] and linkgit:git-pull[1] commands.
	Defaults to true.

fetch.parallel::
	Specifies the maximal number of fetch operations to be run in parallel
	at a time (submodules, or remotes when the `--multiple` option of
	linkgit:git-fetch[1] is in effect).
+
A value of 0 will give some reasonable default. If unset, it defaults to 1.
+
For submodules, this setting can be overridden using the `submodule.fetchJobs`
config setting.

fetch.writeCommitGraph::
	Set to true to write a commit-graph after every `git fetch` command
	that downloads a pack-file from a remote. Using the `--split` option,
	most executions will create a very small commit-graph file on top of
	the existing commit-graph file(s). Occasionally, these files will
	merge and the write may take longer. Having an updated commit-graph
	file helps performance of many Git commands, including `git merge-base`,
	`git push -f`, and `git log --graph`. Defaults to false.
