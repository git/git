uploadpack.hideRefs::
	This variable is the same as `transfer.hideRefs`, but applies
	only to `upload-pack` (and so affects only fetches, not pushes).
	An attempt to fetch a hidden ref by `git fetch` will fail.  See
	also `uploadpack.allowTipSHA1InWant`.

uploadpack.allowTipSHA1InWant::
	When `uploadpack.hideRefs` is in effect, allow `upload-pack`
	to accept a fetch request that asks for an object at the tip
	of a hidden ref (by default, such a request is rejected).
	See also `uploadpack.hideRefs`.  Even if this is false, a client
	may be able to steal objects via the techniques described in the
	"SECURITY" section of the linkgit:gitnamespaces[7] man page; it's
	best to keep private data in a separate repository.

uploadpack.allowReachableSHA1InWant::
	Allow `upload-pack` to accept a fetch request that asks for an
	object that is reachable from any ref tip. However, note that
	calculating object reachability is computationally expensive.
	Defaults to `false`.  Even if this is false, a client may be able
	to steal objects via the techniques described in the "SECURITY"
	section of the linkgit:gitnamespaces[7] man page; it's best to
	keep private data in a separate repository.

uploadpack.allowAnySHA1InWant::
	Allow `upload-pack` to accept a fetch request that asks for any
	object at all.
	It implies `uploadpack.allowTipSHA1InWant` and
	`uploadpack.allowReachableSHA1InWant`. If set to `true` it will
	enable both of them, it set to `false` it will disable both of
	them.
	By default not set.

uploadpack.keepAlive::
	When `upload-pack` has started `pack-objects`, there may be a
	quiet period while `pack-objects` prepares the pack. Normally
	it would output progress information, but if `--quiet` was used
	for the fetch, `pack-objects` will output nothing at all until
	the pack data begins. Some clients and networks may consider
	the server to be hung and give up. Setting this option instructs
	`upload-pack` to send an empty keepalive packet every
	`uploadpack.keepAlive` seconds. Setting this option to 0
	disables keepalive packets entirely. The default is 5 seconds.

uploadpack.packObjectsHook::
	If this option is set, when `upload-pack` would run
	`git pack-objects` to create a packfile for a client, it will
	run this shell command instead.  The `pack-objects` command and
	arguments it _would_ have run (including the `git pack-objects`
	at the beginning) are appended to the shell command. The stdin
	and stdout of the hook are treated as if `pack-objects` itself
	was run. I.e., `upload-pack` will feed input intended for
	`pack-objects` to the hook, and expects a completed packfile on
	stdout.

Note that this configuration variable is only respected when it is specified
in protected configuration (see <<SCOPES>>). This is a safety measure
against fetching from untrusted repositories.

uploadpack.allowFilter::
	If this option is set, `upload-pack` will support partial
	clone and partial fetch object filtering.

uploadpackfilter.allow::
	Provides a default value for unspecified object filters (see: the
	below configuration variable). If set to `true`, this will also
	enable all filters which get added in the future.
	Defaults to `true`.

uploadpackfilter.<filter>.allow::
	Explicitly allow or ban the object filter corresponding to
	`<filter>`, where `<filter>` may be one of: `blob:none`,
	`blob:limit`, `object:type`, `tree`, `sparse:oid`, or `combine`.
	If using combined filters, both `combine` and all of the nested
	filter kinds must be allowed. Defaults to `uploadpackfilter.allow`.

uploadpackfilter.tree.maxDepth::
	Only allow `--filter=tree:<n>` when `<n>` is no more than the value of
	`uploadpackfilter.tree.maxDepth`. If set, this also implies
	`uploadpackfilter.tree.allow=true`, unless this configuration
	variable had already been set. Has no effect if unset.

uploadpack.allowRefInWant::
	If this option is set, `upload-pack` will support the `ref-in-want`
	feature of the protocol version 2 `fetch` command.  This feature
	is intended for the benefit of load-balanced servers which may
	not have the same view of what OIDs their refs point to due to
	replication delay.
