format.attach::
	Enable multipart/mixed attachments as the default for
	'format-patch'.  The value can also be a double quoted string
	which will enable attachments as the default and set the
	value as the boundary.  See the --attach option in
	linkgit:git-format-patch[1].

format.from::
	Provides the default value for the `--from` option to format-patch.
	Accepts a boolean value, or a name and email address.  If false,
	format-patch defaults to `--no-from`, using commit authors directly in
	the "From:" field of patch mails.  If true, format-patch defaults to
	`--from`, using your committer identity in the "From:" field of patch
	mails and including a "From:" field in the body of the patch mail if
	different.  If set to a non-boolean value, format-patch uses that
	value instead of your committer identity.  Defaults to false.

format.numbered::
	A boolean which can enable or disable sequence numbers in patch
	subjects.  It defaults to "auto" which enables it only if there
	is more than one patch.  It can be enabled or disabled for all
	messages by setting it to "true" or "false".  See --numbered
	option in linkgit:git-format-patch[1].

format.headers::
	Additional email headers to include in a patch to be submitted
	by mail.  See linkgit:git-format-patch[1].

format.to::
format.cc::
	Additional recipients to include in a patch to be submitted
	by mail.  See the --to and --cc options in
	linkgit:git-format-patch[1].

format.subjectPrefix::
	The default for format-patch is to output files with the '[PATCH]'
	subject prefix. Use this variable to change that prefix.

format.signature::
	The default for format-patch is to output a signature containing
	the Git version number. Use this variable to change that default.
	Set this variable to the empty string ("") to suppress
	signature generation.

format.signatureFile::
	Works just like format.signature except the contents of the
	file specified by this variable will be used as the signature.

format.suffix::
	The default for format-patch is to output files with the suffix
	`.patch`. Use this variable to change that suffix (make sure to
	include the dot if you want it).

format.pretty::
	The default pretty format for log/show/whatchanged command,
	See linkgit:git-log[1], linkgit:git-show[1],
	linkgit:git-whatchanged[1].

format.thread::
	The default threading style for 'git format-patch'.  Can be
	a boolean value, or `shallow` or `deep`.  `shallow` threading
	makes every mail a reply to the head of the series,
	where the head is chosen from the cover letter, the
	`--in-reply-to`, and the first patch mail, in this order.
	`deep` threading makes every mail a reply to the previous one.
	A true boolean value is the same as `shallow`, and a false
	value disables threading.

format.signOff::
	A boolean value which lets you enable the `-s/--signoff` option of
	format-patch by default. *Note:* Adding the Signed-off-by: line to a
	patch should be a conscious act and means that you certify you have
	the rights to submit this work under the same open source license.
	Please see the 'SubmittingPatches' document for further discussion.

format.coverLetter::
	A boolean that controls whether to generate a cover-letter when
	format-patch is invoked, but in addition can be set to "auto", to
	generate a cover-letter only when there's more than one patch.

format.outputDirectory::
	Set a custom directory to store the resulting files instead of the
	current working directory.

format.useAutoBase::
	A boolean value which lets you enable the `--base=auto` option of
	format-patch by default.
