mailinfo.scissors::
	If true, makes linkgit:git-mailinfo[1] (and therefore
	linkgit:git-am[1]) act by default as if the --scissors option
	was provided on the command-line. When active, this feature
	removes everything from the message body before a scissors
	line (i.e. consisting mainly of ">8", "8<" and "-").
