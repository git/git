clean.requireForce::
	A boolean to make git-clean refuse to delete files unless -f
	is given. Defaults to true.

clean.exclude::
	Additional exclude patterns that have higher priority than the standard
	linkgit:gitignore[5] rules and will be honored in (almost) all cases,
	even if the `-x` or `-X` options are given. These patterns are intended
	to be used for user-specific "precious" files such as IDE configuration
	that must not be removed even if a pristine build is desired. This list
	has the same priority and semantics as the `-e` command line option.

	The `--remove-excluded` command line option can be used to disregard
	these exclude patterns (intentionally no short form).
