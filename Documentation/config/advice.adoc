advice.*::
	These variables control various optional help messages designed to
	aid new users.  When left unconfigured, Git will give the message
	alongside instructions on how to squelch it.  You can tell Git
	that you have understood the issue and no longer need a specific
	help message by setting the corresponding variable to `false`.
+
As they are intended to help human users, these messages are output to
the standard error. When tools that run Git as a subprocess find them
disruptive, they can set `GIT_ADVICE=0` in the environment to squelch
all advice messages.

--
	addEmbeddedRepo::
		Shown when the user accidentally adds one
		git repo inside of another.
	addEmptyPathspec::
		Shown when the user runs `git add` without providing
		the pathspec parameter.
	addIgnoredFile::
		Shown when the user attempts to add an ignored file to
		the index.
	amWorkDir::
		Shown when linkgit:git-am[1] fails to apply a patch
		file, to tell the user the location of the file.
	ambiguousFetchRefspec::
		Shown when a fetch refspec for multiple remotes maps to
		the same remote-tracking branch namespace and causes branch
		tracking set-up to fail.
	checkoutAmbiguousRemoteBranchName::
		Shown when the argument to
		linkgit:git-checkout[1] and linkgit:git-switch[1]
		ambiguously resolves to a
		remote tracking branch on more than one remote in
		situations where an unambiguous argument would have
		otherwise caused a remote-tracking branch to be
		checked out. See the `checkout.defaultRemote`
		configuration variable for how to set a given remote
		to be used by default in some situations where this
		advice would be printed.
	commitBeforeMerge::
		Shown when linkgit:git-merge[1] refuses to
		merge to avoid overwriting local changes.
	detachedHead::
		Shown when the user uses
		linkgit:git-switch[1] or linkgit:git-checkout[1]
		to move to the detached HEAD state, to tell the user how
		to create a local branch after the fact.
	diverging::
		Shown when a fast-forward is not possible.
	fetchShowForcedUpdates::
		Shown when linkgit:git-fetch[1] takes a long time
		to calculate forced updates after ref updates, or to warn
		that the check is disabled.
	forceDeleteBranch::
		Shown when the user tries to delete a not fully merged
		branch without the force option set.
	ignoredHook::
		Shown when a hook is ignored because the hook is not
		set as executable.
	implicitIdentity::
		Shown when the user's information is guessed from the
		system username and domain name, to tell the user how to
		set their identity configuration.
	mergeConflict::
		Shown when various commands stop because of conflicts.
	nestedTag::
		Shown when a user attempts to recursively tag a tag object.
	pushAlreadyExists::
		Shown when linkgit:git-push[1] rejects an update that
		does not qualify for fast-forwarding (e.g., a tag.)
	pushFetchFirst::
		Shown when linkgit:git-push[1] rejects an update that
		tries to overwrite a remote ref that points at an
		object we do not have.
	pushNeedsForce::
		Shown when linkgit:git-push[1] rejects an update that
		tries to overwrite a remote ref that points at an
		object that is not a commit-ish, or make the remote
		ref point at an object that is not a commit-ish.
	pushNonFFCurrent::
		Shown when linkgit:git-push[1] fails due to a
		non-fast-forward update to the current branch.
	pushNonFFMatching::
		Shown when the user ran linkgit:git-push[1] and pushed
		"matching refs" explicitly (i.e. used `:`, or
		specified a refspec that isn't the current branch) and
		it resulted in a non-fast-forward error.
	pushRefNeedsUpdate::
		Shown when linkgit:git-push[1] rejects a forced update of
		a branch when its remote-tracking ref has updates that we
		do not have locally.
	pushUnqualifiedRefname::
		Shown when linkgit:git-push[1] gives up trying to
		guess based on the source and destination refs what
		remote ref namespace the source belongs in, but where
		we can still suggest that the user push to either
		`refs/heads/*` or `refs/tags/*` based on the type of the
		source object.
	pushUpdateRejected::
		Set this variable to `false` if you want to disable
		`pushNonFFCurrent`, `pushNonFFMatching`, `pushAlreadyExists`,
		`pushFetchFirst`, `pushNeedsForce`, and `pushRefNeedsUpdate`
		simultaneously.
	rebaseTodoError::
		Shown when there is an error after editing the rebase todo list.
	refSyntax::
		Shown when the user provides an illegal ref name, to
		tell the user about the ref syntax documentation.
	resetNoRefresh::
		Shown when linkgit:git-reset[1] takes more than 2
		seconds to refresh the index after reset, to tell the user
		that they can use the `--no-refresh` option.
	resolveConflict::
		Shown by various commands when conflicts
		prevent the operation from being performed.
	rmHints::
		Shown on failure in the output of linkgit:git-rm[1], to
		give directions on how to proceed from the current state.
	sequencerInUse::
		Shown when a sequencer command is already in progress.
	skippedCherryPicks::
		Shown when linkgit:git-rebase[1] skips a commit that has already
		been cherry-picked onto the upstream branch.
	sparseIndexExpanded::
		Shown when a sparse index is expanded to a full index, which is likely
		due to an unexpected set of files existing outside of the
		sparse-checkout.
	statusAheadBehind::
		Shown when linkgit:git-status[1] computes the ahead/behind
		counts for a local ref compared to its remote tracking ref,
		and that calculation takes longer than expected. Will not
		appear if `status.aheadBehind` is false or the option
		`--no-ahead-behind` is given.
	statusHints::
		Show directions on how to proceed from the current
		state in the output of linkgit:git-status[1], in
		the template shown when writing commit messages in
		linkgit:git-commit[1], and in the help message shown
		by linkgit:git-switch[1] or
		linkgit:git-checkout[1] when switching branches.
	statusUoption::
		Shown when linkgit:git-status[1] takes more than 2
		seconds to enumerate untracked files, to tell the user that
		they can use the `-u` option.
	submoduleAlternateErrorStrategyDie::
		Shown when a submodule.alternateErrorStrategy option
		configured to "die" causes a fatal error.
	submoduleMergeConflict::
		Advice shown when a non-trivial submodule merge conflict is
		encountered.
	submodulesNotUpdated::
		Shown when a user runs a submodule command that fails
		because `git submodule update --init` was not run.
	suggestDetachingHead::
		Shown when linkgit:git-switch[1] refuses to detach HEAD
		without the explicit `--detach` option.
	updateSparsePath::
		Shown when either linkgit:git-add[1] or linkgit:git-rm[1]
		is asked to update index entries outside the current sparse
		checkout.
	waitingForEditor::
		Shown when Git is waiting for editor input. Relevant
		when e.g. the editor is not launched inside the terminal.
	worktreeAddOrphan::
		Shown when the user tries to create a worktree from an
		invalid reference, to tell the user how to create a new unborn
		branch instead.
