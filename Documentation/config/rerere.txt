rerere.autoUpdate::
	When set to true, `git-rerere` updates the index with the
	resulting contents after it cleanly resolves conflicts using
	previously recorded resolution.  Defaults to false.

rerere.enabled::
	Activate recording of resolved conflicts, so that identical
	conflict hunks can be resolved automatically, should they be
	encountered again.  By default, linkgit:git-rerere[1] is
	enabled if there is an `rr-cache` directory under the
	`$GIT_DIR`, e.g. if "rerere" was previously used in the
	repository.
