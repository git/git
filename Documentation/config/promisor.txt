promisor.quiet::
	If set to "true" assume `--quiet` when fetching additional
	objects for a partial clone.

promisor.advertise::
	If set to "true", a server will use the "promisor-remote"
	capability, see linkgit:gitprotocol-v2[5], to advertise the
	promisor remotes it is using, if it uses some. Default is
	"false", which means the "promisor-remote" capability is not
	advertised.

promisor.acceptFromServer::
	If set to "all", a client will accept all the promisor remotes
	a server might advertise using the "promisor-remote"
	capability. If set to "knownName" the client will accept
	promisor remotes which are already configured on the client
	and have the same name as those advertised by the client. This
	is not very secure, but could be used in a corporate setup
	where servers and clients are trusted to not switch name and
	URLs. If set to "knownUrl", the client will accept promisor
	remotes which have both the same name and the same URL
	configured on the client as the name and URL advertised by the
	server. This is more secure than "all" or "knownUrl", so it
	should be used if possible instead of those options. Default
	is "none", which means no promisor remote advertised by a
	server will be accepted. By accepting a promisor remote, the
	client agrees that the server might omit objects that are
	lazily fetchable from this promisor remote from its responses
	to "fetch" and "clone" requests from the client. See
	linkgit:gitprotocol-v2[5].
