hook.<name>.command::
	The command to execute for `hook.<name>`. `<name>` is a unique
	"friendly" name that identifies this hook. (The hook events that
	trigger the command are configured with `hook.<name>.event`.) The
	value can be an executable path or a shell oneliner. If more than
	one value is specified for the same `<name>`, only the last value
	parsed is used. See linkgit:git-hook[1].

hook.<name>.event::
	The hook events that trigger `hook.<name>`. The value is the name
	of a hook event, like "pre-commit" or "update". (See
	linkgit:githooks[5] for a complete list of hook events.) On the
	specified event, the associated `hook.<name>.command` is executed.
	This is a multi-valued key. To run `hook.<name>` on multiple
	events, specify the key more than once. An empty value resets
	the list of events, clearing any previously defined events for
	`hook.<name>`. See linkgit:git-hook[1].

hook.<name>.enabled::
	Whether the hook `hook.<name>` is enabled. Defaults to `true`.
	Set to `false` to disable the hook without removing its
	configuration. This is particularly useful when a hook is defined
	in a system or global config file and needs to be disabled for a
	specific repository. See linkgit:git-hook[1].

hook.<name>.parallel::
	Whether the hook `hook.<name>` may run in parallel with other hooks
	for the same event. Defaults to `false`. Set to `true` only when the
	hook script is safe to run concurrently with other hooks for the same
	event. If any hook for an event does not have this set to `true`,
	all hooks for that event run sequentially regardless of `hook.jobs`.
	Only configured (named) hooks need to declare this. Traditional hooks
	found in the hooks directory do not need to, and run in parallel when
	the effective job count is greater than 1. See linkgit:git-hook[1].

hook.jobs::
	Specifies how many hooks can be run simultaneously during parallelized
	hook execution. If unspecified, defaults to 1 (serial execution).
+
This setting has no effect unless all configured hooks for the event have
`hook.<name>.parallel` set to `true`.
