hook.<name>.command::
	The command to execute for `hook.<name>`. `<name>` is a unique
	"friendly" name that identifies this hook. (The hook events that
	trigger the command are configured with `hook.<name>.event`.) The
	value can be an executable path or a shell oneliner. If more than
	one value is specified for the same `<name>`, only the last value
	parsed is used. See linkgit:git-hook[1].

hook.<name>.event::
	The hook events that trigger `hook.<name>`. The value is the name
	of a hook event, like "pre-commit" or "update". (See
	linkgit:githooks[5] for a complete list of hook events.) On the
	specified event, the associated `hook.<name>.command` is executed.
	This is a multi-valued key. To run `hook.<name>` on multiple
	events, specify the key more than once. An empty value resets
	the list of events, clearing any previously defined events for
	`hook.<name>`. See linkgit:git-hook[1].

hook.<name>.enabled::
	Whether the hook `hook.<name>` is enabled. Defaults to `true`.
	Set to `false` to disable the hook without removing its
	configuration. This is particularly useful when a hook is defined
	in a system or global config file and needs to be disabled for a
	specific repository. See linkgit:git-hook[1].

hook.<name>.parallel::
	Whether the hook `hook.<name>` may run in parallel with other hooks
	for the same event. Defaults to `false`. Set to `true` only when the
	hook script is safe to run concurrently with other hooks for the same
	event. If any hook for an event does not have this set to `true`,
	all hooks for that event run sequentially regardless of `hook.jobs`.
	Only configured (named) hooks need to declare this. Traditional hooks
	found in the hooks directory do not need to, and run in parallel when
	the effective job count is greater than 1. See linkgit:git-hook[1].

hook.<event>.jobs::
	Specifies how many hooks can be run simultaneously for the `<event>`
	hook event (e.g. `hook.post-receive.jobs = 4`). Overrides `hook.jobs`
	for this specific event. The same parallelism restrictions apply: this
	setting has no effect unless all configured hooks for the event have
	`hook.<friendly-name>.parallel` set to `true`. Must be a positive int,
	zero is rejected with a warning. See linkgit:git-hook[1].

Note on naming: although this key resembles `hook.<friendly-name>.*`
(a per-hook setting), `<event>` must be the event name, not a hook
friendly name. The key component is stored literally and looked up by
event name at runtime with no translation between the two namespaces.
A key like `hook.my-hook.jobs` is stored under `"my-hook"` but the
lookup at runtime uses the event name (e.g. `"post-receive"`), so
`hook.my-hook.jobs` is silently ignored even when `my-hook` is
registered for that event. Use `hook.post-receive.jobs` or any other
valid event name when setting `hook.<event>.jobs`.

hook.jobs::
	Specifies how many hooks can be run simultaneously during parallelized
	hook execution. If unspecified, defaults to 1 (serial execution).
	Can be overridden on a per-event basis with `hook.<event>.jobs`.
	Some hooks always run sequentially regardless of this setting because
	git knows they cannot safely be parallelized: `applypatch-msg`,
	`pre-commit`, `prepare-commit-msg`, `commit-msg`, `post-commit`,
	`post-checkout`, and `push-to-checkout`.
+
This setting has no effect unless all configured hooks for the event have
`hook.<name>.parallel` set to `true`.
+
This has no effect for hooks requiring separate output streams (like `pre-push`)
unless `extensions.hookStdoutToStderr` is enabled.

hook.forceStdoutToStderr::
	A boolean that enables the `extensions.hookStdoutToStderr` behavior
	(merging stdout to stderr for all hooks) globally. This effectively
	forces all hooks to behave as if the extension was enabled, allowing
	parallel execution for hooks like `pre-push`.
