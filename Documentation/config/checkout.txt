checkout.defaultRemote::
	When you run 'git checkout <something>'
	or 'git switch <something>' and only have one
	remote, it may implicitly fall back on checking out and
	tracking e.g. 'origin/<something>'. This stops working as soon
	as you have more than one remote with a '<something>'
	reference. This setting allows for setting the name of a
	preferred remote that should always win when it comes to
	disambiguation. The typical use-case is to set this to
	`origin`.

Currently this is used by linkgit:git-switch[1] and
linkgit:git-checkout[1] when 'git checkout <something>'
or 'git switch <something>'
will checkout the '<something>' branch on another remote,
and by linkgit:git-worktree[1] when 'git worktree add' refers to a
remote branch. This setting might be used for other checkout-like
commands or functionality in the future.
