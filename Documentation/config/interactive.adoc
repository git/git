interactive.singleKey::
	When set to true, allow the user to provide one-letter input
	with a single key (i.e., without hitting the Enter key) in
	interactive commands.  This is currently used by the `--patch`
	mode of linkgit:git-add[1], linkgit:git-checkout[1],
	linkgit:git-restore[1], linkgit:git-commit[1],
	linkgit:git-reset[1], and linkgit:git-stash[1].

interactive.diffFilter::
	When an interactive command (such as `git add --patch`) shows
	a colorized diff, git will pipe the diff through the shell
	command defined by this configuration variable. The command may
	mark up the diff further for human consumption, provided that it
	retains a one-to-one correspondence with the lines in the
	original diff. Defaults to disabled (no filtering).
