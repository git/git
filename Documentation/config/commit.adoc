`commit.cleanup`::
	This setting overrides the default of the `--cleanup` option in
	`git commit`. {see-git-commit} Changing the default can be useful
	when you always want to keep lines that begin
	with the comment character (`core.commentChar`, default `#`)
	in your log message, in which case you
	would do `git config commit.cleanup whitespace` (note that you will
	have to remove the help lines that begin with the comment character
	in the commit log template yourself, if you do this).

`commit.gpgSign`::
	A boolean to specify whether all commits should be GPG signed.
	Use of this option when doing operations such as rebase can
	result in a large number of commits being signed. It may be
	convenient to use an agent to avoid typing your GPG passphrase
	several times.

`commit.status`::
	A boolean to enable/disable inclusion of status information in the
	commit message template when using an editor to prepare the commit
	message.  Defaults to `true`.

`commit.template`::
	Specify the pathname of a file to use as the template for
	new commit messages.

`commit.verbose`::
	A boolean or int to specify the level of verbosity with `git commit`.
