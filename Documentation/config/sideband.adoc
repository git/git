sideband.allowControlCharacters::
ifdef::with-breaking-changes[]
	By default, control characters that are delivered via the sideband
	are masked, except ANSI color sequences. This prevents potentially
endif::with-breaking-changes[]
ifndef::with-breaking-changes[]
	By default, no control characters delivered via the sideband
	are masked. This is unsafe and will change in Git v3.* to only
	allow ANSI color sequences by default, preventing potentially
endif::with-breaking-changes[]
	unwanted ANSI escape sequences from being sent to the terminal. Use
	this config setting to override this behavior (the value can be
	a comma-separated list of the following keywords):
+
--
	`default`::
ifndef::with-breaking-changes[]
		Allow any control sequence. This default is unsafe and will
		change to `color` in Git v3.*.
endif::with-breaking-changes[]
	`color`::
		Allow ANSI color sequences, line feeds and horizontal tabs,
		but mask all other control characters. This is the default.
	`cursor:`:
		Allow control sequences that move the cursor. This is
		disabled by default.
	`erase`::
		Allow control sequences that erase charactrs. This is
		disabled by default.
	`false`::
		Mask all control characters other than line feeds and
		horizontal tabs.
	`true`::
		Allow all control characters to be sent to the terminal.
--

sideband.<url>.*::
	Apply the `sideband.*` option selectively to specific URLs. The
	same URL matching logic applies as for `http.<url>.*` settings.
