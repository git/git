sideband.allowControlCharacters::
	By default, control characters that are delivered via the sideband
	are masked, except ANSI color sequences. This prevents potentially
	unwanted ANSI escape sequences from being sent to the terminal. Use
	this config setting to override this behavior (the value can be
	a comma-separated list of the following keywords):
+
--
	`default`::
	`color`::
		Allow ANSI color sequences, line feeds and horizontal tabs,
		but mask all other control characters. This is the default.
	`cursor:`:
		Allow control sequences that move the cursor. This is
		disabled by default.
	`erase`::
		Allow control sequences that erase charactrs. This is
		disabled by default.
	`false`::
		Mask all control characters other than line feeds and
		horizontal tabs.
	`true`::
		Allow all control characters to be sent to the terminal.

sideband.<url>.*::
	Apply the `sideband.*` option selectively to specific URLs. The
	same URL matching logic applies as for `http.<url>.*` settings.
