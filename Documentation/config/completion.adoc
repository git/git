completion.commands::
	This is only used by git-completion.bash to add or remove
	commands from the list of completed commands. Normally only
	porcelain commands and a few select others are completed. You
	can add more commands, separated by space, in this
	variable. Prefixing the command with '-' will remove it from
	the existing list.
