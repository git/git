promisor.quiet::
	If set to "true" assume `--quiet` when fetching additional
	objects for a partial clone.

promisor.advertise::
	If set to "true", a server will use the "promisor-remote"
	capability, see linkgit:gitprotocol-v2[5], to advertise the
	promisor remotes it is using, if it uses some. Default is
	"false", which means the "promisor-remote" capability is not
	advertised.

promisor.acceptFromServer::
	If set to "all", a client will accept all the promisor remotes
	a server might advertise using the "promisor-remote"
	capability. Default is "none", which means no promisor remote
	advertised by a server will be accepted. By accepting a
	promisor remote, the client agrees that the server might omit
	objects that are lazily fetchable from this promisor remote
	from its responses to "fetch" and "clone" requests from the
	client. See linkgit:gitprotocol-v2[5].
