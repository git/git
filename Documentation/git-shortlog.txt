NAME
----
git-shortlog - Summarize 'git log' output

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
git-log --pretty=short | 'git-shortlog' [-h] [-n] [-s] [-e] [-w]
git-shortlog [-n|--numbered] [-s|--summary] [-e|--email] [-w[<width>[,<indent1>[,<indent2>]]]] [<committish>...]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Summarizes 'git log' output in a format suitable for inclusion
in release announcements. Each commit will be grouped by author and
the first line of the commit message will be shown.

Additionally, "[PATCH]" will be stripped from the commit description.

OPTIONS
-------

-h, \--help::
	Print a short usage message and exit.

-n, \--numbered::
	Sort output according to the number of commits per author instead
	of author alphabetic order.

-s, \--summary::
	Suppress commit description and provide a commit count summary only.

-e, \--email::
	Show the email address of each author.

-w[<width>[,<indent1>[,<indent2>]]]::
	Linewrap the output by wrapping each line at `width`.  The first
	line of each entry is indented by `indent1` spaces, and the second
	and subsequent lines are indented by `indent2` spaces. `width`,
	`indent1`, and `indent2` default to 76, 6 and 9 respectively.

FILES
-----

If the file `.mailmap` exists, it will be used for mapping author
email addresses to a real author name. One mapping per line, first
the author name followed by the email address enclosed by
'<' and '>'. Use hash '#' for comments. Example:

------------
# Keep alphabetized
Adam Morrow <adam@localhost.localdomain>
Eve Jones <eve@laptop.(none)>
