git-show-index(1)
=================

NAME
----
git-show-index - Show packed archive index


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git show-index'


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Read the `.idx` file for a Git packfile (created with
linkgit:git-pack-objects[1] or linkgit:git-index-pack[1]) from the
standard input, and dump its contents. The output consists of one object
per line, with each line containing two or three space-separated
columns:

  - the first column is the offset in bytes of the object within the
    corresponding packfile

  - the second column is the object id of the object

  - if the index version is 2 or higher, the third column contains the
    CRC32 of the object data

The objects are output in the order in which they are found in the index
file, which should be (in a correctly constructed file) sorted by object
id.

Note that you can get more information on a packfile by calling
linkgit:git-verify-pack[1]. However, as this command considers only the
index file itself, it's both faster and more flexible.
