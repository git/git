NAME
----
git-cvsimport-script - Import a CVS repository into git


SYNOPSIS
--------
'git-cvsimport-script' [ -o <branch-for-HEAD> ] [ -h ] [ -v ]
			[ -d <CVSROOT> ] [ -p <options-for-cvsps> ]
			[ -C <GIT_repository> ] [ -i ] [ -k ] [ <CVS_module> ]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Imports a CVS repository into git. It will either create a new
repository, or incrementally import into an existing one.

Splitting the CVS log into patch sets is done by 'cvsps'.
At least version 2.1 is required.

OPTIONS
-------
-d <CVSROOT>::
	The root of the CVS archive. May be local (a simple path) or remote;
	currently, only the :local:, :ext: and :pserver: access methods 
	are supported.

-C <target-dir>::
        The GIT repository to import to.  If the directory doesn't
        exist, it will be created.  Default is the current directory.

-i::
	Import-only: don't perform a checkout after importing.  This option
	ensures the working directory and cache remain untouched and will
	not create them if they do not exist.

-k::
	Kill keywords: will extract files with -kk from the CVS archive
	to avoid noisy changesets. Highly recommended, but off by default
	to preserve compatibility with early imported trees. 

-o <branch-for-HEAD>::
	The 'HEAD' branch from CVS is imported to the 'origin' branch within
	the git repository, as 'HEAD' already has a special meaning for git.
	Use this option if you want to import into a different branch.

	Use '-o master' for continuing an import that was initially done by
	the old cvs2git tool.

-p <options-for-cvsps>::
	Additional options for cvsps.
	The options '-u' and '-A' are implicit and should not be used here.

	If you need to pass multiple options, separate them with a comma.

-v::
	Verbosity: let 'cvsimport' report what it is doing.

<CVS_module>::
	The CVS module you want to import. Relative to <CVSROOT>.

-h::
	Print a short usage message and exit.

-z <fuzz>::
        Pass the timestamp fuzz factor to cvsps.

OUTPUT
------
If '-v' is specified, the script reports what it is doing.

Otherwise, success is indicated the Unix way, i.e. by simply exiting with
a zero exit status.
