NAME
----
git-ls-tree - List the contents of a tree object


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git ls-tree' [-d] [-r] [-t] [-l] [-z]
	    [--name-only] [--name-status] [--full-name] [--full-tree] [--abbrev[=<n>]]
	    <tree-ish> [<path>...]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Lists the contents of a given tree object, like what "/bin/ls -a" does
in the current working directory.  Note that:

 - the behaviour is slightly different from that of "/bin/ls" in that the
   '<path>' denotes just a list of patterns to match, e.g. so specifying
   directory name (without '-r') will behave differently, and order of the
   arguments does not matter.

 - the behaviour is similar to that of "/bin/ls" in that the '<path>' is
   taken as relative to the current working directory.  E.g. when you are
   in a directory 'sub' that has a directory 'dir', you can run 'git
   ls-tree -r HEAD dir' to list the contents of the tree (that is
   'sub/dir' in 'HEAD').  You don't want to give a tree that is not at the
   root level (e.g. `git ls-tree -r HEAD:sub dir`) in this case, as that
   would result in asking for 'sub/sub/dir' in the 'HEAD' commit.
   However, the current working directory can be ignored by passing
   --full-tree option.

OPTIONS
-------
<tree-ish>::
	Id of a tree-ish.

-d::
	Show only the named tree entry itself, not its children.

-r::
	Recurse into sub-trees.

-t::
	Show tree entries even when going to recurse them. Has no effect
	if '-r' was not passed. '-d' implies '-t'.

-l::
--long::
	Show object size of blob (file) entries.

-z::
	\0 line termination on output.

--name-only::
--name-status::
	List only filenames (instead of the "long" output), one per line.

--abbrev[=<n>]::
	Instead of showing the full 40-byte hexadecimal object
	lines, show only a partial prefix.
	Non default number of digits can be specified with --abbrev=<n>.

--full-name::
	Instead of showing the path names relative to the current working
	directory, show the full path names.

--full-tree::
	Do not limit the listing to the current working directory.
	Implies --full-name.

[<path>...]::
	When paths are given, show them (note that this isn't really raw
	pathnames, but rather a list of patterns to match).  Otherwise
	implicitly uses the root level of the tree as the sole path argument.


Output Format
-------------
        <mode> SP <type> SP <object> TAB <file>

Unless the `-z` option is used, TAB, LF, and backslash characters
in pathnames are represented as `\t`, `\n`, and `\\`, respectively.
This output format is compatible with what `--index-info --stdin` of
'git update-index' expects.

When the `-l` option is used, format changes to

        <mode> SP <type> SP <object> SP <object size> TAB <file>

Object size identified by <object> is given in bytes, and right-justified
with minimum width of 7 characters.  Object size is given only for blobs
(file) entries; for other entries `-` character is used in place of size.
