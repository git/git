git-history(1)
==============

NAME
----
git-history - EXPERIMENTAL: Rewrite history of the current branch

SYNOPSIS
--------
[synopsis]
git history [<options>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Rewrite history by rearranging or modifying specific commits in the
history.

THIS COMMAND IS EXPERIMENTAL. THE BEHAVIOR MAY CHANGE.

This command is similar to linkgit:git-rebase[1] and uses the same
underlying machinery. You should use rebases if you want to reapply a range of
commits onto a different base, or interactive rebases if you want to edit a
range of commits.

Note that this command does not (yet) work with histories that contain
merges. You should use linkgit:git-rebase[1] with the `--rebase-merges`
flag instead.

COMMANDS
--------

Several commands are available to rewrite history in different ways:
