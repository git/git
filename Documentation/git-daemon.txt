git-daemon(1)
=============

NAME
----
git-daemon - A really simple server for GIT repositories.

SYNOPSIS
--------
'git-daemon' [--inetd | --port=n]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
A really simple TCP git daemon that normally listens on port "DEFAULT_GIT_PORT"
aka 9418. It waits for a connection, and will just execute "git-upload-pack"
when it gets one.

It's careful in that there's a magic request-line that gives the command and
what directory to upload, and it verifies that the directory is ok.

It verifies that the directory has the magic file "git-daemon-export-ok", and
it will refuse to export any git directory that hasn't explicitly been marked
for export this way.

This is ideally suited for read-only updates, ie pulling from git repositories.

OPTIONS
-------
--inetd::
	Have the server run as an inetd service.

--port::
	Listen on an alternative port.
