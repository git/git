NAME
----
git-update-ref - Update the object name stored in a ref safely

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git update-ref' [-m <reason>] [--no-deref] (-d <ref> [<oldvalue>] | [--create-reflog] <ref> <newvalue> [<oldvalue>] | --stdin [-z])

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Given two arguments, stores the <newvalue> in the <ref>, possibly
dereferencing the symbolic refs.  E.g. `git update-ref HEAD
<newvalue>` updates the current branch head to the new object.

Given three arguments, stores the <newvalue> in the <ref>,
possibly dereferencing the symbolic refs, after verifying that
the current value of the <ref> matches <oldvalue>.
E.g. `git update-ref refs/heads/master <newvalue> <oldvalue>`
updates the master branch head to <newvalue> only if its current
value is <oldvalue>.  You can specify 40 "0" or an empty string
as <oldvalue> to make sure that the ref you are creating does
not exist.

It also allows a "ref" file to be a symbolic pointer to another
ref file by starting with the four-byte header sequence of
"ref:".

More importantly, it allows the update of a ref file to follow
these symbolic pointers, whether they are symlinks or these
"regular file symbolic refs".  It follows *real* symlinks only
if they start with "refs/": otherwise it will just try to read
them and update them as a regular file (i.e. it will allow the
filesystem to follow them, but will overwrite such a symlink to
somewhere else with a regular filename).

If --no-deref is given, <ref> itself is overwritten, rather than
the result of following the symbolic pointers.

In general, using

	git update-ref HEAD "$head"

should be a _lot_ safer than doing

	echo "$head" > "$GIT_DIR/HEAD"

both from a symlink following standpoint *and* an error checking
standpoint.  The "refs/" rule for symlinks means that symlinks
that point to "outside" the tree are safe: they'll be followed
for reading but not for writing (so we'll never write through a
ref symlink to some other tree, if you have copied a whole
archive by creating a symlink tree).

With `-d` flag, it deletes the named <ref> after verifying it
still contains <oldvalue>.

With `--stdin`, update-ref reads instructions from standard input and
performs all modifications together.  Specify commands of the form:

	update SP <ref> SP <newvalue> [SP <oldvalue>] LF
	create SP <ref> SP <newvalue> LF
	delete SP <ref> [SP <oldvalue>] LF
	verify SP <ref> [SP <oldvalue>] LF
	option SP <opt> LF
	start LF
	prepare LF
	commit LF
	abort LF

With `--create-reflog`, update-ref will create a reflog for each ref
even if one would not ordinarily be created.

Quote fields containing whitespace as if they were strings in C source
code; i.e., surrounded by double-quotes and with backslash escapes.
Use 40 "0" characters or the empty string to specify a zero value.  To
specify a missing value, omit the value and its preceding SP entirely.

Alternatively, use `-z` to specify in NUL-terminated format, without
quoting:

	update SP <ref> NUL <newvalue> NUL [<oldvalue>] NUL
	create SP <ref> NUL <newvalue> NUL
	delete SP <ref> NUL [<oldvalue>] NUL
	verify SP <ref> NUL [<oldvalue>] NUL
	option SP <opt> NUL
	start NUL
	prepare NUL
	commit NUL
	abort NUL

In this format, use 40 "0" to specify a zero value, and use the empty
string to specify a missing value.

In either format, values can be specified in any form that Git
recognizes as an object name.  Commands in any other format or a
repeated <ref> produce an error.  Command meanings are:

update::
	Set <ref> to <newvalue> after verifying <oldvalue>, if given.
	Specify a zero <newvalue> to ensure the ref does not exist
	after the update and/or a zero <oldvalue> to make sure the
	ref does not exist before the update.

create::
	Create <ref> with <newvalue> after verifying it does not
	exist.  The given <newvalue> may not be zero.

delete::
	Delete <ref> after verifying it exists with <oldvalue>, if
	given.  If given, <oldvalue> may not be zero.

verify::
	Verify <ref> against <oldvalue> but do not change it.  If
	<oldvalue> is zero or missing, the ref must not exist.

option::
	Modify behavior of the next command naming a <ref>.
	The only valid option is `no-deref` to avoid dereferencing
	a symbolic ref.

start::
	Start a transaction. In contrast to a non-transactional session, a
	transaction will automatically abort if the session ends without an
	explicit commit. This command may create a new empty transaction when
	the current one has been committed or aborted already.

prepare::
	Prepare to commit the transaction. This will create lock files for all
	queued reference updates. If one reference could not be locked, the
	transaction will be aborted.

commit::
	Commit all reference updates queued for the transaction, ending the
	transaction.

abort::
	Abort the transaction, releasing all locks if the transaction is in
	prepared state.

If all <ref>s can be locked with matching <oldvalue>s
simultaneously, all modifications are performed.  Otherwise, no
modifications are performed.  Note that while each individual
<ref> is updated or deleted atomically, a concurrent reader may
still see a subset of the modifications.

LOGGING UPDATES
---------------
If config parameter "core.logAllRefUpdates" is true and the ref is one
under "refs/heads/", "refs/remotes/", "refs/notes/", or a pseudoref
like HEAD or ORIG_HEAD; or the file "$GIT_DIR/logs/<ref>" exists then
`git update-ref` will append a line to the log file
"$GIT_DIR/logs/<ref>" (dereferencing all symbolic refs before creating
the log name) describing the change in ref value.  Log lines are
formatted as:

    oldsha1 SP newsha1 SP committer LF

Where "oldsha1" is the 40 character hexadecimal value previously
stored in <ref>, "newsha1" is the 40 character hexadecimal value of
<newvalue> and "committer" is the committer's name, email address
and date in the standard Git committer ident format.

Optionally with -m:

    oldsha1 SP newsha1 SP committer TAB message LF

Where all fields are as described above and "message" is the
value supplied to the -m option.

An update will fail (without changing <ref>) if the current user is
unable to create a new log file, append to the existing log file
or does not have committer information available.
