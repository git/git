GIT v1.6.6 Release Notes
========================

In this release, "git fsck" defaults to "git fsck --full" and checks
packfiles, and because of this it will take much longer to complete
than before.  If you prefer a quicker check only on loose objects (the
old default), you can say "git fsck --no-full".  This has been
supported by 1.5.4 and newer versions of git, so it is safe to write
it in your script even if you use slightly older git on some of your
machines.

In git 1.7.0, which is planned to be the release after 1.6.6, "git
push" into a branch that is currently checked out will be refused by
default.

You can choose what should happen upon such a push by setting the
configuration variable receive.denyCurrentBranch in the receiving
repository.

Also, "git push $there :$killed" to delete the branch $killed in a remote
repository $there, when $killed branch is the current branch pointed at by
its HEAD, will be refused by default.

You can choose what should happen upon such a push by setting the
configuration variable receive.denyDeleteCurrent in the receiving
repository.

To ease the transition plan, the receiving repository of such a
push running this release will issue a big warning when the
configuration variable is missing.  Please refer to:

transition plan.

Updates since v1.6.5
--------------------

(subsystems)

(portability)

(performance)

(usability, bells and whistles)

 * "git fsck" by default checks the packfiles (i.e. "--full" is the
   default); you can turn it off with "git fsck --no-full".

 * "git log --decorate" shows the location of HEAD as well.

(developers)

Fixes since v1.6.5
------------------

All of the fixes in v1.6.5.X maintenance series are included in this
release, unless otherwise noted.

 * "git apply" and "git diff" (including patch output from "git log -p")
   now flags trailing blank lines as whitespace errors correctly (only
   "apply --whitespace=fix" stripped them but "apply --whitespace=warn"
   did not even warn).

 * Two whitespace error classes, 'blank-at-eof' and 'blank-at-eol', have
   been introduced (settable by core.whitespace configuration variable and
   whitespace attribute).  The 'trailing-space' whitespace error class has
   become a short-hand to cover both of these and there is no behaviour
   change for existing set-ups.
