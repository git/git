-p::
	Generate patch (see section on generating patches)

-u::
	Synonym for "-p".

-r::
	Look recursively in subdirectories; this flag does not
	mean anything to commands other than "git-diff-tree";
	other diff commands always look at all the subdirectories.

-z::
	\0 line termination on output

--name-only::
	Show only names of changed files.

--name-only-z::
	Same as --name-only, but terminate lines with NUL.

-B::
	Break complete rewrite changes into pairs of delete and create.

-M::
	Detect renames.

-C::
	Detect copies as well as renames.

--find-copies-harder::
	By default, -C option finds copies only if the original
	file of the copy was modified in the same changeset for
	performance reasons.  This flag makes the command
	inspect unmodified files as candidates for the source of
	copy.  This is a very expensive operation for large
	projects, so use it with caution.

-l<num>::
	-M and -C options require O(n^2) processing time where n
	in the number of potential rename/copy targets.  This
	option prevents rename/copy detection from running if
	the number of rename/copy targets exceed the specified
	number.

-S<string>::
	Look for differences that contains the change in <string>.

--pickaxe-all::
	When -S finds a change, show all the changes in that
	changeset, not just the files that contains the change
	in <string>.

-O<orderfile>::
	Output the patch in the order specified in the
	<orderfile>, which has one shell glob pattern per line.

-R::
	Swap two inputs; that is, show differences from cache or
	on-disk file to tree contents.
