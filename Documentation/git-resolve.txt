git-resolve(1)
==============
v0.99.5, Aug 2005

NAME
----
git-resolve - Merge two commits


SYNOPSIS
--------
'git resolve' <current> <merged> <message>

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Given two commits and a merge message, merge the <merged> commit
into <current> commit, with the commit log message <message>.

When <current> is a descendant of <merged>, or <current> is an
ancestor of <merged>, no new commit is created and the <message>
is ignored.  The former is informally called "already up to
date", and the latter is often called "fast forward".
