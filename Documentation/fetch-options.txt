-q, \--quiet::
	Pass --quiet to git-fetch-pack and silence any other internally
	used programs.

-v, \--verbose::
	Be verbose.

-a, \--append::
	Append ref names and object names of fetched refs to the
	existing contents of `.git/FETCH_HEAD`.  Without this
	option old data in `.git/FETCH_HEAD` will be overwritten.

\--upload-pack <upload-pack>::
	When given, and the repository to fetch from is handled
	by 'git-fetch-pack', '--exec=<upload-pack>' is passed to
	the command to specify non-default path for the command
	run on the other end.

-f, \--force::
	When `git-fetch` is used with `<rbranch>:<lbranch>`
	refspec, it refuses to update the local branch
	`<lbranch>` unless the remote branch `<rbranch>` it
	fetches is a descendant of `<lbranch>`.  This option
	overrides that check.

-n, \--no-tags::
	By default, `git-fetch` fetches tags that point at
	objects that are downloaded from the remote repository
	and stores them locally.  This option disables this
	automatic tag following.

-t, \--tags::
	Most of the tags are fetched automatically as branch
	heads are downloaded, but tags that do not point at
	objects reachable from the branch heads that are being
	tracked will not be fetched by this mechanism.  This
	flag lets all tags and their associated objects be
	downloaded.

-k, \--keep::
	Keep downloaded pack.

-u, \--update-head-ok::
	By default `git-fetch` refuses to update the head which
	corresponds to the current branch.  This flag disables the
	check.  This is purely for the internal use for `git-pull`
	to communicate with `git-fetch`, and unless you are
	implementing your own Porcelain you are not supposed to
	use it.

\--depth=<depth>::
	Deepen the history of a 'shallow' repository created by
	`git clone` with `--depth=<depth>` option (see gitlink:git-clone[1])
	by the specified number of commits.
