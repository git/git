GIT v1.5.3.5 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.5.3.4
--------------------

 * "git-config" silently ignored options after --list; now it wilh
   error out with a usage message.

 * "git-config --file" failed if the argument used a relative path
   as it changed directories before opening the file.

 * "git-add -i" did not handle single line hunks correctly.

 * "git-log --follow" did not work unless diff generation (e.g. -p)
   was also requested.

 * "git-log" printed extra newlines between commits when a diff
   was generated internally (e.g. -S or --follow) but not displayed.

 * Documention updates for supported (but previously undocumented)
   options of "git-archive" and "git-reflog".

 * "make clean" no longer deletes the configure script that ships
   with the git tarball, making multiple architecture builds easier.
