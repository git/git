NAME
----
git-push - Update remote refs along with associated objects


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git-push' [--all] [--dry-run] [--tags] [--receive-pack=<git-receive-pack>]
           [--repo=all] [-f | --force] [-v | --verbose] [<repository> <refspec>...]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Updates remote refs using local refs, while sending objects
necessary to complete the given refs.

You can make interesting things happen to a repository
every time you push into it, by setting up 'hooks' there.  See
documentation for linkgit:git-receive-pack[1].


OPTIONS
-------
<repository>::
	The "remote" repository that is destination of a push
	operation.  See the section <<URLS,GIT URLS>> below.

<refspec>::
	The canonical format of a <refspec> parameter is
	`+?<src>:<dst>`; that is, an optional plus `+`, followed
	by the source ref, followed by a colon `:`, followed by
	the destination ref.
+
The <src> side can be an
arbitrary "SHA1 expression" that can be used as an
argument to `git-cat-file -t`.  E.g. `master~4` (push
four parents before the current master head).
+
The local ref that matches <src> is used
to fast forward the remote ref that matches <dst>.  If
the optional plus `+` is used, the remote ref is updated
even if it does not result in a fast forward update.
+
Note: If no explicit refspec is found, (that is neither
on the command line nor in any Push line of the
corresponding remotes file---see below), then "matching" heads are
pushed: for every head that exists on the local side, the remote side is
updated if a head of the same name already exists on the remote side.
+
`tag <tag>` means the same as `refs/tags/<tag>:refs/tags/<tag>`.
+
A parameter <ref> without a colon pushes the <ref> from the source
repository to the destination repository under the same name.
+
Pushing an empty <src> allows you to delete the <dst> ref from
the remote repository.

\--all::
	Instead of naming each ref to push, specifies that all
	refs under `$GIT_DIR/refs/heads/` be pushed.

\--mirror::
	Instead of naming each ref to push, specifies that all
	refs under `$GIT_DIR/refs/heads/` and `$GIT_DIR/refs/tags/`
	be mirrored to the remote repository.  Newly created local
	refs will be pushed to the remote end, locally updated refs
	will be force updated on the remote end, and deleted refs
	will be removed from the remote end.

\--dry-run::
	Do everything except actually send the updates.

\--tags::
	All refs under `$GIT_DIR/refs/tags` are pushed, in
	addition to refspecs explicitly listed on the command
	line.

\--receive-pack=<git-receive-pack>::
	Path to the 'git-receive-pack' program on the remote
	end.  Sometimes useful when pushing to a remote
	repository over ssh, and you do not have the program in
	a directory on the default $PATH.

\--exec=<git-receive-pack>::
	Same as \--receive-pack=<git-receive-pack>.

-f, \--force::
	Usually, the command refuses to update a remote ref that is
	not an ancestor of the local ref used to overwrite it.
	This flag disables the check.  This can cause the
	remote repository to lose commits; use it with care.

\--repo=<repo>::
	When no repository is specified the command defaults to
	"origin"; this overrides it.

\--thin, \--no-thin::
	These options are passed to `git-send-pack`.  Thin
	transfer spends extra cycles to minimize the number of
	objects to be sent and meant to be used on slower connection.

-v, \--verbose::
	Run verbosely.

OUTPUT
------

The output of "git push" depends on the transport method used; this
section describes the output when pushing over the git protocol (either
locally or via ssh).

The status of the push is output in tabular form, with each line
representing the status of a single ref. Each line is of the form:

-------------------------------
 <flag> <summary> <from> -> <to> (<reason>)
-------------------------------

flag::
	A single character indicating the status of the ref. This is
	blank for a successfully pushed ref, `!` for a ref that was
	rejected or failed to push, and '=' for a ref that was up to
	date and did not need pushing (note that the status of up to
	date refs is shown only when `git push` is running verbosely).

summary::
	For a successfully pushed ref, the summary shows the old and new
	values of the ref in a form suitable for using as an argument to
	`git log` (this is `<old>..<new>` in most cases, and
	`<old>...<new>` for forced non-fast forward updates). For a
	failed update, more details are given for the failure.
	The string `rejected` indicates that git did not try to send the
	ref at all (typically because it is not a fast forward). The
	string `remote rejected` indicates that the remote end refused
	the update; this rejection is typically caused by a hook on the
	remote side. The string `remote failure` indicates that the
	remote end did not report the successful update of the ref
	(perhaps because of a temporary error on the remote side, a
	break in the network connection, or other transient error).

from::
	The name of the local ref being pushed, minus its
	`refs/<type>/` prefix. In the case of deletion, the
	name of the local ref is omitted.

to::
	The name of the remote ref being updated, minus its
	`refs/<type>/` prefix.

reason::
	A human-readable explanation. In the case of successfully pushed
	refs, no explanation is needed. For a failed ref, the reason for
	failure is described.

Examples
--------

git push origin master::
	Find a ref that matches `master` in the source repository
	(most likely, it would find `refs/heads/master`), and update
	the same ref (e.g. `refs/heads/master`) in `origin` repository
	with it.

git push origin :experimental::
	Find a ref that matches `experimental` in the `origin` repository
	(e.g. `refs/heads/experimental`), and delete it.

git push origin master:satellite/master::
	Find a ref that matches `master` in the source repository
	(most likely, it would find `refs/heads/master`), and update
	the ref that matches `satellite/master` (most likely, it would
	be `refs/remotes/satellite/master`) in `origin` repository with it.

git push origin master:refs/heads/experimental::
	Create the branch `experimental` in the `origin` repository
	by copying the current `master` branch.  This form is usually
	needed to create a new branch in the remote repository as
	there is no `experimental` branch to match.
