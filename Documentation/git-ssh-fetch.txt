'git-ssh-fetch' [-c] [-t] [-a] [-d] [-v] [-w filename] [--recover] commit-id url

DESCRIPTION

Pulls from a remote repository over ssh connection, invoking
git-ssh-upload on the other end. It functions identically to
git-ssh-upload, aside from which end you run it on.

        Either the hash or the filename under [URL]/refs/ to
        pull.

-c::
	Get the commit objects.
-t::
	Get trees associated with the commit objects.
-a::
	Get all the objects.
-v::
	Report what is downloaded.
-w::
        Writes the commit-id into the filename under $GIT_DIR/refs/ on
        the local end after the transfer is complete.
