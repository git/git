git-whatchanged(1)
==================

NAME
----
git-whatchanged - Show logs with difference each commit introduces


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git whatchanged' <option>...

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Shows commit logs and diff output each commit introduces.  The
command internally invokes 'git rev-list' piped to
'git diff-tree', and takes command line options for both of
these commands.

This manual page describes only the most frequently used options.


OPTIONS
-------
-p::
	Show textual diffs, instead of the git internal diff
	output format that is useful only to tell the changed
	paths and their nature of changes.

-<n>::
	Limit output to <n> commits.

<since>..<until>::
	Limit output to between the two named commits (bottom
	exclusive, top inclusive).

-r::
	Show git internal diff output, but for the whole tree,
	not just the top level.

-m::
	By default, differences for merge commits are not shown.
	With this flag, show differences to that commit from all
	of its parents.
+
However, it is not very useful in general, although it
*is* useful on a file-by-file basis.

Examples
--------
`git whatchanged -p v2.6.12.. include/scsi drivers/scsi`::

	Show as patches the commits since version 'v2.6.12' that changed
	any file in the include/scsi or drivers/scsi subdirectories

`git whatchanged --since="2 weeks ago" \-- gitk`::

	Show the changes during the last two weeks to the file 'gitk'.
	The "--" is necessary to avoid confusion with the *branch* named
	'gitk'
