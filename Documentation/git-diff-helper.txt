==================
v0.1, May 2005

NAME
----
git-diff-helper - Generates patch format output for git-diff-*


SYNOPSIS
--------
'git-diff-helper' [-z] [-R] [-M]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Reads output from "git-diff-cache", "git-diff-tree" and "git-diff-files" and
generates patch format output.

OPTIONS
-------
-z::
	\0 line termination on input

-R::
	Output diff in reverse.  This is useful for displaying output from
	"git-diff-cache" which always compares tree with cache or working
	file.  E.g.

		git-diff-cache <tree> | git-diff-helper -R file.c

	would show a diff to bring the working file back to what
	is in the <tree>.

-M::
	Detect renames.
