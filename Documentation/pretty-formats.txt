PRETTY FORMATS
--------------

If the commit is a merge, and if the pretty-format
is not 'oneline', 'email' or 'raw', an additional line is
inserted before the 'Author:' line.  This line begins with
"Merge: " and the sha1s of ancestral commits are printed,
separated by spaces.  Note that the listed commits may not
necessarily be the list of the *direct* parent commits if you
have limited your view of history: for example, if you are
only interested in changes related to a certain directory or
file.

There are several built-in formats, and you can define
additional formats by setting a pretty.<name>
config option to either another format name, or a
'format:' string, as described below (see
linkgit:git-config[1]). Here are the details of the
built-in formats:

* 'oneline'

	  <sha1> <title line>
+
This is designed to be as compact as possible.

* 'short'

	  commit <sha1>
	  Author: <author>

	      <title line>

* 'medium'

	  commit <sha1>
	  Author: <author>
	  Date:   <author date>

	      <title line>

	      <full commit message>

* 'full'

	  commit <sha1>
	  Author: <author>
	  Commit: <committer>

	      <title line>

	      <full commit message>

* 'fuller'

	  commit <sha1>
	  Author:     <author>
	  AuthorDate: <author date>
	  Commit:     <committer>
	  CommitDate: <committer date>

	       <title line>

	       <full commit message>

* 'email'

	  From <sha1> <date>
	  From: <author>
	  Date: <author date>
	  Subject: [PATCH] <title line>

	  <full commit message>

* 'raw'
+
The 'raw' format shows the entire commit exactly as
stored in the commit object.  Notably, the SHA-1s are
displayed in full, regardless of whether --abbrev or
--no-abbrev are used, and 'parents' information show the
true parent commits, without taking grafts or history
simplification into account. Note that this format affects the way
commits are displayed, but not the way the diff is shown e.g. with
`git log --raw`. To get full object names in a raw diff format,
use `--no-abbrev`.

* 'format:<string>'
+
The 'format:<string>' format allows you to specify which information
you want to show. It works a little bit like printf format,
with the notable exception that you get a newline with '%n'
instead of '\n'.
+
E.g, 'format:"The author of %h was %an, %ar%nThe title was >>%s<<%n"'
would show something like this:
+
-------
The author of fe6e0ee was Junio C Hamano, 23 hours ago
The title was >>t4119: test autocomputing -p<n> for traditional diff input.<<

-------
+
The placeholders are:

- '%H': commit hash
- '%h': abbreviated commit hash
- '%T': tree hash
- '%t': abbreviated tree hash
- '%P': parent hashes
- '%p': abbreviated parent hashes
- '%an': author name
- '%aN': author name (respecting .mailmap, see linkgit:git-shortlog[1]
  or linkgit:git-blame[1])
- '%ae': author email
- '%aE': author email (respecting .mailmap, see
  linkgit:git-shortlog[1] or linkgit:git-blame[1])
- '%ad': author date (format respects --date= option)
- '%aD': author date, RFC2822 style
- '%ar': author date, relative
- '%at': author date, UNIX timestamp
- '%ai': author date, ISO 8601-like format
- '%aI': author date, strict ISO 8601 format
- '%cn': committer name
- '%cN': committer name (respecting .mailmap, see
  linkgit:git-shortlog[1] or linkgit:git-blame[1])
- '%ce': committer email
- '%cE': committer email (respecting .mailmap, see
  linkgit:git-shortlog[1] or linkgit:git-blame[1])
- '%cd': committer date (format respects --date= option)
- '%cD': committer date, RFC2822 style
- '%cr': committer date, relative
- '%ct': committer date, UNIX timestamp
- '%ci': committer date, ISO 8601-like format
- '%cI': committer date, strict ISO 8601 format
- '%d': ref names, like the --decorate option of linkgit:git-log[1]
- '%D': ref names without the " (", ")" wrapping.
- '%e': encoding
- '%s': subject
- '%f': sanitized subject line, suitable for a filename
- '%b': body
- '%B': raw body (unwrapped subject and body)
ifndef::git-rev-list[]
- '%N': commit notes
endif::git-rev-list[]
- '%GG': raw verification message from GPG for a signed commit
- '%G?': show "G" for a Good signature, "B" for a Bad signature, "U" for a good,
  untrusted signature and "N" for no signature
- '%GS': show the name of the signer for a signed commit
- '%GK': show the key used to sign a signed commit
- '%gD': reflog selector, e.g., `refs/stash@{1}`
- '%gd': shortened reflog selector, e.g., `stash@{1}`
- '%gn': reflog identity name
- '%gN': reflog identity name (respecting .mailmap, see
  linkgit:git-shortlog[1] or linkgit:git-blame[1])
- '%ge': reflog identity email
- '%gE': reflog identity email (respecting .mailmap, see
  linkgit:git-shortlog[1] or linkgit:git-blame[1])
- '%gs': reflog subject
- '%Cred': switch color to red
- '%Cgreen': switch color to green
- '%Cblue': switch color to blue
- '%Creset': reset color
- '%C(...)': color specification, as described in color.branch.* config option;
  adding `auto,` at the beginning will emit color only when colors are
  enabled for log output (by `color.diff`, `color.ui`, or `--color`, and
  respecting the `auto` settings of the former if we are going to a
  terminal). `auto` alone (i.e. `%C(auto)`) will turn on auto coloring
  on the next placeholders until the color is switched again.
- '%m': left, right or boundary mark
- '%n': newline
- '%%': a raw '%'
- '%x00': print a byte from a hex code
- '%w([<w>[,<i1>[,<i2>]]])': switch line wrapping, like the -w option of
  linkgit:git-shortlog[1].
- '%<(<N>[,trunc|ltrunc|mtrunc])': make the next placeholder take at
  least N columns, padding spaces on the right if necessary.
  Optionally truncate at the beginning (ltrunc), the middle (mtrunc)
  or the end (trunc) if the output is longer than N columns.
  Note that truncating only works correctly with N >= 2.
- '%<|(<N>)': make the next placeholder take at least until Nth
  columns, padding spaces on the right if necessary
- '%>(<N>)', '%>|(<N>)': similar to '%<(<N>)', '%<|(<N>)'
  respectively, but padding spaces on the left
- '%>>(<N>)', '%>>|(<N>)': similar to '%>(<N>)', '%>|(<N>)'
  respectively, except that if the next placeholder takes more spaces
  than given and there are spaces on its left, use those spaces
- '%><(<N>)', '%><|(<N>)': similar to '% <(<N>)', '%<|(<N>)'
  respectively, but padding both sides (i.e. the text is centered)

NOTE: Some placeholders may depend on other options given to the
revision traversal engine. For example, the `%g*` reflog options will
insert an empty string unless we are traversing reflog entries (e.g., by
`git log -g`). The `%d` and `%D` placeholders will use the "short"
decoration format if `--decorate` was not already provided on the command
line.

If you add a `+` (plus sign) after '%' of a placeholder, a line-feed
is inserted immediately before the expansion if and only if the
placeholder expands to a non-empty string.

If you add a `-` (minus sign) after '%' of a placeholder, line-feeds that
immediately precede the expansion are deleted if and only if the
placeholder expands to an empty string.

If you add a ` ` (space) after '%' of a placeholder, a space
is inserted immediately before the expansion if and only if the
placeholder expands to a non-empty string.

* 'tformat:'
+
The 'tformat:' format works exactly like 'format:', except that it
provides "terminator" semantics instead of "separator" semantics. In
other words, each commit has the message terminator character (usually a
newline) appended, rather than a separator placed between entries.
This means that the final entry of a single-line format will be properly
terminated with a new line, just as the "oneline" format does.
For example:
+
---------------------
$ git log -2 --pretty=format:%h 4da45bef \
  | perl -pe '$_ .= " -- NO NEWLINE\n" unless /\n/'
4da45be
7134973 -- NO NEWLINE

$ git log -2 --pretty=tformat:%h 4da45bef \
  | perl -pe '$_ .= " -- NO NEWLINE\n" unless /\n/'
4da45be
7134973
---------------------
+
In addition, any unrecognized string that has a `%` in it is interpreted
as if it has `tformat:` in front of it.  For example, these two are
equivalent:
+
---------------------
$ git log -2 --pretty=tformat:%h 4da45bef
$ git log -2 --pretty=%h 4da45bef
---------------------
