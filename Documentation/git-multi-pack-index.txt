NAME
----
git-multi-pack-index - Write and verify multi-pack-indexes


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git multi-pack-index' [--object-dir=<dir>] <subcommand>

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Write or verify a multi-pack-index (MIDX) file.

OPTIONS
-------

--object-dir=<dir>::
	Use given directory for the location of Git objects. We check
	`<dir>/packs/multi-pack-index` for the current MIDX file, and
	`<dir>/packs` for the pack-files to index.

The following subcommands are available:

write::
	Write a new MIDX file.

verify::
	Verify the contents of the MIDX file.

expire::
	Delete the pack-files that are tracked 	by the MIDX file, but
	have no objects referenced by the MIDX. Rewrite the MIDX file
	afterward to remove all references to these pack-files.

repack::
	Create a new pack-file containing objects in small pack-files
	referenced by the multi-pack-index. If the size given by the
	`--batch-size=<size>` argument is zero, then create a pack
	containing all objects referenced by the multi-pack-index. For
	a non-zero batch size, Select the pack-files by examining packs
	from oldest-to-newest, computing the "expected size" by counting
	the number of objects in the pack referenced by the
	multi-pack-index, then divide by the total number of objects in
	the pack and multiply by the pack size. We select packs with
	expected size below the batch size until the set of packs have
	total expected size at least the batch size. If the total size
	does not reach the batch size, then do nothing. If a new pack-
	file is created, rewrite the multi-pack-index to reference the
	new pack-file. A later run of 'git multi-pack-index expire' will
	delete the pack-files that were part of this batch.


EXAMPLES
--------

* Write a MIDX file for the packfiles in the current .git folder.
+
-----------------------------------------------
$ git multi-pack-index write
-----------------------------------------------

* Write a MIDX file for the packfiles in an alternate object store.
+
-----------------------------------------------
$ git multi-pack-index --object-dir <alt> write
-----------------------------------------------

* Verify the MIDX file for the packfiles in the current .git folder.
+
-----------------------------------------------
$ git multi-pack-index verify
-----------------------------------------------
