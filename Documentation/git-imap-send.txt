NAME
----
git-imap-send - Dump a mailbox from stdin into an imap folder


SYNOPSIS
--------
'git-imap-send'


DESCRIPTION

This command uploads a mailbox generated with git-format-patch
into an imap drafts folder.  This allows patches to be sent as
other email is sent with mail clients that cannot read mailbox
files directly.

Typical usage is something like:

git-format-patch --signoff --stdout --attach origin | git-imap-send


CONFIGURATION
-------------

git-imap-send requires the following values in the repository
configuration file (shown with examples):

..........................
[imap]
    Folder = "INBOX.Drafts"

[imap]
    Tunnel = "ssh -q user@server.com /usr/bin/imapd ./Maildir 2> /dev/null"

[imap]
    Host = imap.server.com
    User = bob
    Pass = pwd
    Port = 143
