NAME
----
git-ssh-pull - Pulls from a remote repository over ssh connection



SYNOPSIS
--------
'git-ssh-pull' [-c] [-t] [-a] [-d] [-v] [-w filename] [--recover] commit-id url

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Pulls from a remote repository over ssh connection, invoking
git-ssh-push on the other end. It functions identically to
git-ssh-push, aside from which end you run it on.


OPTIONS
-------
commit-id::
        Either the hash or the filename under [URL]/refs/ to
        pull.

-c::
	Get the commit objects.
-t::
	Get trees associated with the commit objects.
-a::
	Get all the objects.
-d::
	Do not check for delta base objects (use this option
	only when you know the remote repository is not
	deltified).
--recover::
	Check dependency of deltified object more carefully than
	usual, to recover after earlier pull that was interrupted.
-v::
	Report what is downloaded.
-w::
        Writes the commit-id into the filename under $GIT_DIR/refs/ on
        the local end after the transfer is complete.
