git-peek-remote(1)
==================

NAME
----
git-peek-remote - List the references in a remote repository


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git peek-remote' [--upload-pack=<git-upload-pack>] [<host>:]<directory>

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This command is deprecated; use 'git ls-remote' instead.

OPTIONS
-------
--upload-pack=<git-upload-pack>::
	Use this to specify the path to 'git-upload-pack' on the
	remote side, if it is not found on your $PATH. Some
	installations of sshd ignores the user's environment
	setup scripts for login shells (e.g. .bash_profile) and
	your privately installed git may not be found on the system
	default $PATH.  Another workaround suggested is to set
	up your $PATH in ".bashrc", but this flag is for people
	who do not want to pay the overhead for non-interactive
	shells, but prefer having a lean .bashrc file (they set most of
	the things up in .bash_profile).

<host>::
	A remote host that houses the repository.  When this
	part is specified, 'git-upload-pack' is invoked via
	ssh.

<directory>::
	The repository to sync from.
