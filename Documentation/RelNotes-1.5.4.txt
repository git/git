========================

Updates since v1.5.3
--------------------

 * Comes with much improved gitk.

 * git-reset is now built-in.

 * git-send-email can optionally talk over ssmtp and use SMTP-AUTH.

 * git-rebase learned --whitespace option.

 * git-remote knows --mirror mode.

 * git-merge can call the "post-merge" hook.

 * git-archive can optionally substitute keywords in files marked with
   export-subst attribute.

 * git-for-each-ref learned %(xxxdate:<dateformat>) syntax to
   show the various date fields in different formats.

 * git-gc --auto is a low-impact way to automatically run a
   variant of git-repack that does not lose unreferenced objects
   (read: safer than the usual one) after the user accumulates
   too many loose objects.

 * git-push has been rewritten in C.

   if a push is run.

 * git-am and git-rebase are far less verbose.

 * git-pull learned to pass --[no-]ff option to underlying git-merge.

   option.
