[verse]
'git clone' [--template=<template_directory>]
	  [-l] [-s] [--no-hardlinks] [-q] [-n] [--bare] [--mirror]
	  [-o <name>] [-b <name>] [-u <upload-pack>] [--reference <repository>]

	  [--recursive|--recurse-submodules] [--] <repository>
	  [<directory>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Clones a repository into a newly created directory, creates
remote-tracking branches for each branch in the cloned repository
(visible using `git branch -r`), and creates and checks out an
initial branch that is forked from the cloned repository's
currently active branch.

After the clone, a plain `git fetch` without arguments will update
all the remote-tracking branches, and a `git pull` without
arguments will in addition merge the remote master branch into the
current master branch, if any (this is untrue when "--single-branch"
is given; see below).

This default configuration is achieved by creating references to
the remote branch heads under `refs/remotes/origin` and
by initializing `remote.origin.url` and `remote.origin.fetch`
configuration variables.


OPTIONS
-------
--local::
-l::
	When the repository to clone from is on a local machine,
	this flag bypasses the normal "git aware" transport
	mechanism and clones the repository by making a copy of
	HEAD and everything under objects and refs directories.
	The files under `.git/objects/` directory are hardlinked
	to save space when possible.
+
If the repository is specified as a local path (e.g., `/path/to/repo`),
this is the default, and --local is essentially a no-op.  If the
repository is specified as a URL, then this flag is ignored (and we
never use the local optimizations).  Specifying `--no-local` will
override the default when `/path/to/repo` is given, using the regular
git transport instead.
+
To force copying instead of hardlinking (which may be desirable if you
are trying to make a back-up of your repository), but still avoid the
usual "git aware" transport mechanism, `--no-hardlinks` can be used.

--no-hardlinks::
	Optimize the cloning process from a repository on a
	local filesystem by copying files under `.git/objects`
	directory.

--shared::
-s::
	When the repository to clone is on the local machine,
	instead of using hard links, automatically setup
	`.git/objects/info/alternates` to share the objects
	with the source repository.  The resulting repository
	starts out without any object of its own.
+
*NOTE*: this is a possibly dangerous operation; do *not* use
it unless you understand what it does. If you clone your
repository using this option and then delete branches (or use any
other git command that makes any existing commit unreferenced) in the
source repository, some objects may become unreferenced (or dangling).
These objects may be removed by normal git operations (such as `git commit`)
which automatically call `git gc --auto`. (See linkgit:git-gc[1].)
If these objects are removed and were referenced by the cloned repository,
then the cloned repository will become corrupt.
+
Note that running `git repack` without the `-l` option in a repository
cloned with `-s` will copy objects from the source repository into a pack
in the cloned repository, removing the disk space savings of `clone -s`.
It is safe, however, to run `git gc`, which uses the `-l` option by
default.
+
If you want to break the dependency of a repository cloned with `-s` on
its source repository, you can simply run `git repack -a` to copy all
objects from the source repository into a pack in the cloned repository.

--reference <repository>::
	If the reference repository is on the local machine,
	automatically setup `.git/objects/info/alternates` to
	obtain objects from the reference repository.  Using
	an already existing repository as an alternate will
	require fewer objects to be copied from the repository
	being cloned, reducing network and local storage costs.
+
*NOTE*: see the NOTE for the `--shared` option.

--quiet::
-q::
	Operate quietly.  Progress is not reported to the standard
	error stream. This flag is also passed to the `rsync'
	command when given.

--verbose::
-v::
	Run verbosely. Does not affect the reporting of progress status
	to the standard error stream.

--progress::
	Progress status is reported on the standard error stream
	by default when it is attached to a terminal, unless -q
	is specified. This flag forces progress status even if the
	standard error stream is not directed to a terminal.

--no-checkout::
-n::
	No checkout of HEAD is performed after the clone is complete.

--bare::
	Make a 'bare' GIT repository.  That is, instead of
	creating `<directory>` and placing the administrative
	files in `<directory>/.git`, make the `<directory>`
	itself the `$GIT_DIR`. This obviously implies the `-n`
	because there is nowhere to check out the working tree.
	Also the branch heads at the remote are copied directly
	to corresponding local branch heads, without mapping
	them to `refs/remotes/origin/`.  When this option is
	used, neither remote-tracking branches nor the related
	configuration variables are created.

--mirror::
	Set up a mirror of the source repository.  This implies `--bare`.
	Compared to `--bare`, `--mirror` not only maps local branches of the
	source to local branches of the target, it maps all refs (including
	remote-tracking branches, notes etc.) and sets up a refspec configuration such
	that all these refs are overwritten by a `git remote update` in the
	target repository.

--origin <name>::
-o <name>::
	Instead of using the remote name `origin` to keep track
	of the upstream repository, use `<name>`.

--branch <name>::
-b <name>::
	Instead of pointing the newly created HEAD to the branch pointed
	to by the cloned repository's HEAD, point to `<name>` branch
	instead. In a non-bare repository, this is the branch that will
	be checked out.
	`--branch` can also take tags and detaches the HEAD at that commit
	in the resulting repository.

--upload-pack <upload-pack>::
-u <upload-pack>::
	When given, and the repository to clone from is accessed
	via ssh, this specifies a non-default path for the command
	run on the other end.

--template=<template_directory>::
	Specify the directory from which templates will be used;
	(See the "TEMPLATE DIRECTORY" section of linkgit:git-init[1].)

--config <key>=<value>::
-c <key>=<value>::
	Set a configuration variable in the newly-created repository;
	this takes effect immediately after the repository is
	initialized, but before the remote history is fetched or any
	files checked out.  The key is in the same format as expected by
	linkgit:git-config[1] (e.g., `core.eol=true`). If multiple
	values are given for the same key, each value will be written to
	the config file. This makes it safe, for example, to add
	additional fetch refspecs to the origin remote.

--depth <depth>::
	Create a 'shallow' clone with a history truncated to the
	specified number of revisions.  A shallow repository has a
	number of limitations (you cannot clone or fetch from
	it, nor push from nor into it), but is adequate if you
	are only interested in the recent history of a large project
	with a long history, and would want to send in fixes
	as patches.

--single-branch::
	Clone only the history leading to the tip of a single branch,
	either specified by the `--branch` option or the primary
	branch remote's `HEAD` points at. When creating a shallow
	clone with the `--depth` option, this is the default, unless
	`--no-single-branch` is given to fetch the histories near the
	tips of all branches.
	Further fetches into the resulting repository will only update the
	remote-tracking branch for the branch this option was used for the
	initial cloning.  If the HEAD at the remote did not point at any
	branch when `--single-branch` clone was made, no remote-tracking
	branch is created.

--recursive::
--recurse-submodules::
	After the clone is created, initialize all submodules within,
	using their default settings. This is equivalent to running
	`git submodule update --init --recursive` immediately after
	the clone is finished. This option is ignored if the cloned
	repository does not have a worktree/checkout (i.e. if any of
	`--no-checkout`/`-n`, `--bare`, or `--mirror` is given)

--separate-git-dir=<git dir>::
	Instead of placing the cloned repository where it is supposed
	to be, place the cloned repository at the specified directory,
	then make a filesytem-agnostic git symbolic link to there.
	The result is git repository can be separated from working
	tree.


<repository>::
	The (possibly remote) repository to clone from.  See the
	<<URLS,URLS>> section below for more information on specifying
	repositories.

<directory>::
	The name of a new directory to clone into.  The "humanish"
	part of the source repository is used if no directory is
	explicitly given (`repo` for `/path/to/repo.git` and `foo`
	for `host.xz:foo/.git`).  Cloning into an existing directory
	is only allowed if the directory is empty.
