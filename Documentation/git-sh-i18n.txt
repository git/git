NAME
----
but-sh-i18n - Git's i18n setup code for shell scripts

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'. "$(but --exec-path)/but-sh-i18n"'

DESCRIPTION
-----------

This is not a command the end user would want to run.  Ever.
This documentation is meant for people who are studying the
Porcelain-ish scripts and/or are writing new ones.

The 'but sh-i18n scriptlet is designed to be sourced (using
`.`) by Git's porcelain programs implemented in shell
script. It provides wrappers for the GNU `gettext` and
`eval_gettext` functions accessible through the `gettext.sh`
script, and provides pass-through fallbacks on systems
without GNU gettext.

FUNCTIONS
---------

gettext::
	Currently a dummy fall-through function implemented as a wrapper
	around `printf(1)`. Will be replaced by a real gettext
	implementation in a later version.

eval_gettext::
	Currently a dummy fall-through function implemented as a wrapper
	around `printf(1)` with variables expanded by the
	linkbut:but-sh-i18n{litdd}envsubst[1] helper. Will be replaced by a
	real gettext implementation in a later version.
