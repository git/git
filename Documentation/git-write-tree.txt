NAME
----
but-write-tree - Create a tree object from the current index


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'but write-tree' [--missing-ok] [--prefix=<prefix>/]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Creates a tree object using the current index. The name of the new
tree object is printed to standard output.

The index must be in a fully merged state.

Conceptually, 'but write-tree' sync()s the current index contents
into a set of tree files.
In order to have that match what is actually in your directory right
now, you need to have done a 'but update-index' phase before you did the
'but write-tree'.


OPTIONS
-------
--missing-ok::
	Normally 'but write-tree' ensures that the objects referenced by the
	directory exist in the object database.  This option disables this
	check.

--prefix=<prefix>/::
	Writes a tree object that represents a subdirectory
	`<prefix>`.  This can be used to write the tree object
	for a subproject that is in the named subdirectory.
