GIT v1.5.6.3 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.5.6.2
--------------------

* Setting GIT_TRACE will report spawning of external process via run_command().

* Bash completion script did not notice '--' marker on the command
  line and tried the relatively slow "ref completion" even when
  completing arguments after one.

* Registering a non-empty blob racily and then truncating the working
  tree file for it confused "racy-git avoidance" logic into thinking
  that the path is now unchanged.

* "git clone" had a leftover debugging fprintf().

* "git clone -q" was not quiet enough as it used to and gave object count
  and progress reports.

* "git clone" marked downloaded packfile with .keep; this could be a
  good thing if the remote side is well packed but otherwise not,
  especially for a project that is not really big.

* The section that describes attributes related to git-archive were placed
  in a wrong place in the gitattributes(5) manual page.

* When "git push" tries to remove a remote ref, and corresponding
  tracking ref is missing, we used to report error (i.e. failure to
  remove something that does not exist).

* "git mailinfo" (hence "git am") did not handle commit log messages in a
  MIME multipart mail correctly.

Contains other various documentation fixes.
