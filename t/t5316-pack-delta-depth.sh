test_description='pack-objects breaks long cross-pack delta chains'

# This mirrors a repeated push setup:
#
# 1. A client repeatedly modifies some files, makes a
#      commit, and pushes the result. It does this N times
#      before we get around to repacking.
#
# 2. Each push generates a thin pack with the new version of
#    various objects. Let's consider some file in the root tree
#    which is updated in each commit.
#
#    When generating push number X, we feed commit X-1 (and
#    thus blob X-1) as a preferred base. The resulting pack has
#    blob X as a thin delta against blob X-1.
#
#    On the receiving end, "index-pack --fix-thin" will
#    complete the pack with a base copy of blob X-1.
#
# 3. In older versions of git, if we used the delta from
#    pack X, then we'd always find blob X-1 as a base in the
#    same pack (and generate a fresh delta).
#
#    But with the pack mru, we jump from delta to delta
#    following the traversal order:
#
#      a. We grab blob X from pack X as a delta, putting it at
#         the tip of our mru list.
#
#      b. Eventually we move onto commit X-1. We need other
#         objects which are only in pack X-1 (in the test code
#         below, it's the containing tree). That puts pack X-1
#         at the tip of our mru list.
#
#      c. Eventually we look for blob X-1, and we find the
#         version in pack X-1 (because it's the mru tip).
#
# Now we have blob X as a delta against X-1, which is a delta
# against X-2, and so forth.
#
# In the real world, these small pushes would get exploded by
# unpack-objects rather than "index-pack --fix-thin", but the
# same principle applies to larger pushes (they only need one
# repeatedly-modified file to generate the delta chain).
