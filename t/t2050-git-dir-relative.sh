test_description='check problems with relative GIT_DIR

This test creates a working tree state with a file and subdir:

  top (committed several times)
  subdir (a subdirectory)

It creates a commit-hook and tests it, then moves .git
into the subdir while keeping the worktree location,
and tries commits from the top and the subdir, checking
that the commit-hook still gets called.'
