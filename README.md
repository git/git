# git

A custom implementation and exploration of Git internals, concepts, and utilities.

## Overview

This repository contains experimental code, scripts, and documentation to understand and mimic core Git functionality. It is intended for educational and exploratory purposes, offering insights into version control mechanics.

## Features

- Custom scripts for versioning and tracking changes
- Utilities to compare with official Git operations
- Educational documentation on Git internals
- Sample code for hashing, object management, and more

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/) (if scripts require Python)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (for reference and comparison)

### Setup

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/nodoubtz/git.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the directory:
   ```sh
   cd git
   ```
3. Follow any specific setup instructions in the relevant folders.

## Usage

- Explore the scripts to learn how basic Git operations can be implemented from scratch.
- Refer to documentation and comments for explanations.
