/*
 * File write-locks as used by Git.
 *
 * The lockfile API serves two purposes:
 *
 * * Mutual exclusion and atomic file updates. When we want to change
 *   a file, we create a lockfile `<filename>.lock`, write the new
 *   file contents into it, and then rename the lockfile to its final
 *   destination `<filename>`. We create the `<filename>.lock` file
 *   with `O_CREAT|O_EXCL` so that we can notice and fail if somebody
 *   else has already locked the file, then atomically rename the
 *   lockfile to its final destination to commit the changes and
 *   unlock the file.
 *
 * * Automatic cruft removal. If the program exits after we lock a
 *   file but before the changes have been committed, we want to make
 *   sure that we remove the lockfile. This is done by remembering the
 *   lockfiles we have created in a linked list and setting up an
 *   `atexit(3)` handler and a signal handler that clean up the
 *   lockfiles. This mechanism ensures that outstanding lockfiles are
 *   cleaned up if the program exits (including when `die()` is
 *   called) or if the program is terminated by a signal.
 *
 * Please note that lockfiles only block other writers. Readers do not
 * block, but they are guaranteed to see either the old contents of
 * the file or the new contents of the file (assuming that the
 * filesystem implements `rename(2)` atomically).
 *
 * Most of the heavy lifting is done by the tempfile module (see
 * "tempfile.h").
 *
 * Calling sequence
 * ----------------
 *
 * The caller:
 *
 * * Allocates a `struct lock_file` with whatever storage duration you
 *   desire. The struct does not have to be initialized before being
 *   used, but it is good practice to do so using by setting it to
 *   all-zeros (or using the LOCK_INIT macro). This puts the object in a
 *   consistent state that allows you to call rollback_lock_file() even
 *   if the lock was never taken (in which case it is a noop).
 *
 * * Attempts to create a lockfile by calling `hold_lock_file_for_update()`.
 *
 * * Writes new content for the destination file by either:
 *
 *   * writing to the file descriptor returned by the
 *     `hold_lock_file_for_*()` functions (also available via
 *     `lock->fd`).
 *
 *   * calling `fdopen_lock_file()` to get a `FILE` pointer for the
 *     open file and writing to the file using stdio.
 *
 *   Note that the file descriptor returned by hold_lock_file_for_update()
 *   is marked O_CLOEXEC, so the new contents must be written by the
 *   current process, not a spawned one.
 *
 * When finished writing, the caller can:
 *
 * * Close the file descriptor and rename the lockfile to its final
 *   destination by calling `commit_lock_file()` or
 *   `commit_lock_file_to()`.
 *
 * * Close the file descriptor and remove the lockfile by calling
 *   `rollback_lock_file()`.
 *
 * * Close the file descriptor without removing or renaming the
 *   lockfile by calling `close_lock_file_gently()`, and later call
 *   `commit_lock_file()`, `commit_lock_file_to()`,
 *   `rollback_lock_file()`, or `reopen_lock_file()`.
 *
 * After the lockfile is committed or rolled back, the `lock_file`
 * object can be discarded or reused.
 *
 * If the program exits before `commit_lock_file()`,
 * `commit_lock_file_to()`, or `rollback_lock_file()` is called, the
 * tempfile module will close and remove the lockfile, thereby rolling
 * back any uncommitted changes.
 *
 * If you need to close the file descriptor you obtained from a
 * `hold_lock_file_for_*()` function yourself, do so by calling
 * `close_lock_file_gently()`. See "tempfile.h" for more information.
 *
 *
 * Under the covers, a lockfile is just a tempfile with a few helper
 * functions. In particular, the state diagram and the cleanup
 * machinery are all implemented in the tempfile module.
 *
 * Permission bits
 * ---------------
 *
 * If you call either `hold_lock_file_for_update_mode` or
 * `hold_lock_file_for_update_timeout_mode`, you can specify a suggested
 * mode for the underlying temporary file. Note that the file isn't
 * guaranteed to have this exact mode, since it may be limited by either
 * the umask, 'core.sharedRepository', or both. See `adjust_shared_perm`
 * for more.
 *
 * Error handling
 * --------------
 *
 * The `hold_lock_file_for_*()` functions return a file descriptor on
 * success or -1 on failure (unless `LOCK_DIE_ON_ERROR` is used; see
 * "flags" below). On errors, `errno` describes the reason for
 * failure. Errors can be reported by passing `errno` to
 * `unable_to_lock_message()` or `unable_to_lock_die()`.
 *
 * Similarly, `commit_lock_file`, `commit_lock_file_to`, and
 * `close_lock_file` return 0 on success. On failure they set `errno`
 * appropriately and return -1. The `commit` variants (but not `close`)
 * do their best to delete the temporary file before returning.
