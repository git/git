 *
 * - start_committish is the commit-ish, in repository r, that determines
 *   which commits the branches will point to. The superproject branch
 *   will point to the commit of start_committish and the submodule
 *   branches will point to the gitlink commit oids in start_committish's
 *   tree.
 *
 * - tracking_name is the name of the ref, in repository r, that will be
 *   used to set up tracking information. This value is propagated to
 *   all submodules, which will evaluate the ref using their own ref
 *   stores. If NULL, this defaults to start_committish.
 *
 * When this function is called on the superproject, start_committish
 * can be any user-provided ref and tracking_name can be NULL (similar
 * to create_branches()). But when recursing through submodules,
 * start_committish is the plain gitlink commit oid. Since the oid cannot
 * be used for tracking information, tracking_name is propagated and
 * used for tracking instead.
