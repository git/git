/*
 * Handle temporary files.
 *
 * The tempfile API allows temporary files to be created, deleted, and
 * atomically renamed. Temporary files that are still active when the
 * program ends are cleaned up automatically. Lockfiles (see
 * "lockfile.h") are built on top of this API.
 *
 *
 * Calling sequence
 * ----------------
 *
 * The caller:
 *
 * * Attempts to create a temporary file by calling
 *   `create_tempfile()`. The resources used for the temporary file are
 *   managed by the tempfile API.
 *
 * * Writes new content to the file by either:
 *
 *   * writing to the `tempfile->fd` file descriptor
 *
 *   * calling `fdopen_tempfile()` to get a `FILE` pointer for the
 *     open file and writing to the file using stdio.
 *
 *   Note that the file descriptor created by create_tempfile()
 *   is marked O_CLOEXEC, so the new contents must be written by
 *   the current process, not any spawned one.
 *
 * When finished writing, the caller can:
 *
 * * Close the file descriptor and remove the temporary file by
 *   calling `delete_tempfile()`.
 *
 * * Close the temporary file and rename it atomically to a specified
 *   filename by calling `rename_tempfile()`. This relinquishes
 *   control of the file.
 *
 * * Close the file descriptor without removing or renaming the
 *   temporary file by calling `close_tempfile_gently()`, and later call
 *   `delete_tempfile()` or `rename_tempfile()`.
 *
 * After the temporary file is renamed or deleted, the `tempfile`
 * object is no longer valid and should not be reused.
 *
 * If the program exits before `rename_tempfile()` or
 * `delete_tempfile()` is called, an `atexit(3)` handler will close
 * and remove the temporary file.
 *
 * If you need to close the file descriptor yourself, do so by calling
 * `close_tempfile_gently()`. You should never call `close(2)` or `fclose(3)`
 * yourself, otherwise the `struct tempfile` structure would still
 * think that the file descriptor needs to be closed, and a later
 * cleanup would result in duplicate calls to `close(2)`. Worse yet,
 * if you close and then later open another file descriptor for a
 * completely different purpose, then the unrelated file descriptor
 * might get closed.
 *
 *
 * Error handling
 * --------------
 *
 * `create_tempfile()` returns an allocated tempfile on success or NULL
 * on failure. On errors, `errno` describes the reason for failure.
 *
 * `rename_tempfile()` and `close_tempfile_gently()` return 0 on success.
 * On failure they set `errno` appropriately and return -1.
 * `delete_tempfile()` and `rename` (but not `close`) do their best to
 * delete the temporary file before returning.

 * mks_tempfile functions
 *
 * The following functions attempt to create and open temporary files
 * with names derived automatically from a template, in the manner of
 * mkstemps(), and arrange for them to be deleted if the program ends
 * before they are deleted explicitly. There is a whole family of such
 * functions, named according to the following pattern:
 *
 *     x?mks_tempfile_t?s?m?()
 *
 * The optional letters have the following meanings:
 *
 *   x - die if the temporary file cannot be created.
 *
 *   t - create the temporary file under $TMPDIR (as opposed to
 *       relative to the current directory). When these variants are
 *       used, template should be the pattern for the filename alone,
 *       without a path.
 *
 *   s - template includes a suffix that is suffixlen characters long.
 *
 *   m - the temporary file should be created with the specified mode
 *       (otherwise, the mode is set to 0600).
 *
 * None of these functions modify template. If the caller wants to
 * know the (absolute) path of the file that was created, it can be
 * read from tempfile->filename.
 *
 * On success, the functions return a tempfile whose "fd" member is open
 * for writing the temporary file. On errors, they return NULL and set
 * errno appropriately (except for the "x" variants, which die() on
 * errors).
