 * Calling sequence:
 * ----------------
 *
 * - Prepare a `struct ll_merge_options` to record options.
 *   If you have no special requests, skip this and pass `NULL`
 *   as the `opts` parameter to use the default options.
 *
 * - Allocate an mmbuffer_t variable for the result.
 *
 * - Allocate and fill variables with the file's original content
 *   and two modified versions (using `read_mmfile`, for example).
 *
 * - Call `ll_merge()`.
 *
 * - Read the merged content from `result_buf.ptr` and `result_buf.size`.
 *
 * - Release buffers when finished.  A simple
 *   `free(ancestor.ptr); free(ours.ptr); free(theirs.ptr);
 *   free(result_buf.ptr);` will do.
 *
 * If the modifications do not merge cleanly, `ll_merge` will return a
 * nonzero value and `result_buf` will generally include a description of
 * the conflict bracketed by markers such as the traditional `<<<<<<<`
 * and `>>>>>>>`.
 *
 * The `ancestor_label`, `our_label`, and `their_label` parameters are
 * used to label the different sides of a conflict if the merge driver
 * supports this.
