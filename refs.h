 * Resolve a reference, recursively following symbolic references.
 *
 * Return the name of the non-symbolic reference that ultimately pointed
 * at the resolved object name.  The return value, if not NULL, is a
 * pointer into either a static buffer or the input ref.
 *
 * If oid is non-NULL, store the referred-to object's name in it.
 *
 * If the reference cannot be resolved to an object, the behavior
 * depends on the RESOLVE_REF_READING flag:
 *
 * - If RESOLVE_REF_READING is set, return NULL.
 *
 * - If RESOLVE_REF_READING is not set, clear oid and return the name of
 *   the last reference name in the chain, which will either be a non-symbolic
 *   reference or an undefined reference.  If this is a prelude to
 *   "writing" to the ref, the return value is the name of the ref
 *   that will actually be created or changed.
 *
 * If the RESOLVE_REF_NO_RECURSE flag is passed, only resolves one
 * level of symbolic reference.  The value stored in oid for a symbolic
 * reference will always be null_oid in this case, and the return
 * value is the reference that the symref refers to directly.
 *
 * If flags is non-NULL, set the value that it points to the
 * combination of REF_ISPACKED (if the reference was found among the
 * packed references), REF_ISSYMREF (if the initial reference was a
 * symbolic reference), REF_BAD_NAME (if the reference name is ill
 * formed --- see RESOLVE_REF_ALLOW_BAD_NAME below), and REF_ISBROKEN
 * (if the ref is malformed or has a bad name). See refs.h for more detail
 * on each flag.
 *
 * If ref is not a properly-formatted, normalized reference, return
 * NULL.  If more than MAXDEPTH recursive symbolic lookups are needed,
 * give up and return NULL.
 *
 * RESOLVE_REF_ALLOW_BAD_NAME allows resolving refs even when their
 * name is invalid according to git-check-ref-format(1).  If the name
 * is bad then the value stored in oid will be null_oid and the two
 * flags REF_ISBROKEN and REF_BAD_NAME will be set.
 *
 * Even with RESOLVE_REF_ALLOW_BAD_NAME, names that escape the refs/
 * directory and do not consist of all caps and underscores cannot be
 * resolved. The function returns NULL for such ref names.
 * Caps and underscores refers to the pseudorefs, such as HEAD,
 * FETCH_HEAD and friends, that all live outside of the refs/ directory.

 * A ref_transaction represents a collection of reference updates that
 * should succeed or fail together.
 *
 * Calling sequence
 * ----------------
 *
 * - Allocate and initialize a `struct ref_transaction` by calling
 *   `ref_transaction_begin()`.
 *
 * - Specify the intended ref updates by calling one or more of the
 *   following functions:
 *   - `ref_transaction_update()`
 *   - `ref_transaction_create()`
 *   - `ref_transaction_delete()`
 *   - `ref_transaction_verify()`
 *
 * - Then either:
 *
 *   - Optionally call `ref_transaction_prepare()` to prepare the
 *     transaction. This locks all references, checks preconditions,
 *     etc. but doesn't finalize anything. If this step fails, the
 *     transaction has been closed and can only be freed. If this step
 *     succeeds, then `ref_transaction_commit()` is almost certain to
 *     succeed. However, you can still call `ref_transaction_abort()`
 *     if you decide not to commit the transaction after all.
 *
 *   - Call `ref_transaction_commit()` to execute the transaction,
 *     make the changes permanent, and release all locks. If you
 *     haven't already called `ref_transaction_prepare()`, then
 *     `ref_transaction_commit()` calls it for you.
 *
 *   Or
 *
 *   - Call `initial_ref_transaction_commit()` if the ref database is
 *     known to be empty and have no other writers (e.g. during
 *     clone). This is likely to be much faster than
 *     `ref_transaction_commit()`. `ref_transaction_prepare()` should
 *     *not* be called before `initial_ref_transaction_commit()`.
 *
 * - Then finally, call `ref_transaction_free()` to free the
 *   `ref_transaction` data structure.
 *
 * At any time before calling `ref_transaction_commit()`, you can call
 * `ref_transaction_abort()` to abort the transaction, rollback any
 * locks, and free any associated resources (including the
 * `ref_transaction` data structure).
 *
 * Putting it all together, a complete reference update looks like
 *
 *         struct ref_transaction *transaction;
 *         struct strbuf err = STRBUF_INIT;
 *         int ret = 0;
 *
 *         transaction = ref_store_transaction_begin(refs, &err);
 *         if (!transaction ||
 *             ref_transaction_update(...) ||
 *             ref_transaction_create(...) ||
 *             ...etc... ||
 *             ref_transaction_commit(transaction, &err)) {
 *                 error("%s", err.buf);
 *                 ret = -1;
 *         }
 *         ref_transaction_free(transaction);
 *         strbuf_release(&err);
 *         return ret;
 *
 * Error handling
 * --------------
 *
 * On error, transaction functions append a message about what
 * went wrong to the 'err' argument.  The message mentions what
 * ref was being updated (if any) when the error occurred so it
 * can be passed to 'die' or 'error' as-is.
 *
 * The message is appended to err without first clearing err.
 * err will not be '\n' terminated.
 *
 * Caveats
 * -------
 *
 * Note that no locks are taken, and no refs are read, until
 * `ref_transaction_prepare()` or `ref_transaction_commit()` is
 * called. So, for example, `ref_transaction_verify()` won't report a
 * verification failure until the commit is attempted.

 *

 *         from ref_transaction_begin().
 *
 *     refname -- the name of the reference to be affected.
 *
 *     new_oid -- the object ID that should be set to be the new value
 *         of the reference. Some functions allow this parameter to be
 *         NULL, meaning that the reference is not changed, or
 *         null_oid, meaning that the reference should be deleted. A
 *         copy of this value is made in the transaction.
 *
 *     old_oid -- the object ID that the reference must have before
 *         the update. Some functions allow this parameter to be NULL,
 *         meaning that the old value of the reference is not checked,
 *         or null_oid, meaning that the reference must not exist
 *         before the update. A copy of this value is made in the
 *         transaction.
 *
 *     new_target -- the target reference that the reference will be
 *         updated to point to. If the reference is a regular reference,
 *         it will be converted to a symbolic reference. Cannot be set
 *         together with `new_oid`. A copy of this value is made in the
 *         transaction.
 *
 *     old_target -- the reference that the reference must be pointing to.
 *         Canont be set together with `old_oid`. A copy of this value is
 *         made in the transaction.
 *
 *     flags -- flags affecting the update, passed to
 *         update_ref_lock(). Possible flags: REF_NO_DEREF,
 *         REF_FORCE_CREATE_REFLOG. See those constants for more
 *         information.
 *
 *     msg -- a message describing the change (for the reflog).
 *
 *     err -- a strbuf for receiving a description of any error that
 *         might have occurred.
 *
 * The functions make internal copies of refname and msg, so the
 * caller retains ownership of these parameters.
 *
 * The functions return 0 on success and non-zero on failure. A
 * failure means that the transaction as a whole has failed and needs
 * to be rolled back.

 * this:
 *
 * 	const char *path = "path/to/submodule"

 * 		die("Error submodule '%s' not populated.", path);
 *
 * `add_submodule_odb()` will return zero on success. If you
 * do not do this you will get an error for each ref that it does not point
 * to a valid object.
 *
 * Note: As a side-effect of this you cannot safely assume that all
 * objects you lookup are available in superproject. All submodule objects
 * will be available the same way as the superprojects objects.
 *
 * Example:
 * --------
 *
 * ----
 * static int handle_remote_ref(const char *refname,
