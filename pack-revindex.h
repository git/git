/**
 * A revindex allows converting efficiently between three properties
 * of an object within a pack:
 *
 * - index position: the numeric position within the list of sorted object ids
 *   found in the .idx file
 *
 * - pack position: the numeric position within the list of objects in their
 *   order within the actual .pack file (i.e., 0 is the first object in the
 *   .pack, 1 is the second, and so on)
 *
 * - offset: the byte offset within the .pack file at which the object contents
 *   can be found
 *
 * The revindex can also be used with a multi-pack index (MIDX). In this
 * setting:
 *
 *   - index position refers to an object's numeric position within the MIDX
 *
 *   - pack position refers to an object's position within a non-existent pack
 *     described by the MIDX. The pack structure is described in
 *     gitformat-pack(5).
 *
 *     It is effectively a concatanation of all packs in the MIDX (ordered by
 *     their numeric ID within the MIDX) in their original order within each
 *     pack), removing duplicates, and placing the preferred pack (if any)
 *     first.
