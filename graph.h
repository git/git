/**
 * The graph API is used to draw a text-based representation of the commit
 * history. The API generates the graph in a line-by-line fashion.
 *
 * Calling sequence
 * ----------------
 *
 * - Create a `struct git_graph` by calling `graph_init()`.  When using the
 *   revision walking API, this is done automatically by `setup_revisions()` if
 *   the '--graph' option is supplied.
 *
 * - Use the revision walking API to walk through a group of contiguous commits.
 *   The `get_revision()` function automatically calls `graph_update()` each
 * time it is invoked.
 *
 * - For each commit, call `graph_next_line()` repeatedly, until
 *   `graph_is_commit_finished()` returns non-zero.  Each call to
 *   `graph_next_line()` will output a single line of the graph.  The resulting
 *   lines will not contain any newlines.  `graph_next_line()` returns 1 if the
 *   resulting line contains the current commit, or 0 if this is merely a line
 *   needed to adjust the graph before or after the current commit.  This return
 *   value can be used to determine where to print the commit summary
 * information alongside the graph output.
 *
 * Limitations
 * -----------
 * - Check the graph_update() function for its limitations.
 *
 * - The graph API does not currently support reverse commit ordering.  In
 *   order to implement reverse ordering, the graphing API needs an
 *   (efficient) mechanism to find the children of a commit.
 *
 * Sample usage
 * ------------
 *
 * ------------
 * struct commit *commit;
 * struct git_graph *graph = graph_init(opts);
 *
 * while ((commit = get_revision(opts)) != NULL) {
 * 	while (!graph_is_commit_finished(graph))
 * 	{
 * 		struct strbuf sb;
 * 		int is_commit_line;
 *
 * 		strbuf_init(&sb, 0);
 * 		is_commit_line = graph_next_line(graph, &sb);
 * 		fputs(sb.buf, stdout);
 *
 * 		if (is_commit_line)
 * 			log_tree_commit(opts, commit);
 * 		else
 * 			putchar(opts->diffopt.line_termination);
 * 	}
 * }
 * ------------
 * Sample output
 * -------------
 *
 * The following is an example of the output from the graph API.  This output
 * does not include any commit summary information--callers are responsible for
 * outputting that information, if desired.

 * which denotes the escape for resetting the color back to the default.
 * When generating the graph, strings from this array are inserted before
 * and after the various column characters.
 *
 * This function allows you to enable a custom array of color escapes.
 * The 'colors_max' argument is the index of the last "reset" entry.

 * Limitations:
 * -----------
 *
 * - `graph_update()` must be called with commits in topological order.  It
 * should not be called on a commit if it has already been invoked with an
 * ancestor of that commit, or the graph output will be incorrect.
 *
 * - `graph_update()` must be called on a contiguous group of commits.  If
 *   `graph_update()` is called on a particular commit, it should later be
 * called on all parents of that commit.  Parents must not be skipped, or the
 * graph output will appear incorrect.
 *
 * - `graph_update()` may be used on a pruned set of commits only if the parent
 * list has been rewritten so as to include only ancestors from the pruned set.
