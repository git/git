What's cooking in git.git (Jun 2008, issue #04; Mon, 30)
--------------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed
with '-' are only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are
in 'next'.

The topics list the commits in reverse chronological order.  The topics
meant to be applied to the maintenance series have "maint-" in their
names.

It already is beginning to become clear what 1.6.0 will look like.  What's
already in 'next' all are well intentioned (I do not guarantee they are
already bug-free --- that is what cooking them in 'next' is for) and are
good set of feature enhancements.  Bigger changes will be:

 * MinGW will be in.

 * With the default Makefile settings, most of the programs will be
   installed outside your $PATH, except for "git", "gitk", "git-gui" and
   some server side programs that need to be accessible for technical
   reasons.  Invoking a git subcommand as "git-xyzzy" from the command
   line has been deprecated since early 2006 (and officially announced in
   1.5.4 release notes); use of them from your scripts after adding
   output from "git --exec-path" to the $PATH will still be supported in
   1.6.0, but users are again strongly encouraged to adjust their
   scripts to use "git xyzzy" form, as we will stop installing
   "git-xyzzy" hardlinks for built-in commands in later releases.

 * git-merge will be rewritten in C.

 * default pack and idx versions will be updated as scheduled for some
   time ago.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Will merge to master soon]

* nd/dashless (Tue Jun 24 19:58:11 2008 -0700) 2 commits
 + Keep some git-* programs in $(bindir)
 + Move all dashed-form commands to libexecdir

Scheduled for 1.6.0.  We'll leave server-side programs in $(bindir) so
that ssh clients can ask for "git-program" and find them on the $PATH.
Next major release after 1.6.0 would most likely remove the hardlinks to
built-in commands, but not yet.

* sg/merge-options (Sun Apr 6 03:23:47 2008 +0200) 1 commit
 + merge: remove deprecated summary and diffstat options and config
   variables

* jc/dashless (Thu Jun 26 16:43:34 2008 -0700) 4 commits
 + Revert "Make clients ask for "git program" over ssh and local
   transport"
 + Make clients ask for "git program" over ssh and local transport
 + Prepare execv_git_cmd() for removal of builtins from the
   filesystem
 + git-shell: accept "git foo" form

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Actively Cooking]

* jk/maint-fetch-ref-hier (Fri Jun 27 00:01:41 2008 -0400) 2 commits
 + fetch: give a hint to the user when local refs fail to update
 + fetch: report local storage errors in status table

When the remote used to have "foo" branch but now has "foo/bar", fetch
refuses to delete the existing remote tracking branch "foo" to create a
new remote tracking branch "foo/bar", but the error message was
confusing.

* jc/maint-reset (Wed Jun 25 18:16:36 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 + Allow "git-reset path" when unambiguous

We used to require "git-reset -- path" even when there is no ambiguity
(i.e. path cannot be mistaken as a valid tree-ish and it is a filename in
the work tree).

* js/maint-clone-insteadof (Fri Jun 27 13:55:23 2008 +0100) 2 commits
 + clone: respect the settings in $HOME/.gitconfig and /etc/gitconfig
 + clone: respect url.insteadOf setting in global configs

"git clone" did not honor "url.InsteadOf" in $HOME/.gitconfig.  I think
Daniel's "Let's get rid of internal use of GIT_CONFIG" makes sense (even
though it feels very scary), and it would make the solution much simpler,
but it came late and it is already past my bedtime, so...

* tr/send-email-ssl (Thu Jun 26 23:03:21 2008 +0200) 2 commits
 + git-send-email: prevent undefined variable warnings if no
   encryption is set
 + git-send-email: add support for TLS via Net::SMTP::SSL

* kb/send-email-fifo (Wed Jun 25 15:44:40 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 + git-send-email: Accept fifos as well as files

Two minor send-email feature enhancements for 1.6.0.

* jc/checkdiff (Sun Jun 29 16:49:06 2008 -0400) 7 commits
 + Fix t4017-diff-retval for white-space from wc
 + Update sample pre-commit hook to use "diff --check"
 + diff --check: detect leftover conflict markers
 + Teach "diff --check" about new blank lines at end
 + checkdiff: pass diff_options to the callback
 + check_and_emit_line(): rename and refactor
 + diff --check: explain why we do not care whether old side is
   binary

Allows us to replace the sample pre-commit hook that was not aware of the
line termination convention per path nor newer whitespace breakage rules.

* np/pack-default (Wed Jun 25 00:25:53 2008 -0400) 2 commits
 + pack.indexversion config option now defaults to 2
 + repack.usedeltabaseoffset config option now defaults to "true"

Updates the default value for pack.indexversion to 2 and use delta-base
offset encoding of the packfiles by default.

* js/apply-recount (Fri Jun 27 18:43:09 2008 +0100) 1 commit
 + Allow git-apply to recount the lines in a hunk (AKA recountdiff)

A good ingredient for implementing "apply --edit".

* dz/apply-again (Fri Jun 27 14:39:12 2008 -0400) 1 commit
 + git-apply: handle a patch that touches the same path more than
   once better

Allows us to feed a patch that touches the same path more than once.

* jc/reflog-expire (Sat Jun 28 22:24:49 2008 -0700) 2 commits
 - Make default expiration period of reflog used for stash infinite
 - Per-ref reflog expiry configuration

As 1.6.0 will be a good time to make backward incompatible changes, the
tip commit makes the default expiry period of stash 'never', unless you
configure them to expire explicitly using gc.refs/stash.* variables.
Needs consensus, but I am guessing that enough people would want stash
that does not expire.

* jc/merge-theirs (Sat Jun 28 17:28:22 2008 -0700) 3 commits
 + Teach git-merge to pass -X<option> to the backend strategy module
 + git-merge-recursive-{ours,theirs}
 + git-merge-file --ours, --theirs

Punting a merge by discarding your own work in conflicting parts but still
salvaging the parts that are cleanly automerged.  It is likely that this
will result in nonsense mishmash, but somehow often people want this, so
here they are.  The interface to the backends is updated so that you can
say "git merge -Xours -s recursive other" now.

* j6t/mingw (Sat Nov 17 20:48:14 2007 +0100) 38 commits
 + compat/pread.c: Add a forward declaration to fix a warning
 + Windows: Fix ntohl() related warnings about printf formatting

[Graduated to "master"]

----------------------------------------------------------------
[On Hold]

* ph/mergetool (Mon Jun 16 17:33:41 2008 -0600) 1 commit
 + Remove the use of '--' in merge program invocation

Waiting for success reports from people who use various backends.

* jk/renamelimit (Sat May 3 13:58:42 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 - diff: enable "too large a rename" warning when -M/-C is explicitly
   asked for

This would be the right thing to do for command line use, but gitk will be
hit due to tcl/tk's limitation, so I am holding this back for now.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Stalled/Needs more work]

* jc/blame (Wed Jun 4 22:58:40 2008 -0700) 7 commits
 - blame: show "previous" information in --porcelain/--incremental
   format
 - git-blame: refactor code to emit "porcelain format" output
 + git-blame --reverse
 + builtin-blame.c: allow more than 16 parents
 + builtin-blame.c: move prepare_final() into a separate function.
 + rev-list --children
 + revision traversal: --children option

The blame that finds where each line in the original lines moved to.  This
may help a GSoC project that wants to gather statistical overview of the
history.  The final presentation may need tweaking (see the log message of
the commit ""git-blame --reverse" on the series).

The tip two commits are for peeling to see what's behind the blamed
commit, which we should be able to separate out into an independent topic
from the rest.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Dropped for now]

 . Introduce fast forward option only
 . Head reduction before selecting merge strategy
 . Restructure git-merge.sh
 . Introduce -ff=<fast forward option>
 . New merge tests

 . Use perl instead of tac
 . Fix t3404 assumption that `wc -l` does not use whitespace.
 . rebase -i: Use : in expr command instead of match.
 . rebase -i: update the implementation of 'mark' command
 . Add option --preserve-tags

 . WIP: rethink replay merge
 . Start using replay-tree merge in cherry-pick
 . revert/cherry-pick: start refactoring call to merge_recursive

This is meant to improve cherry-pick's behaviour when renames are
involved, by not using merge-recursive (whose d/f conflict resolution is
quite broken), but unfortunately has stalled for some time now.

* jc/stripspace (Sun Mar 9 00:30:35 2008 -0800) 6 commits
 . git-am --forge: add Signed-off-by: line for the author
 . git-am: clean-up Signed-off-by: lines

   lines
 . stripspace: use parse_options()
 . Add "git am -s" test
 . git-am: refactor code to add signed-off-by line for the committer

Just my toy at this moment.
